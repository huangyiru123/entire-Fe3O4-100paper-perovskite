Stable all-perovskite tandems with interfacial dipole-bridged inorganic wide-bandgap perovskite subcells In a recent article published in Nature Energy  Hairen Tan  Edward H Sargent and their co-authors [ 1 ] reported a strongly bonding dipole molecule at the perovskite/C60 interface to reduce the energetic mismatch and accelerate charge extraction  This innovative strategy resulted in a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 185 %  with excellent operating stability over 2000 h in inverted wide-bandgap ( WBG ) all-inorganic CsPbI3–xBrx perovskite solar cells ( PSCs )  By leveraging this CsPbI3–xBrx WBG subcell  the team achieved a PCE of 256 % in all-perovskite tandem solar cells along with a T96 lifetime of 1000 h under 1-Sun operation at the maximum power point ( MPP )  This work represents an important advancement in the development of efficient and stable all-perovskite tandem solar cells  All-perovskite tandem solar cells  constructed by stacking a WBG perovskite ( ~18 eV ) front cell and a narrow-bandgap ( NBG ) perovskite ( ~12 eV ) back cell  are promising for achieving PCE above the balance limit of single-junction cells  However  the traditionally used WBG perovskite  a mixed iodine-bromine organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite with a bromine molar ratio greater than 20 %  suffers from Br–I phase segregation under light and heat  which limits the device voltage and operational stability of all-perovskite tandem solar cells  Sargent et al  [ 2 ] reported a certified open-circuit voltage ( VOC ) of 133 V in a 179 eV organicinorganic hybrid PSC by regulating the surface potential of mixed halogen perovskite  Despite this progress  the allperovskite tandem devices operating at the MPP can retain only 86 % of their initial PCE after 500-h operation [ 2 ]  which lags far behind the 20–25-year commercial application requirement [ 3 ]  To overcome this challenge  one promising material design strategy is to alternate the organicinorganic hybrid WBG perovskite with all-inorganic perovskites  which exhibits excellent photostability and thermal stability [ 4 ]  However  the PCE of all-inorganic PSCs especially with an inverted p-i-n configuration lags far behind their organicinorganic counterparts [ 5 ]  This is mainly due to poor film quality and severe interfacial defects that result in bulk and interfacial recombination  leading to a low open-circuit voltage ( VOC ) and fill factor ( FF ) in all-inorganic PSCs  Apart from the defect-induced recombination  the higher conduction band minimums ( CBM ) of all-inorganic perovskites results in a severe energy level mismatch at the perovskite/electron transporting layer ( ETL ) interface  For the devices with p-i-n configuration  the ETL of fullerene ( C60 ) limits the VOC by inducing an additional non-radiative recombination current  To address this issue  interfacial dipole layers  graded vertical heterojunctions  Lewis base molecules and conjugated organic molecules are introduced to passivate surficial traps and facilitate charge transfer at the perovskite/C60 interface  which can help reduce the VOC deficit in all-inorganic WBG PSCs  Tan et al  [ 1 ] now developed an innovative interfacial regulation strategy by introducing a serious of π-conjugated molecules with high molecular polarity at the perovskite/C60interface  They studied a phenethylammonium ( PEA )  4- fluorophenethylammonium ( F-PEA ) and 4- ( trifluoromethyl ) phenethylammonium ( CF3–PEA ) with F atom or –CF3 group at the para-position of the amino-group ( Figure 1a ) as passivators  The maximum and minimum electrostatic potential ( φmax and φmin ) sequence is : φmax  PEA < φmax  F-PEA < φmax  CF3-PEA  φmin  PEA > φmin  F-PEA > φmin  CF3-PEA  This indicates that CF3–PEA exhibits the highest binding strength between the inorganic perovskite and ETL through –NH3 + and –CF3  respectively  The high molecular polarity of CF3–PEA shows the following advantages : ( 1 ) a more effective passivation of defects at the perovskite surface ; ( 2 ) the promoted charge accumulation within C60 and accelerated interfacial charge transfer ; ( 3 ) a reduced conduction band offset ( ΔEC ) and improved electron extraction  Inverted all-inorganic CsPbI3–xBrx PSCs with the CF3–PEA interlayer exhibits noticeable VOC improvement ( 101 V to 123 V ) and FF improvement ( 807 % to 828 % ) and a high PCE of 185 % ( Figure 1b )  Encapsulated CF3–PEA devices maintained their original PCE after operating at MPP for 2000 h ( Figure 1c )  The high photostability of these devices mainly stems from the all-inorganic CsPbI3–xBrx films  which show no light-induced phase segregation even under 20 min of 10- Sun equivalent illumination  Integrating the low VOC loss and high photostability  Tan et al  [ 1 ] fabricates monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cells using CF3–PEA-passivated CsPbI3–xBrx perovskite as the WBG subcells  The tandem devices achieved a remarkable PCE of 256 % with a VOC of 200 V  short-circuit current density ( JSC ) of 161 mA cm−2 and FF of 796 %  which are comparable to those of tandem devices made with

commercialization of PSCs Optical Properties of Fe Based Perovskite and Oxygen Deficient Perovskite Structured Compounds : A ComparisonIn this work we synthesize BiFeO3 and KBiFe2O5 compounds by chemical route and analyze the bandgap reduction in KBiFe2O5  When alternate layers of corner sharing FeO6 octahedra in BiFeO3 is replaced with FeO4 tetrahedra by introducing [ ( K  Bi ) O2 ] blocks into the perovskite structure  the structure modifies to brownmillerite structure  An increase in covalency and lower bond lengths of Fe–O bonds in FeO4 tetrahedra as compared to FeO6 octahedra leads to bandgap narrowing in KBiFe2O5  The morphological  structural and optical properties of KBiFe2O5 and BiFeO3 are investigated by Scanning electron microscope  X-ray diffraction and UV-visible spectroscope respectivelyBandgap tailoring for energy application drags enormous attention in the field of materials science  Solar energy harvesting materials should have broad absorption in visible region to utilize maximum solar energy for efficient operations  KBiFe2O5 ( KBFO ) is a new brownmillerite structured multiferroic compound  which has received considerable attention for next generation photovoltaic applications [ 1 ]  The multifunctionality of multiferroics  including KBFO  with potential coupling between ferroelectric and magnetic order parameters and narrow band gaps ~159 eV makes them ideal for application as photovoltaic compounds [ 2 ]  The large absorption coefficient is attributed to the influence of magnetic ordering related to electron to electron interaction [ 3 ]  As compared to conventional perovskite multiferroics like BiFeO3 ( BFO )  Brownmillerite structured multiferroics are oxygen deficient perovskites having narrow bandgaps  The structure of BFO consists of FeO6 corner sharing octahedra  In KBFO  FeO4 tetrahedrons occupy the corners  These tetrahedral compounds are intrinsically polar due to lack of inversion symmetry [ 1  3 ]  Since KBiFe2O5 is a more recent opto-ferroic compound  it ’ s worth carrying out experimental investigations on its optical properties and compare them with those of BFO  In this work we have synthesized KBFO and BFO by chemical route and analyzed the bandgap reduction in KBFO by UV-visible spectroscopic studiesHigh pure chemicals of ( Bi ( NO3 ) 3 · 5H2O ) and ( Fe ( NO3 ) 3 · 9H2O and KNO3 were dissolved in distilled water in stoichiometric ratios  Few drops of Nitric acid were added to get a clear solution  Later Citric acid was added along with vigorous stirring  The solution was first dried around 100 °C to obtain the gel and then dried and annealed at 700 °C for 6 h to obtain the KBiFe2O5 phase  BiFeO3 was also synthesized by the chemical route  In this synthesis process  ( Bi ( NO3 ) 3 · 5H2O ) and ( Fe ( NO3 ) 3 · 9H2O ) are taken as starting precursors in equal molar ratio and dissolved in DI water  Few drops of Nitric acid were added to get a clear solution  Later Citric acid was added along with vigorous stirring  The solution was dried at 80 °C to obtain the gel and finally dried and annealed at 550 °C for 2 h to obtain the BiFeO3 phase  Bruker Smart powder X-ray diffraction system with CuKα wavelength ( λ = 15418 Å ) was used for structural analysis  UV-visible spectrometer was used for recording the optical absorbance of as synthesized samples  The morphology of samples was examined by the FESEMigure 701a  b shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of BiFeO3 and KBiFe2O5  The crystal structure of KBFO matches well with monoclinic structure having lattice parameters a = 7868 Å  b = 55978 Å and c = 5722 Å with P2c spacegroup [ 4 ]  The crystal structure of BFO matches well with rhombohedral structure having R3c spacegroup lattice parameters of a = 5597 Å  b = 5897 Å and c = 13935 Å  The ( 110 ) peak in XRD pattern of KBFO belongs to the characteristic brownmillerite peak [ 5 ] Scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) images in Fig  702a  b reveal a rectangular rod like morphology for KBFO with large grain size and sphere like morphology for BFO with much smaller grains and an average grain size of 150 nmOptical properties of as synthesized samples were recorded using UV-visible spectroscopy revealing a broad absorption spectra for KBFO when compared to BFO Fig  703  Tauc plots for corresponding UV-visible absorbance data of BFO and KBFO reveal the bandgap for BFO and KBFO to be ~21 and 167 eV respectively  as shown in inset of Fig  703a  b  The regular perovskite structure of BiFeO3 constitutes FeO6 octahedra only  whereas the brownmillerite KBFO possesses FeO4 tetrahedra along with FeO6 octahedra  The lower Fe–O bond lengths and higher covalency in FeO4 tetrahedra as compared to Fe–O bonds in FeO6 octahedra is responsible for bandgap narrowing in brownmillerite KBFO [ 4  6  7 ] Perovskite structured BiFeO3 and oxygen deficient perovskite ( Brownmillerite ) KBiFeO5 compounds have been synthesized successfully using chemical route  The band gap values of the samples have been compared along with the structural property using UV-visible spectroscopy and XRD respectivelyAir-processed and mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based perovskite films for efficient and air-stable perovskite solar cellsAbstract Metal hybrid halide perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) are very sensitive to air  and it is challenging to obtain air-processed  air-stable  and highly crystalline perovskite films  Photovoltaic performance decays dramatically due to air humidity influence with power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of most air-processed PSCs < 15 %  In this work  we develop a facile method to air-processed  highly crystalline ( MA02FA08PbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 perovskite films in ambient air with large grain size and low trap density based on mix-cation single crystal engineering  This method shows 75 % increase in grain size and 28 % decrease in trap density than conventional molecule/ion solution mixing-processed method  The large grain  low trap density  andhigh crystalline perovskite films result in high-efficient and air-stable PSCs  Consequently  the PCE increases to 367 % from 1256 % for conventional molecule/ion solution mixing-processed devices and to 1717 % for single crystal engineering-based ones  Furthermore  benefiting from high moisture resistance of mix-cation single crystal engineering-based films  the PSC air stability has been improved significantly and 72 % of the initial performance retains after 40 days of storage in ambient environment with a relative humidity of 60 % at 25 °C without any encapsulation  with a 26 % slower degradation rate than conventional solution-mixing method1 Introduction Organic–inorganic metal hybrid perovskites ( MHP ) show great potential in optoelectronics because of the excellent and promising characteristics : high absorption coefficient  high mobility  and long carrier diffusion length [ 12345 ]  MHP have been widely applied in photovoltaic cells [ 567 ]  light-emitting diodes [ 8 ]  lasers [ 9 ]  and photodetectors [ 10 ]  In particular  the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) has increased rapidly from 38 % at 2009 to over 22 % recently [ 11  12 ]  Although attracting extensive attention  PSCs still face many challenging problems including non-uniform perovskite films with high coverage [ 13 ]  high hysteresis resulting from electron–hole recombination  trap defects  and ion migration [ 141516 ]  For the cIt ’ s well known MHP perovskite films and solar cells are generally unstable and easily degraded in the ambient air especially for primary single-cation perovskites [ 3  20  21 ]  Compared with primary single-cation MAPbX3  FAPbX3 or CsPbX3 ( X = Br or I ) perovskites  mixed-cation organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have numerous advantages  such as adjustable band gap  high efficiency  and high stability [ 17  18 ]  Yang et al  have reported a high-performance device which exhibits a PCE of 1044 % using the blade-coating technique in relative humidity ( RH ) condition between 15 and 25 % [ 22 ]  Some researchers have studied the stability of perovskite in conditions of different relative humidity prepared by various methods [ 7  24252627282930 ]  However  the conventional air-processed PSCs still have much lower PCE and stability than that from inert gas environments  Recently  large grain or highly crystalline perovskite films using anti-solvent techniques or ultrafast microwave annealing are used to eliminate voids and reduce grain boundaries and surface defects [ 19  23  31 ]  In view of the advantages of mix cations and crystal engineering  it is possible to achieve air-processed  highly stable perovskite films from mix-cation single crystal engineeringHere  we develop a new method to prepare air-processed  highly crystalline perovskite films based on mixed-cation single crystal engineering ( Scheme 1 )  Different from the traditional precursor preparation strategy based on molecule/ion solution mixing  we first grow two-cation single crystal perovskites of MA1x−xFAxPbI3 ( x = 0  04  08 ) and inorganic perovskite of CsPbBr3 single crystals  Then above single crystals are dissolved in mixed N  N-dimethylformamide ( DMF ) and dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) to form precursor  respectively  Air-processed  mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based films have special characteristics  such as 75 % increase in grain size  28 % decrease in trap density  and improved film quality compared to their conventional solution-mixing counterpart  As a result  a champion-stabilized efficiency of 1717 % is successfully achieved by bigger grain size and low trap density in mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based perovskites ( MA02FA08PbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005  which shows an increases by 367 % than the 1256 % PCE of the solution-mixing-based ones  The perovskite device retains 72 % of its originalThe perovskite device retains 72 % of its original efficiency after 40 days of storage in ambient environment with a relative humidity level of 60 % without any encapsulation  with a 26 % slower degradation rate than conventional solution-mixing method  The results reveal mixed-cation single crystal engineering not only as an efficient method for preparing air-processed high-quality perovskite films but also as a facile route for achieving high-performance and air-stable PSCs2 Experimental procedures 21 Materials synthesis 211 Materials Lead iodide ( PbI2 )  cesium bromide ( CsBr

( x = 04  08 ) single crystals To obtain single crystalline MAPbI3  the molar ratio of MAI and PbI2 was fixed at 1:1  For single crystalline perovskite FA1−xMAxPbI3 ( x = 04  08 )  the molar ratios of FAI  MAI and PbI2 were 04:06:1 and 08:02:1  respectively  The solution has a concentration of 10 M in GBL and was hold at ~ 100 °C for over 12 h [ 33 ] 213 Synthesis of CsPbBr3 single crystals Single crystalline perovskite CsPbBr3 was prepared according to low-vapor saturation-based anti-solvent ( CH3OH ) method [ 34 ]  The molar ratio of CsPb and PbBr2 was 1:1  The solution concentration was set at 045 M in DMSO under continuous stirring at 50 °C until no powder was observed  After cooling down to room temperature  the DMSO solution was titrated ( drop-by-drop with continuous stirring ) by CH3OH : DMSO with volume ratio of 055:1  The saturated solution was kept at 50 °C for over 24 h 214 Precursor preparation and device fabrication The 13 M perovskite precursor solutions were obtained with dissolving the single crystals in DMF/DMSO mixture ( 7:3  volume ratio )  ITO glass ( 15 Ω sq−1 ) substrates were firstly cleaned with de-ionized water  acetone  and isopropanol by ultrasonic washing  Then the cleaned ITO was put in UV-O3 environment for 5 min  The NiO layer was deposited on ITO by spin coating the Ni ( ac ) 2 solution at 3500 rpm for 35 s in air  and then  it was annealed in air environment at 250 °C for 45 min  The perovskite films were then prepared also in air by anti-solvent method under temperature around 25 °C and humidity < 25 %  The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on NiO/ITO with 1000 rpm spinning firstly for 10 s and then 4500 rpm spinning for 25 s During the 2nd spinning step  a drop chlorobenzene was dropped directly on the spinning substrate  After the spin process  the substrates were quickly annealed on a plate at 100 °C for about 5 min  Note that all above steps were processed in ambient air  The substrates were transferred to a N2 glove box after cooling down naturally to room temperature  Afterwards  a PCBM layer was spin-coated on the top of perovskite layer using a 20 mg/ml PCBM in chlorobenzene with 2000 rpm for 60 s Finally  100 nm patterned Ag electrode was thermally evaporated in vacuum of < 10− 6 Pa All the devices were tested in air condition with about 60 % humidity at 25 °C  22 Characterization of

223 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer ( FT-IR ) An FT-IR spectrometer ( VERTEX 70 ) was applied to characterize the functional groups of the single crystal perovskites  224 Photoluminescence ( PL ) The photoluminescence spectra of perovskites were collected from a Raman system with a fluorometer ( LabRAMHR800 )  225 Field emission scanning electron microscopy ( FESEM ) The morphology were analyzed by a scanning electron microscope ( SEM  FEI Sirion 200 )  226 UV–Vis spectrometer The UV–Vis absorption spectra were collected from a UV–Vis spectrometer ( Lambda 35 )  227 J–V

Series Source Meter under AM 15 solar simulator ( 100 mW cm− 2 ) which was calibrated by a standard single crystal Si solar cell  Electron trap density was tested by Keithley 2400 Series Source Meter under special device structure  All the tests were performed under ambient air environment  228 EQE spectraommercialization of PSCs  poor moisture stability is another severe issue to be solved urgently because PSC stability and performance are very sensitive to ambient air  Therefore  the manufacture of high-performance state-of-the-art PSCs is always processed in inert gases  Photovoltaic performance decays dramatically due to the air influence with the PCE of most air-processed perovskite solar cells < 15 %  and it is necessary to find effective ways to fabricate high-quality perovskite film with large grain and high air stabilityA Xe lamp with a filter wheel and a monochromator is applied to measure EQE spectra of the perovskite solar cells  229 The time-resolved

( x = 0  04  08 ) and CsPbBr3 were ground into powders to characterize their crystalline phase by X-ray diffraction ( XRD )  as shown in Figs  S1a  S2a and Fig  1a  b  respectively  When x = 0  obvious characteristic peaks such as ( 110 )  ( 112 )  ( 211 )  ( 202 )  ( 310 )  and ( 312 ) appeared in the XRD pattern  indicating that there were no other impurities in the single crystals of perovskites  which proved the single crystal of MAPbI3 of perovskite was synthesized [ 35 ]  The XRD spectra of MA1−xFAxPbI3 ( x = 04  08 ) powders have the planes of ( 110 ) and ( 220 ) [ 363738 ]  The XRD pattern of CsPbBr3 single crystal powders shows obvious characteristic peaks such as ( 020 )  ( 101 )  ( 121 )  ( 040 )  ( 202 )  ( 222 )  ( 321 )  ( 123 )  ( 242 )  ( 161 )  and ( 204 )  indicating that the CsPbBr3 single crystal has been synthesized [ 39  40 ]  To confirm the existence of HC ( NH2 ) 2+ in the MA1−xFAxPbI3 ( x = 0  04  08 ) perovskites  Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FT-IR ) of MA1−xFAxPbI3 ( x = 0  04  08 ) powders are shown in Figs  S1b  S2b and Fig  1c  respectively  Characteristic peak of the C=N vibration occurs 1714 cm− 1 in MA1−xFAxPbI3 ( x = 04  08 ) powders which is in agreement with the result of Fig  S2b and Fig  1c [ 38 ]  Thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) of CsPbBr3 and MA1−xFAxPbI3 ( x = 0  04  08 ) powdered samples are shown in Fig  1d  Figs  S1e  S2e  The crystal melts at 567 °C which indicates that CsPbBr3 single crystal is resistant to high temperature [ 34 ]  The TGA curves of MA1−xFAxPbI3 ( x = 0  04  08 ) suggest that those single crystal perovskites are thermally stable in 300 °C  313 °C and 323 °C  When the temperature raises to ~ 400 °C  a mass loss ( 26 %  22 %  13 % ) occurs in MA1−xFAxPbI3 ( x = 0  04  08 )  respectively  The decomposition temperature of the MA02FA08PbI3 single crystal is higher than MA1−xFAxPbI3 ( x = 0  04 )  which means that the thermal stability of MA02FA08PbI3 is better than MAPbI3 and MA06FA04PbI3High-performance PSCs have high crystalline quality of perovskite film with good surface morphology and large grain size  which depends on annealing process and precursor composition [ 41  42 ]  We have used the top-view scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) to compare the effect of conventional solution-mixing-based method ( calling “ Control ” for Figure ) with mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based method ( calling “ Single Crystal ” for Figure ) on perovskite crystallization  Fig  2a  b are the SEM images of ( MA1−xFAxPbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 ( x = 08 )  indicating that perovskite films fabricated by mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based method has higher quality with bigger grain size than that from conventional solution-mixing-based method  The statistical histogram of grain size observed from ( MA1−xFAxPbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 ( x = 08 ) films is shown in Fig  2  The average grain size is 236 nm and 135 nm for mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based and solution-mixing-based methods  respectively  And pinholes of the film prepared by mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based method at the grain boundaries are much less than in solution-mixing-based method  which suggests that mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based method can improve the grain size and enhance the crystal quality of perovskite film effectively  Fig  2The effect of phase and ambient stability on ( MA1−xFAxPbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 ( x = 0  04  08 ) films prepared by conventional solution-mixing-based and mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based methods is investigated  All the prepared films are kept in ambient environment with a relative humidity of around 60 %  Figures 3a  4a  S4 show the corresponding digital pictures of conventional solution-mixing-based and mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based ( MA1−xFAxPbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 ( x = 0  04  08 ) films at 0 day and 40 days in ambient environment  respectively  From the picture  we can observe that the color of conventional solution-mixing-based ( MA02FA08PbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 films changed from black into yellow while the phase of single crystal engineering-based films mostly remain black after 40 days  The mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based ( MA1−xFAxPbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 ( x = 08 ) films have the better ambient stability than mixed-cation single-crystal engineering based ( MA1−xFAxPbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 ( x = 0  04 )  Figure 3b  c illustrates the XRD patterns of ( MA1−xFAxPbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 ( x = 08 ) films which unravel the possible degradation rates of these films  The conventional solution-mixing-based films mostly degraded into PbI2 ( characteristic peaks at 127° ) after 40 days [ 43 ]  The typical peaks ( 2θ = 139° ) of ( MA1−xFAxPbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 ( x = 08 ) films and PbI2 peaks ( 2θ = 127° ) are observed  The peak ratio of I2θ=127°/I2θ=139° is used to calculate the relative degrading degree  while single crystal engineering-basedPbI2 peaks ( 2θ = 127° ) are observed  The peak ratio of I2θ=127°/I2θ=139° is used to calculate the relative degrading degree  while single crystal engineering-based ( MA02FA08PbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 films with a 22 % slower degradation rate than conventional solution mixing-based method  Meanwhile  the mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based ( MA02FA08PbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 films present less relative degrading degree than ( MA1−xFAxPbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 ( x = 0  04 ) films ( Figure 4b–d ) The UV–Vis spectra of degraded ( MA02FA08PbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 perovskite films which are recorded at 0 day and 40 days in ambient air are shown in Fig  3d  Fig  S1c and S2c show the corresponding UV–Vis spectra of MA1−xFAxPbI3 ( x = 0  04 )  The conventional solution-mixing-based ( MA02FA08PbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 films decompose into yellow phase after being stored for 40 days while single crystal engineering-based ( MA02FA08PbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 films show the much better ambient stability  Such observations prove that the mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based films can inhibit the entrance of moisture from the external environment into perovskite structure and improve ambient air stability effectively  Figure 3e shows the results of steady-state photoluminescence ( PL ) spectra of mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based and the conventional solution mixing-based ( MA02FA08PbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 films on ITO substrates ( a )  In addition  with the concentration increasing of FAPbI3  a small PL blue-shift can be observed in Figs  S1d  S2d  3e [ 38 ]  and Fig  S5 also shows PL blue-shift of CsPbBr3 ( a ) and MA1−xFAxPbI3 ( x = 0  04  08 ) ( b–d ) single crystal powders  respectively  It is obviously that the PL intensity of single crystal engineering-based film is much higher than counterpart  which means suppressed carrier recombination due to the reduced traps and defects within the perovskite film  indicating that mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based films have better quality  higher crystallinity  and fewer defects than the conventional solution mixing-based counterpart  Furthermore  electron-only devices with a structure of ITO/SnO2/Perovskite/PCBM/Ag were fabricated  which are used to analyze the charge transport of mixed-cation single crystals engineering-based and conventional solution mixing-based ( MA02FA08PbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 perovskite films through the electron trap state density  The defect density is calculated by the equation VTFL = entL2/2εε0  where VTFL is the applied voltage at the inflection point  e the elementary charge  L the thickness of the perovskite films  ε the relative dielectric constants  and the ε0 the vacuum permittivity [ 44 ]  Figure 3f and Figs  S1f and S2f show the current–voltage ( J–V ) curves of electron-only devices characterized in dark condition  A log–log representation of J–V curves can be observed in PSCs  In front of the inflection-point voltage  the current increases with the voltage linearly  indicating that an ohmic contact response with Ag electrode  Above the inflection-point voltage  the current increases sharply non-linearly when the traps are fully filled by the carriers  Therefore  the electron trap densities of ( MA02FA08PbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 perovskite films made by mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based and conventional solution mixing-based methods are 216 × 1015 cm− 3 and 276 × 1015 cm−3  respectively  The decrease in trap density suggests that mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based films have high quality and low trap densityThe inverted p–i–n planar device structure of ITO/NiO/Perovskite/PCBM/Ag is used to investigate the P V performance of mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based film of the ( MA1−xFAxPbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 ( x = 0  04  08 ) devices  The thickness of perovskite layer is about 500 nm as shown in Figs  5a–c  S3a  which display the J–V characteristics of ( MA1−xFAxPbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 ( x = 0  04  08 ) cells measured under AM 15G irradiation  Compared to conventional solution mixing-based PSCs  it is obvious that the parameters of JSC  VOC  FF and PCE increase in the mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based ones  The detailed cell parameters are summarized in Figs  5b  c  S3a  As the FA concentration increases  the PCE of ( MA1−xFAxPbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 ( x = 0  04  08 ) PSCs gradually increases from 1172 to 149 % with 10 M precursors concentration 10 M of mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based pervskite ( Table S1 )  We obtain the better solar cells by using 13 M concentration of ( MA1−xFAxPbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 ( x = 08 ) ; PSCs achieved a champion PCE of 1718 % ( VOC : 102 V  JSC : 238 mA cm−2  FF : 7085 ) and 1256 % ( VOC : 10 V  JSC : 194 mA cm−2FF : 6442 ) for mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based and the conventional solution mixing-based cells  respectively ( Fig  5b  c )  which means a 367 % increase in PCE by mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based ones  Such mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based films have better surface morphology  larger grain size  and lower trap density  leading to a higher VOC  JSC  FF and thus an enhanced PCE  These results reveal that mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based method plays a key role to gain high-performance PSCsFigure 5c describes the forward and reverse scans of the ( MA1−xFAxPbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 ( x = 08 ) PV cell  A negligible J–V hysteresis can be discovered in mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based cells  while the conventional solution mixing-based cell displays a larger hysteresis as shown in Fig  5b  High hysteresis may result from electron–hole recombination  trap defects and ion migration [ 141516 ]  Therefore  the negligible hysteresis in former may be attributed to the larger film coverage  better crystallinity  and the lower electron defect density of mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based films  Over 30 devices were fabricated to prove the reproducibility of PSCs and corresponding efficiency of histogram is illustrated in Fig  5d in which an average PCE of 145 % can be achieved  To further study the crystal engineering effect on the cell stability  Fig  5e shows the steady-state photocurrent efficiency of the mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based cell  The stabilized current density and PCE are stabilized at 23 mA cm− 2 and 171 % and the maximum power point is 083 V which matches to the device performance parameters in Table S1  Figure 5f shows the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra of ( MA02FA08PbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 devices fabricated by mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based and conventional solution mixing-based methods  A plateau of over 85 % EQE can be clearly observed in mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based devices  but the EQE value of the conventional solution mixing-based devices is lower than 80 % over the most ultraviolet–visible range ( 300–850 nm )  A higher EQE reveals a higher photo-to-current conversion so it leads to a larger short-circuit current density JSC  which is agreement with the value of J–V curvesAmbient stability of perovskite solar cells is very important for practical applications  Further experiments are carried out to further understand the effect of mixed cation-based single crystal engineering on ambient air stability of perovskite  Figure S4 shows the digital picture of ( MA1−xFAxPbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 ( x = 0  04  08 ) films fabricated by mixed-cation single crystals engineering-based and conventional solution mixing-based methods  Better ambient stability of mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based films is clearly shown  We further explore the device stability of ( MA1 − xFAxPbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 with different FA/MA ratios ( x = 0  04  08 ) fabricated by single crystal-based method ( Fig  S3b )  Eighty-six percentof the initial performance is retained for single crystal ( MA1−xFAxPbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 ( x = 08 ) devices after 30 days  while the PCE of single crystal ( MA1−xFAxPbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 ( x = 0  04 ) devices decreased to 83 % and 78 %  Then  we further explore the stability of ( MA1−xFAxPbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 ( x = 08 ) devices fabricated by mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based devices and conventional mixing method-based ones  respectively  Seventy-two percent of the initial performance was retained for mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based devices after 40 days  while the PCE of conventional solution mixing-based device decreases to 62 % and shows a much faster decomposition at the same storage time under a relative humidity of about 60 % at 25 °C ( Fig  6a )  In order to further explore the effect factors on stability of PSCs  time-resolved photoluminescence ( TRPL ) of mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based and conventional solution mixing-based ( MA1−xFAxPbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 ( x = 08 ) perovskites wasmeasured in Fig  6b  and the PL decay curves were fitted by a single exponential equation  The lifetime for mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based and conventional solution mixing-based ( MA1−xFAxPbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 ( x = 08 ) perovskite films are 4415 ns and 3239 ns  respectively  The lifetime of single crystal is much longer than counterpart ones  which indicates that the single crystal ( MA1−xFAxPbI3 ) 10 ( CsPbBr3 ) 005 ( x = 08 ) has lower recombination rates and trap concentration  and that is consistent with the charge transport measurements  We can conclude that mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based perovskite can improve stability of high-performance PSCs effectively due to longer lifetime and less defectsConclusions In conclusion  we develop a novel air-processed  mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based method to prepare organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite films with high crystallinity  large grain and low trap density  which highly enhances device air stability against moisture  We compare the influence of conventional molecule/ion solution mixing and mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based methods on the stability of PSCs for the first time  The perovskite films in single crystal engineering-based method have better surface morphology  less pinholes at the grain boundaries and larger grain size  which can reduce carrier recombination rate and traps density  In the optimal ratio of MA1−xFAxPbI3 and CsPbBr3  the PCE increased to 367 % from 1256 % for solution mixing-based cell and to 1717 % for mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based cell  owing to the larger JSC  VOC  FF and smaller hysteresis  In the ambient stability test of the cells  single crystal-based devices show better stability than the control solution mixing-based devices after 40 days  These results indicate the mixed-cation single crystal engineering-based perovskite films have better phase stability and can prevent perovskite degradation in long term  The findings in our work not only provide a facile way to fabricate ambient-stable high-performance PSCs in ambient air  but also provide a valuable insights into the key role of mixed-cation single crystals engineering in perovskite film formation in airSynthesis of SrCoO3 perovskite as W-based double perovskite and its structural propertiesAbstract The double-perovskites  ( AA′ ) ( BB′ ) O6  are gaining importance due to their flexibility in the choice of ions  and the wide application potential in magnetic  electrical  optical and thermal applications  Especially  the tungsten-based double-perovskites been explored for their optical properties  Hence  the double perovskite oxide  Sr2CoWO6  was synthesized using conventional solid-state reaction method  The Rietveld refinement data derived from powder X-ray diffraction pattern confirms the single-phase formation of Sr2CoWO6 compound  The deconvolution of Raman ’ s spectra exhibits first-order Raman ’ s modes of Sr2CoWO6  The observed phonon modes found to be in good agreement with the corresponding theoretical predictions for the space group of I4/m  The phosphor could be excited by the UV light region from 350 to 450 nm  and it exhibits blue ( 390 nm ) to 4A2 → 2T2 transition  The compound is stable with antiferromagnetic ordering  as evident from the magnetization loop and theoretical calculations  Band structure calculations for tetragonal Sr2CoWO6 predict an energy gap in both spin-up and spin-down configurationsIntroduction The focus on double-perovskite has gained importance due to their added advantage in terms of flexibility in the selection of ions [ 1  2 ]  The compounds with double-perovskite structure ( AA′ ) ( BB′ ) O6 are solid solutions of two perovskites : ABO3 and A′B′O3 [ 3 ]  In ( AA′ ) ( BB′ ) O6  A & A′ represents alkaline rare-earth ions or any large rare-earth ions  and B & B′ are often chosen to be transition metal ions or lanthanides of smaller ionic radii  The double-perovskite has the general formula A2 ( BB′ ) O6  if A and A′ are the same chemical element  These types of double-perovskites have received wide attention of researchers due to their unique electron transport  heat transfer  and magnetic properties  The tungstate oxides with double-perovskite structure ( A2BB′O6 ) have gained considerable attention over the past 2 decades  due to their interesting physical properties and extensive structural diversity  as well as possible applications in microwave dielectric ceramics  photocatalytic and luminescent materials [ 45678910 ]  Intense research directed towards the synthesis and structural characterization of numerous tungstate double-perovskites  which may crystallize in different type of lattices such as cubic  tetragonal  orthorhombic or even monoclinic  depending on the charge and ionic radii [ 111213141516 ]  There are reports for experimental determination of the electronic structure of these tungstate materials by using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and Raman ’ s spectroscopy [ 17  18 ]  and computational determination by density functional theory ( DFT ) [ 19 ]  Here  most of the reported materials are synthesized and studied in polycrystalline powder phases  The recent research is towards preparation of double-perovskites with the molecular formula of A2BB′O6 and optimize their properties  especially the electronic and magnetic transport phenomenon which lead-up to technological applications  In literature  the A2BB′O6 ( A = Ca  Sr  Ba ; B = Co  Cr  Fe ; B′ = Mo  W  Re ) compounds have been reported and the analogues of Sr2FeMoO6 compound have been systematically investigated [ 2021222324 ]  However  there are only few reports published for Sr2CoWO6 compound [ 25262728 ]  The aim of the present work is to analyze the structural  electron transport  optical and magnetic properties of Sr2CoWO6 compound  Furthermore  an attempt to compare the experimental values to theoretical values obtained through Density Functional Theory ( DFT ) is undertaken [ 28  29 ]  The results obtained from the characterizations are discussedSynthesis and characterization 21 Experimental analysis Polycrystalline powder of Sr2CoWO6 compound prepared by high-temperature solid-state reaction method  The Sr ( CO ) 3  CoO3 and WO3 ( 999 % ) were weighed and mixed by stoichiometric proportions  The initial mixture was well ground using an agate mortar and pestle for 2 h  and finally annealed at 1200 °C for 12 h in air atmosphere  Powder X-ray diffraction analysis carried out to determine the crystal structure of the sample using Powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu–Kα radiation ( XPERT-PRO )  The Rietveld refinement performed using FULLPROF program to determine the structural parameters  The diffused reflectance spectrum was recorded using UV–VIS–NIR spectrophotometer ( JASCO V-670 )  The Raman spectrum derived from the Renishaw system 2000 Raman ’ s imaging microscope having a 488 nm laser diode in the extended range of 100–2000 cm−1  The photoluminescence measurement taken at room temperature on a Fluorolog-3 Model FL3-221 Spectrofluorometer system  using a 450W Xenon lamp as the excitation source for emission measurements  The magnetization analysis at room temperature were carried out using the Lakeshore 7410 vibrating sample magnetometer ( VSM ) with a maximum applied field of 15 kOe  22 Computational analysis The ab-initio calculation performed according to density functional theory ( DFT ) and density functional perturbation theory ( DFPT ) by Projector Augmented Wave ( PAW ) method [ 30 ]  as implemented in VASP [ 31 ]  The exchange correlation ( XC ) function based on the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof ( PBE ) version of the generalized gradient approximation GGA [ 32 ]  The lattice parameters and the atomic positions obtained from the Rietveld refinement used as the input for DFT calculations  reduced to within 001 eV/Å and then the structure was fully relaxed for the Hellmann–Feynman forces on each atom [ 333435 ]  3 Results and discussion 31 Powder X-ray diffraction analysis The powder X-ray diffraction data at the room temperature reveals the single-phase nature of the sample with no detectable secondary phases ( as reported for the some chemical wet routes and solid-state reaction routes ) [ 26  36 ]  The peaks around 19° and 38° are the superstructure reflections indicating the B site Co/W ordering [ 16 ]  The powder X-ray diffraction pattern of the Sr2CoWO6 compound shown in Fig  1  for which the Rietveld refinement is performed to analyze the phase purity and crystal structure of the compound  The values of global R factors were obtained to be Rp = 636 %  Rwp = 981 %  Rexp = 238 %  and χ2 = 123  from the Rietveld refinement  The residual factors indicate a reasonable fit between the calculated and experimental pattern  The Sr2CoWO6 forms a tetragonal structure having I4/m spacegroup  The absence of any secondary major secondary phase indicates the incorporation of W ions in to the SrCoO3 structure  The structural parameters  bond angles and bond distances obtained from Rietveld refinement listed in Table 1 are in good agreement with the earlier reports [ 37 ]  The visualized crystal structure of Sr2CoWO6 compound  shown in Fig  2  using VESTA ( Visualization for Electronic and Structural Analysis ) software  2 Structural property The prepared Sr2CoWO6 compound crystallized into tetragonal structure having I4/m space group  which parameters used as initial value for the theoretical calculations  The total energy calculation carried out by considering the Anti-ferromagnetic ( AFM ) ordering of spin polarization for the Sr2CoWO6 compound  The work reported by Tayebehsadat et al  [ 38 ] concluded that AFM ordering is more stable than other ferromagnetic ( FM ) and non-magnetic ( NM ) phases  which serves as a theoretical confirmation  The lattice parameters derived using the computational method is found to be a = b = 5413 Å and c = 8427 Å  Henceforth  the structural parameters obtained from theoretical calculations match well with experimental values ( parameters derived from Rietveld Analysis )  as listed in Table 1  33 UV DRS Spectroscopy The diffused reflectance spectrum of the Sr2CoWO6 compound at room temperature in the range 250–850 nm  shown in Fig  3  The strong and flat absorption bands observed in the UV region attributed towards the O2p to W5d Charge transfer band ( CTB ) structureFrom the Kubelka–Munk ( KM ) function  where F ( R ) is proportional to the extinction co-efficient  and R is the reflectance  the data obtained can be converted to absorption data [ 39  40 ]  Then a plot is drawn between the versus to determine the band gap energy of the material  as shown in the inset of Fig  3  The value of the experimental band gap of Sr2CoWO6 compound from the fitting obtained from the curve is 238 eV  The excitation from the O2p to W5d in the ( WO4 ) 2− group absorbs ultraviolet irradiation in Sr2CoWO6  In the excited state of the ( WO4 ) 2− groups  the excitons are created due to the hole ( on the oxygen )  and the electron ( on the tungsten ) resulting due to the strong interaction  In the Sr2CoWO6 compound  the observed absorption peaks can be attributed to the transitions from 4A2 to 4T2 ( 470–600 nm )  which match well with the excitation spectra  34 Electronic property The electronic band structure calculation carried out for the Sr2CoWO6 compound with the integration of AFM magnetic ordering at room temperature  The calculation performed by assuming the collinear spin alignment  A strong electron correlation effect is expected for a 3d-transition metal ion having strongly correlated electronic system with the partially filled d-band  The calculated spin polarized total density of states and partial density of states of Sr2CoWO6 compound  shown in Fig  4  The energy states around Fermi ’ s level ( EF ) are mainly formed by the hybridization of 3d states of Co  5d states of W  and 2p states of O atoms  which demonstrates the existence of the band gap in the compound  The band gap ( Eg ) value of 185 eV derived from the theoretical calculation is close to the experimental bandgap determined from the diffused reflectance study [ 38 ]  Fig  45 Raman spectroscopic analysis Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique for characterizing the lattice-vibration properties  probing not only the spin-phonon interaction but also accounts for the electron–phonon interaction  Hence  this technique is much effective for characterizing the double perovskite structured compounds  The Fig  5 shows the low-frequency Raman spectra of the Sr2CoWO6 samples  According to the powder X-Ray diffraction analysis  the double perovskite Sr2CoWO6 compound has tetragonal symmetry with the I4/m space group  From the group theory  selection rules for the Raman active mode of tetragonal structure refined with the total number of normal Raman ’ s modes gives  Fig  5The resulting factor-group analysis indicates that four modes ( Ag  Bg  Eg ) are Raman-active for the Sr2CoWO6 compound  the values are listed in Table 2 [ 41 ]  Since all these modes fall in the frequency range below ~ 900 cm−1  most of the Raman studies have been focused in this region [ 37 ]  The interpretation of Raman ’ s spectrum reveals that the Sr2CoWO6 compound exhibits a larger number of features than the four dominating Raman-active modes  On decomposing the curves into individual Lorentzian components  the peak position of each component observed are termed as the natural frequency ( cm− 1 ) of Raman active mode of Sr2CoWO6 compound  shown in Figs  5 and 6Therefore  the vibration bands reported for various compounds of double perovskite family taken as reference for the analysis of Raman ’ s spectrum of Sr2CoWO6 compound  The main features observed in the spectrum at room temperature are the three resonance bands centered around 850 cm−1  The observed Raman modes agree with the earlier reports of tetragonal structured Sr2CoWO6 compound [ 38 ]  The Raman spectra measured in the extended range of 1000–2000 cm−1 exhibit a prominent band in the range  which can be associated with two phonon Raman Spectroscopy  Generally  the origin of the high-frequency modes in the Raman spectra is attributed to electronic Raman scattering or the higher-order phonon scattering  due to the resonance with the intrinsic absorption edge [ 424344 ]  The four broad bands appearing between 1000–1700 cm−1 in the higher-order Raman measurements labeled as 2E8  2E9  2B1 and 2B2 since they appear at double-energy values of A4  E8 and E9 in normal Raman ’ s spectra of double-perovskite compounds  The presence of two phonon modes may be associated with the strong spin–lattice coupling arising from the interaction between the adjacent magnetic sub lattices [ 45 ]  This may be due to the presence of antiferromagnetic ordering  as observed in BiFeO3 with appearance of higher-order phonon Raman bands [ 454647 ]  36 Phonon property analysis The phonon dispersion curve along high symmetry direction  total and partial density of states of the compound is given in Fig  7  The small quantity of negative frequency at point indicates the metastable phase  The theoretical phonon dispersion peaks are in good agreement with experimental Raman spectrum  as listed in Table 3  The phonon dispersion curves exhibit two distinct frequency regions  such as ( i ) the low frequency region composed of both acoustic and optical modes in the range of 0 Hz to 14 THz ( 477 cm−1 )  and ( ii ) the upper frequency region of nearly 18 THz ( 605 cm−1 ) to nearly 25 THz ( 800 cm−1 )  In the lower frequency region  mainly the Sr and W atoms contributed the peaks of 4 THz and 5 THz  In the middle frequency  the Co and O atoms contribute in the region of 66 THz to 96 THz  The higher-frequency region  the oxygen atom contributed the 18 THz to 25 THz region  The distinct region of the band gap observed due to larger mass differences between the Sr  Co  W  and O atomsThe crystal structure of Sr2CoWO6 compound is refined with the space group I4/m and point group of ( C4h5 )  with two molecular formula ( Z = 2 ) per unit cell  The primitive cell contains 10 atoms  where each atom has three degrees of freedom  Hence  30 modes of vibration obtained are classified as M = 3Ag + 5Au + 3Bg + Bu + 31Eg + 61Eu + 32Eg + 62Eu  There is 21 first order or lower vibration modes ( 3Ag + 5Au + 3Bg + Bu + 3 1Eg + 6 1Eu ) and 9 s-order vibration modes ( 3 2Eg + 6 2Eu ) were present  The observed vibration modes divided into two branches  such as acoustical and optical  For the acoustical branch  three modes of vibrations are present and given as  For the optical branch  27 modes of vibrations are present and are given as  In general  there are 9 Raman-active modes ( 3Ag + 3Bg + 3Eg ) and 9 IR-active modes ( 4Au + 5Eu ) are obtained in first order or lower frequency region of the compound  In particular  Raman active modes and IR active modes in partial atom are presented in Table 2  The Raman active modes of Bg  Eg  2Eg  Ag  1Eg  2Eg  2Ag  2Bg  1Eg  and 2Eg are observed mainly from Sr and O atoms  The IR active modes of Au  1Eu  and 2Eu observed for all atoms  37 Magnetic properties The room-temperature magnetization behavior of the Sr2CoWO6 compound is shown in Fig  8  The linear dependence of magnetization with respect to the applied magnetic field indicates the presence of antiferromagnetic ordering in the sample  The values of magnetic remanence and coercive field are obtained from the curve  whereas there is no saturation magnetization observed  The magnetization remains unsaturated for the highest applied field ( H = 15 kOe ) and such behavior has been attributed to a high degree of spin disorder [ 48 ]  Hence  the magnetization value at the maximum applied magnetic field is being considered as the saturation magnetization [ 26  27 ]  The magnetization parameters such as remanence ( MR )  saturation ( MS ) and coercivity ( HC ) calculated from the M–H curve are listed in Table 4  The magneto-crystalline anisotropy constant ( K ) and Bohr magneton ( µB ) were also calculated using the following equations [ 49 ]  8 Photoluminescence The tungstate double perovskite is a class of self-luminescent material  which emits blue–green spectral region due to annihilation of self-trapped exciton in ( WO6 ) 6− octahedral complex [ 50 ]  The Sr2CoWO6 compound was excited at 390 nm  which exhibits a broad-emission band with peak in the green region ( 590 nm )  shown in Fig  9 [ 515253 ]  The Photoluminescence excitation spectra obtained at 390 nm consist of a broad band  referred to charge transfer band  According to the band structure and density of state analysis  the top of the valence band is dominated by Op orbital  and the Wd orbital is the main contributor to the bottom of the conduction band  Therefore  the broad excitation band is attributed due to the charge transfer process of an Op electron going into the empty Wd orbital [ 54  55 ]  In the longer wavelength region ( inset of Fig  9 )  the blue-green component of the broad-emission band is mainly attributed to transition from excited state 2T2 to ground state 4A2 of ( WO6 ) 6− complex [ 56  57 ] From the peaks of photoluminescence emission  the band gap energy was calculated as Eg = 210 eV [ Ref 58 Removed ]  The schematic energy level diagram  shown in Fig  10  for the optical transitions between O2−–W6+ host and the emission from 4T2 to 4A2  The 5d–3d emission of Sr2CoWO6 phosphor depends strongly on the crystal field  and thus emission wavelength is very sensitive to the crystallographic environment  The luminescence blue bands at 490 nm are due to transition vacancy of regular oxygen and interstitial oxygen  The green emission at 590 nm referred to a deep level emission usually caused by the presence of ionized oxygen vacancy on the surface and results from the recombination of a photo-generated hole with a single ionized charged state of the defects in the prepared compoundConclusion The double perovskite oxide  Sr2CoWO6  has been successfully synthesized using conventional solid-state reaction method  The Rietveld refinement data confirms the formation of single-phase Sr2CoWO6 compound  The deconvolution of Raman ’ s spectra of Sr2CoWO6 compound provides the structural confirmation as the appearance of first-order Raman ’ s modes  The evidence of antiferromagnetic interactions is determined through the magnetic hysteresis and theoretical calculations  The phosphor can be excited by the UV light region from 350 to 450 nm and exhibits a blue emission at 390 nm due to transition from 4A2 to 2T2  The excitation photoluminescence spectra displayed broad bands between 380 and 400 nm  which assigned to the charge transfer band of Sr2CoWO6  Hence  the prepared compound displays photoluminescence in the near-UV and visible region  which makes the compound a

bonding INTRODUCTION Organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) are receiving increasing attention owing to their lower recombination rate  stronger light absorption  ambipolar charge transport  and long carrier diffusion length1–5 After the advancement of scientific research in this area  the certified power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of planar PSCs has exceeded 252 % 6–13 In planar PSCs  TiO2 is widely used as an electron collecting and transporting material owing to the good match of its bandgap and good photoelectrochemical stability1415 However  defects at the dense blocking TiO2 ( bl-TiO2 ) /MAPbI3 interface lead to low electron extraction capability and charge separation  resulting in a degradation of the open-circuit voltage ( Voc )  To address this problem  interface modifiers have been introduced  and research has shown that such interface modification is one of the effective methods to optimize the performance of PSCs1216–18 Recently  perovskite-type oxides have been widely used to modify the interface in PSCs  including SrTiO3  CaTiO3  and MgTiO3  etc19–21 These oxides can separate the injected electrons from the redox couple  thereby suppressing charge recombination  BaTiO3  as a member of the perovskite-type oxidesexhibits more favorable energy level alignment with TiO2 and MAPbI3  providing an opportunity to reduce the deep trap states and energy loss ; this is the origin of our research idea and impetus  In the field of planar PSCs  we consider that it is important to study the effects of modification of the bl-TiO2/ MAPbI3 interface by BaTiO3 on the performance of PSCs  In the work presented herein  BaTiO3 nanocrystals were prepared by immersing dense blocking TiO2 ( bl-TiO2 ) in barium nitrate solution to study the influence of the number of deposition cycles on the photovoltaic performance of planar PSCs  In this process  Ba2+ was combined with the upper bl-TiO2 layer and formed Ba ( OH ) 2  After annealing at 550C  BaTiO3 nanocrystals were obtained  The crystalline structure of BaTiO3 is consistent with that of MAPbI3  with a titanium ion lying at the center of a polyhedron composed of oxygen ions and a barium ion at the center of the interstitial space surrounded by eight oxygen tetrahedron22–24 Therefore  BaTiO3 nanocrystals can be thought of as seed crystals for MAPbI3  which may contribute to rapid nucleation and growth of the upper MAPbI3 layer  After introducing the BaTiO3 modifier  the size of the MAPbI3 grains was increased while fewer grain boundaries were observed  Meanwhile  the introduction of BaTiO3 nanocrystals also effectively boosted the electron extraction rate and suppressed the carrier recombination at the interface  As a result  the MAPbI3 layer exhibited superior absorption ability  It is worth mentioning that BaTiO3 is a low-conductivity electrolyte material  which can prevent injection of electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 and reduce the carrier recombination  so as to increase Voc and the fill factor ( FF )  By treating the bl-TiO2 layer with BaTiO3 nanocrystals  the TiO2/MAPbI3 interface and the photovoltaic performance were improved  The maximum PCE of the device was thereby enhanced to 177 %  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials Fluorine-doped tin oxide ( FTO  SnO2  7 X/square ) was purchased from Wuhan Geao Science & Education Instrument Co  Ltd Zinc powder ( Zn  analytically pure )  hydrochloric acid ( HCl  analytically pure )  and titanium ( IV ) chloride ( TiCl4  analytically pure ) were bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co  Ltd Other materials  including lead ( II ) iodide ( PbI2  purity 98 % )  methylammonium iodide ( MAI  CH3NH3I  purity 98 % )  N  N-dimethylformamide ( DMF  ACS grade )  dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO  ACS

trifluoromethane ) sulfonimide lithium salt ( LiTFSI  98 % purity )  were purchased from Aladdin Ltd  Preparation of BaTiO3 Nanocrystals Bl-TiO2 films were immersed in low-concentration Ba ( NO3 ) 2 solution for 30 s Following immersion  the samples were rinsed with deionized water and dried  The above process represents one cycle ( 1c )  The procedure was repeated for 0c  2c  4c  or 6c to determine the optimum treatment condition  Finally  the devices were annealed at 550C for 30 min in a high-temperature muffle furnace and taken out after cooling down  Cell Fabrication Firstly  FTO substrates were washed with deionized water  ethanol  acetone  and 2-propanol  then dried in air  Then  the cleaned FTO was immersed in 200 mmol/L TiCl4 aqueous solution and kept at 70C for 1 h25–27 followed by washing with deionized water and ethanol  Finally  bl-TiO2 was obtained by annealing at 450C for 30 min in a muffle furnace  To study whether the interface modification had a positive effect on optimizing the photovoltaic performance of the planar PSCs  0c  2c  4c  and 6c of BaTiO3 were prepared on bl-TiO2 substrates  The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on top of the prepared bl-TiO2 layer at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 6000 rpm for 55 s using DMF-DMSO ( 4:6  v/v ) containing 530 mg/ml PbI2 and 183 mg/ml MAI  During the second spin-coating step  after 25 s of spin-coating at 6000 rpm  750 lL chlorobenzene was quickly dropped onto the center of the spinning substrate  followed by annealing at 100C for 15 min on a hotplate28 The hole transport layer was spin-coated on top of the MAPbI3 layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s using chlorobenzene solution containing 723 mg/ml spiro-MeOTAD and 29 lL/ ml 4-tert-butylpyridine  as well as 18 lL/ml lithium bisimide solution2930 Finally  a 100-nm Ag backelectrode was deposited by thermal evaporation  Characterization x-Ray diffraction ( XRD ) patterns were obtained using a SmartLab device with Cu Ka radiation ( k = 15418A˚ )  Current density–voltage ( J–V ) curves of the PSCs were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter with a solar light simulator ( 500- W xenon lamp  Spectra Physics )  The valence states of the constituent elements were identified by highresolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS )  The percentages of Ti  Ba  and O in the film were verified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry  The materials were observed in detail by gigh-resolution transmission electron microscopy ( HRTEM  JEM-2100F ; JEOL )  Ultraviolet–visible ( UV–Vis ) absorbance spectra were recorded on a UV 3500 double-beam spectrophotometer  Surface images of the cells were obtained by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM  Magellan 400 ; FEI ) and corresponding energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy ( EDX )  Stable photoluminescence spectra ( PL ) were 4602 X Zhang  J Zhang  Su  Feng  Xu  Bian  Fu  Yang  and Li recorded using a fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation laser with wavelength of 473 nm  Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy ( UPS ) measurements were performed using a ThermoFischer ESCALAB 250Xi instrument  The UPS radiation was generated by a He-gas discharge lamp ( He Ia at 2122 eV )  Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS ) measurements were carried out using a Solartron 1260 impedance analyzer at a bias of 01 V and sweeping the frequency from 1 MHz to 01 Hz  The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) was acquired using a Test Station 1000 A ( CROWNTECH  INC )  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Figure 1a shows the FTO/bl-TiO2/BaTiO3/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag cell structure  A crosssectional SEM image of the cell is shown in Fig  1b  where the thickness of the bl-TiO2 layer and perovskite layer are about 50 nm and 300 nm  respectively  However  the BaTiO3 is too thin to be observed  Since the BaTiO3 nanocrystals were obtained by immersing FTO/bl-TiO2 in low-concentration Ba ( NO3 ) 2 solution  they could not be detected by XRD analysis of the FTO substrates  Figure 2a shows the XRD patterns of high-temperature-annealed TiO2 powder obtained by water bathing TiCl4 and immersing annealed TiO2 powder in Ba ( NO3 ) 2 solution  Here  the diffraction pattern of TiO2 treated with Ba ( NO3 ) 2 solution shows two weak peaks compared with the pattern of bl-TiO2  which correspond to BaTiO3 and are located at 315 and 389  respectively  These results show that BaTiO3 can be prepared on the bl-TiO2 layer using this method  Typical high-resolution transmission electron microscopy ( HRTEM ) and scanning transmission electron microscopy ( STEM ) images of BaTiO3 nanoparticles are shown in Supplementary Fig  S1 ( Supplementary Electronic Material )  To reveal the effects of Ba2+ on bl-TiO2  the XPS spectra for the bi-TiO2/BaTiO3 films are shown in Fig  2b  In Fig  2c  the Ti 2p peak obtained from the surface of bl-TiO2 is shifted to higher energy by about 70 meV  This can be attributed to the difference in electronegativity between titanium and barium atoms  The electronegativity value of Ti is 154 while that of Ba is 089  indicating negative charge transfer toward atoms in the Ti–O–Ba bond and thereby reducing the Ti 2p core-level binding energy  As shown in Fig  2d  the binding energy peaks at about 7801 eV and 7954 eV correspond respectively to Ba 3d5/2 and Ba 3d3/2 of BaTiO3  suggesting that BaTiO3 nanocrystals were successfully attached to bl-TiO2  The O : Ba : Ti stoichiometric ratio obtained from XPS analysis is 5521:437:4045  being similar to that of 6165:367:3468 obtained from energy-dispersive x-ray ( EDX ) measurements ( Supplementary Fig  S2 )  To accurately determine the position of the energy band  UPS characterization of bl-TiO2 and bl-TiO2/ BaTiO3 ( 4c ) is shown in Supplementary Fig  S3  Figure 3a depicts the secondary-electron cutoff region for the material  The contact potential ( u = 2122 – E ) cutoff for bl-TiO2 and bl-TiO2/ BaTiO3 ( 4c ) was estimated as 485 eV and 466 eV  respectively  The distance between the valenceband maximum ( VBM ) and Fermi level ( Ef ) was about 238 eV and 245 eV for bl-TiO2 and bl-TiO2/ BaTiO3 ( 4c ) ( Fig  3b )  Therefore  the position of the VBM of bl-TiO2 and bl-TiO2/BaTiO3 ( 4c ) was 723 eV and 708 eV  respectively  According to Fig  3c  the calculated bandgap of the bl-TiO2 and bl-TiO2/ BaTiO3 ( 4c ) film was around 320 eV and 323 eV  Thus  the calculated conduction-band minimum ( CBM ) is 403 eV and 388 eV ( Fig  3c ) for bl-TiO2 and bl-TiO2/BaTiO3 ( 4c )  It has been reported that an up-shifted Fermi level can significantly increase the free electron density and decrease the deep trap states below the conduction band  thereby enhancing the charge transport ability31–35 The elevated CBM is beneficial to achieve more favorable energy level alignment between the CBM of the TiO2 electron transport layer ( ETL ) and the perovskite layer  This reduces energy loss and boosts the electron extraction rate without inducing excessive interface recombinationFigure 4a–d shows SEM images of MAPbI3 films based on BaTiO3 nanocrystals ( 0  2c  4c  and 6c )  With the formation of BaTiO3 between bl-TiO2 and perovskite  the size of the film of perovskite crystals was increased  which could benefit the charge transportation in perovskite active layers  Larger grain sizes and smaller grain boundaries were found by SEM  consistent with the higher FF  SEM images of bl-TiO2 and bl-TiO2/Ba ( NO3 ) 2 are shown in Supplementary Fig  S4  Although the morphological changes of bl-TiO2 and bl-TiO2/ Ba ( NO3 ) 2 can not be directly observed from crosssectional images  note that the nanoparticles on blTiO2/Ba ( NO3 ) 2 appear more dispersed from the topview images  This means that the BaTiO3 layer on the surface of the bl-TiO2 layer helped the nanocrystals to become more convex to maintain full contact with the MAPbI3 solution and thus obtain a fully filled  high-quality MAPbI3 layer  The crystalline quality of the perovskite films has a strong impact on the ultimate performance of the PSC  Thus  we measured the XRD patterns of MAPbI3 filmsdeposited on bl-TiO2  bl-TiO2/BaTiO3 ( 2c )  bl-TiO2/ BaTiO3 ( 4c )  and bl-TiO2/BaTiO3 ( 6c ) ( Fig  4e )  The main diffraction peaks  located at about 1414  1994  2361  245  284  3186  3495  4045  and 4303  correspond to ( 110 )  ( 112 )  ( 211 )  ( 202 )  ( 220 )  ( 310 )  ( 312 )  ( 224 )  and ( 314 ) crystal planes of the perovskite crystal structure  Obviously  the MAPbI3 film on bl-TiO2/BaTiO3 ( 4c ) showed diffraction peaks with stronger intensity and smaller fullwidth of half-maximum  indicating better crystallinity of MAPbI3  The modification of TiO2 by BaTiO3 thus facilitated an increase in the grain size of the perovskite film  resulting in the enhanced diffraction signal  The J–V curves of planar PSCs based on TiO2/ BaTiO3 with different numbers of BaTiO3 deposition cycles are shown in Fig  5a  The PCE increased with increasing number of deposition cycles of BaTiO3 nanocrystals at first  When the number of deposition cycles of BaTiO3 nanocrystals was increased to four  the planar PSCs based on TiO2/ BaTiO3 ( 4c ) showed the highest PCE  At the sametime  with increasing number of deposition cycles of BaTiO3 nanocrystals  the Jsc was reduced because the BaTiO3 nanocrystals are a dielectric material that hinders electron transport  Nevertheless  this undesirable effect could be ignored when the number of deposition cycles was less than four  To compare two types of devices effectively  we investigated the hysteresis of cells fabricated using different numbers of deposition cycles ( Fig  5b )  The photovoltaic parameters of the devices obtained under two conditions are presented in Table I  The PCE difference between the reverse and forward scans decreased with increasing number of deposition cycles  For the planar PSCs based on TiO2  this difference was 20 %  whereas a difference of only 66 % was observed for the planar PSCs based on TiO2/BaTiO3 ( 4c ) ( Table I )  These change mainly occur due to the variation of the FF  which can be reduced by interface modification  To provide deeper insight into the variation of the photovoltaic performance  the UV–Vis absorption spectra of bl-TiO2 and bl-TiO2/BaTiO3 ( 4c ) are shown in Fig  5c  The absorption curve of bl-TiO2/ BaTiO3 almost overlaps with that of TiO2  Therefore  the light-harvesting layer is capable of collecting most of the light  In addition  Fig  5d shows the UV–Vis absorption spectra of bl-TiO2/MAPbI3 and bl-TiO2/BaTiO3 ( 4c ) /MAPbI3  It can be seen from this figure that the absorption by the MAPbI3 layer deposited on bl-TiO2/BaTiO3 ( 4c ) was greater than that on bl-TiO2  indicating the MAPbI3 deposited on bl-TiO2/BaTiO3 ( 4c ) exhibited strong light-harvesting capabilityFor in-depth understanding of the photovoltaic performance  the photovoltaic parameters of the best cell chose from among 15 for each condition are presented in Table II  Furthermore  Fig  6 shows the statistical results for the photovoltaic parameters of the 15 cells for each condition  This analysreveals that the photovoltaic performance of the cells was improved after modification of the interface using BaTiO3 nanocrystals  Finally  the best PCE of the PSCs was increased to 1503 %  When increasing the number of deposition cycles  both Jsc and FF showed a tendency to increase first then gradually decrease  while Voc remained almost at the maximum value after four cycles of BaTiO3 nanocrystal deposition  Therefore  the best PCE of 1771 % ( with Jsc = 2249 mA/cm2  Voc = 112 V  and FF = 70 % ) was obtained based on bl-TiO2/BaTiO3 ( 4c )  Figure 7a shows the EQE spectra of the bl-TiO2 and bl-TiO2/BaTiO3 ( 4c ) devices  The EQE of the best cell employing bl-TiO2 and bl-TiO2/BaTiO3 ( 4c ) demonstrated a clear onset of photocurrent generation at 780 nm  fitting well with the bandgap of MAPbI3  Compared with the bl-TiO2 device  the blTiO2/BaTiO3 ( 4c ) device showed stronger EQE values  indicating that the devices deposited on blTiO2/BaTiO3 ( 4c ) exhibited more efficient electron extraction capability34 To further study the charge recombination at the ETL–perovskite interface  Fig  7b shows EIS measurements performed at a bias of 01 V We used a circuit model consisting of parallel recombination resistance ( Rrec ) /chemical capacitance ( CPE ) elements  connected in series with a series resistance ( Rs ) to obtain a good fit to the experimental data ; the resistance results obtained from the fitting are presented in Supplementary Table S5  The arc is related to interfacial recombination at the ETL– perovskite interface  reflecting the charge recombination resistance Rrec  The larger the semicircle of the arc  the greater the value of Rrec  The PSC with bl-TiO2/BaTiO3 ( 4c ) exhibited larger Rrec than the pristine bl-TiO2-based cells  indicating less carrier recombination  PL measurements were conducted to investigate the charge transfer kinetics  Figure 7c shows the PL spectra of the perovskite deposited on bl-TiO2 and bl-TiO2/BaTiO3 ( 4c )  The MAPbI3 layer deposited on the bl-TiO2/BaTiO3 ( 4c ) substrate showed the lowest PL peak  The corresponding time-resolved PL ( TRPL ) decay spectra are shown in Fig  7d  fit using a single-exponential decay function  The results reveal that perovskite films with bl-TiO2/BaTiO3 ( 4c ) displayed shorter TRPL lifetime  indicatingCONCLUSIONS Perovskite-type BaTiO3 nanocrystals were introduced as an interfacial modifier in the bl-TiO2/ MAPbI3 interface  The results demonstrated that the BaTiO3 showed more favorable energy level alignment with TiO2 and MAPbI3  which is beneficial to reduce the deep trap states and energy loss at the interface  By optimizing the bl-TiO2/MAPbI3 interface  the best device showed a PCE of 1771 %  higher than the value of 1671 % for the pristine device  Moreover  the bl-TiO2/BaTiO3 ( 4c ) layer exhibited a stronger electron collection ability  more efficacious carrier separation  and less carrier recombination in comparison with the pristine blTiO2  Interfacial defects were reduced due to the improved match at the interface between the perovskite-type BaTiO3 nanocrystals and MAPbI3 layer  Such application of BaTiO3 nanocrystals for interfacial modification is thus an effective method for optimizing the performance of planar PSC devicesEfficient Design of Perovskite Solar Cell Using Parametric Grading of

cost-effectiveness as compared to the general Si-based solar cell technologies  The journey of PSC has been commendable as it started with 38 % efficiency in 2009 and landed with a higher efficiency of 227 % in 20171 The photovoltaic cells are highly competitive with the existing methodologies  but still have certain disadvantages as compared to the inorganic solar cells  Methyl ammonium lead iodide is the most preferred perovskite material because of its wide absorption range covering a large area in the visible spectrum as well2 A comprehensive analysis of data is reported by many researchers for the same  A conventional planar structure PSC consists of an absorber layer  sandwiched between an electron transport layer ( ETL ) and a hole transport layer ( HTL )  The most critical absorber layer comprises perovskite material3 A careful choice of these constituents decides the overall performance of all the devices  There are various organic and inorganic materials available to design a PSC  Copper iodide ( CuI )  Cu2O  NiOx  spiro-MeOTAD  etc  are some efficient hole transport materials ( HTMs )  Similarly  electron transport materials such as ZnO  TiO2  SnO2are most commonly used in cell formation  Planar PSCs closely resemble thin film technologies  PSCs are primarily composed of p- and n-type semiconducting materials  Recent advances in ETL incorporated stable PSCs based on TiO2 by presenting pyrene derivatives  which are corrosion free in HTMs4 However  the drawbacks of TiO2 such as activation of surface traps due to the oxygen ( Received May 2  2018 ; accepted August 22  2018 ; vacancy  TiO2 degradation under UV illumination  and photocatalytic properties of TiO2 degrade the functionality of PSCs56 This suggests the need to introduce a non-oxide compound to be used as ETL  Metal sulfides have been efficient in matching the absorber layer and fluorine-doped tin oxide ( FTO ) layer energy levels  but could not beat the real achievements78 CdZnS compound has a wide bandgap ranging from 240 eV to 316 eV under variable composition of Zn in the compound9 A potent blend of ETL  HTL  and mixed halide perovskite as an absorber has gained high popularity with its tremendous performance  The derivative halide associated with the perovskite material is possibly Cl or bromine ions  Mixed halide composition of perovskite with Cl as a derivative halide ( CH3NH3PbI3XClX ) is characterized by its high charge generation and collection as it exhibits excellent diffusion lengths greater than 1 lm10 whereas the incorporation of bromine is less efficient but exhibits stability  The study is mainly focused on CH3NH3PbI3XClX as a mixed halide perovskite  Conscientious choices of material and its parameters to be used in the device simulation is the key ingredient to the process of highly efficient device formation  The general choice of HTMs and electron transport materials ( ETMs ) is characterized by their charge carrier mobility  ease of fabrication  conductivity  durability  accessibility  stability  etc3 The perovskite cells emerge from the dye-sensitized solar cells where the perovskite replaced the little dye in the first place  This amendment enables higher carrier mobility  long lifespan  and concentration density in the transport layer of the solar cells  The most widely used HTM spiro-MeOTAD is organic  The presence of TBP ( 4-tert-Butylpyridine ) and Li-TFSI ( Bis ( trifluoromethane ) sulfonamide lithium salt ) as additives boost the conductivity and positive charge carrier mobility in the material  Spiro-MeOTAD has a yielded efficiency higher than 20 %  but lacks durability  Because of the expensive processes in the processing of material  it is not the ideal choice11–14 Also  other HTMs  such as PEDOT : PSS  P3HT  and PTAA  lack in chemical stability  have a high fabrication cost in commercialization and small lifespan  These organic HTMs can impart higher efficiency  but are sensitive to environmental factors due to obvious doping needs15–23 So there exists a dire need to find an alternative that can eliminate the existing gaps  Inorganic

promising choice for efficient photovoltaic cells  To obtain high absorbance  CuI exhibits high transmittance in 450–800 nm range as compared to PEDOT : PSS2829 Also  its transparent nature allows more photon flux to reach the absorber layer that induces high photocurrent  Most importantly  its chemical nature makes it a stable and an ideal choice for durable solar cells30 The potential of CuI has not been investigated a lot so far  Among the ample of choices available in inorganic HTMs such as CuO  CuI  CuSCN  CuI is considered a potential candidate to be used as an HTM in PSC  This material is characterized by high transparent conductivity  higher mobility ( 05–2 cm2 /V s1 ) as compared to CuSCN material  and suitable/wider bandgap ( 31 eV ) as compared to copper oxide ( 13– 17 eV )  The wider bandgap of CuI allows high transparency in a visible region along with operability at higher temperatures  Also  the planar structure of CuI exhibits spontaneous removal/ extraction of the holes from the perovskite layer  contributing to higher charge generation31–34 The incorporation of Cd1XZnxS  a ternary compound as an ETM  is less efficient as compared to the widely used TiO2 and ZnO  but stabilizes the structure  The incorporation of metal-sulfide with inorganic HTM has not been reported yet for PSCs  A legitimate blend of mixed ternary ETM and inorganic HTM contributes to the reduction of interface area and prevents surface recombination  whereas CuI exhibits higher mobility and transparency in the visible region  which enables easy charge extraction and contributes toward higher efficiencies  DEVICE SIMULATION METHODOLOGY The numerical simulation of CH3NH3PbI3XClXbased PSC planar structure is carried out using SCAPS 3306  The structure opted for the device simulation is glass substrate/TCO/Cd1XZnXS ( buffer layer ) /defect layer 1/absorber layer ( CH3NH3PbI3XClX ) /defect layer 2/CuI ( HTM ) /back contact  The basic architecture for this is shown in Fig  1  SCAPS 1D is solar cell simulation software which is governed mainly by Poisson and continuity equations for both electrons and holes  Dn @ 2n xð Þ @ x2 þ lEnð Þx @ n xð Þ @ x þ Gnð

respectively  The contributing parameters of each layer are listed in Table I  From the parameters  the calculated valence band offset at the absorber/HTM interface is  143  while the conduction band

series and shunt resistances are taken into account for the back contact and the TCO layer  Each parameter of a layer has its significance over the performance of solar cell device  Parameters in Table I are optimized and analyzed to design an efficient PSC  RESULT AND DISCUSSION Effect of the Electron Affinity of HTM and ETM The electron affinity of HTM varies in the range of 1–3 eV  It can be noted that  at the minimum value of electron affinity  VOC pinned down to almost 0 V due to higher band offsets  whereas at the peak value  JSC has a significant decrease  By varying the affinities and bandgaps  an efficient band offset can be adjusted with ease  The affinity of ETM varies in accordance with the different values of compositions of Zn in the alloy  It can be visualized from Fig  4 that the performance of the PSC continues to improve as the Zn concentration in the alloy increases  This is because the barrier height decreases with the decrease in the offset  The efficient values of the cell are PCE = 2321 %  VOC = 1197  JSC = 2275 mA/cm2  FF = 8519 % at the optimized values of HTM electron affinity ( 26 eV ) and ETM ( 38 eV )  Effect of Doping Concentration of HTM and ETM Proper doping in its contributing materials can augment the performance of a cell  NA in HTM and ND in ETM are responsible for the effective transport of holes and electron  respectively  under the influence of electric field as built-in electric field increases with the increase in doping concentration  The impact of doping concentration in the simulation ( NA ) is assorted from 3 9 1018 cm3 to 7 9 1019 cm3  It can be deftly observed that at lower values of NA  PCE is low due to the presence of high series resistance  On optimizing NA ( 6 9 1019 ) and ND ( 5 9 1017 )  PCE as higher as 2328 % was achieved  The output voltage also increased to 120 VEffect of Thickness of the Absorber Layer The thickness of the absorber is a crucial choice while designing a PSC  It directly affects exciton generation and charge carrier extraction  Recent experimental studies suggested that the mixed halide perovskite efficiently lies in the range of 400–800 nm  Because of the poor light absorption ata lower value of thickness  PCE is degraded  With an increase in the number of charge carriers  the current density increases  leading to enhanced PCE  From 300 nm to 550 nm  PCE increased with the increase in thickness and achieved 2455 % performance efficiency at 700 nm corresponding to VOC = 1162 V  JSC = 2530 mA/cm2  FF = 8345 %  After 700 nm  the performance starts degrading slowly due to the increased recombination rate  There exists a distinction between absorption depth and diffusion length of the generated charge carriers  prompting charge carriers to recombine before extending to the interface  VOC and FF exhibit a gradual decrement as shown in Fig  5 due to the increase in the recombination of charge carriers and resistances as well  Effect of Defect Density of Absorber Layer Defect density is the most critical parameter to be considered while defining the performance of PSC  The charge carriers generated due to photon absorption in the absorber layer ( perovskite layer ) are further separated and traveled to respective ETM and HTM under the influence of the electric field  Quality of absorber layer and its morphologydirectly affects the performance  which may be hampered due to the presence of excessive defects in the layer  These defects cause early recombination of charge carriers  hence limiting the participation  Also  it is well known that Gaussian defect states have a higher impact on charge carrier trapping as compared to the Urbach tail stated  So the Gaussian defects state density is highly responsible for the performance of cell devices  Effect on the performance of device parameters to defect density is represented in Fig  6  It may be that the device parameters exhibit a decrease with anincrease in the defect density in the range 1010– 1015 cm3  At the lowest values of defect density ( 1010 cm3 )  the device is highly efficient  indicating the presence of a fine finished absorber layer with least traps  However  in a practical environment  it is not feasible to manufacture such a smooth and defect-free surface  So the optimized values with a defect density of the order of 1 9 1013 cm3 exhibited a high PCE = 2558 %  JSC = 2533 mA/cm2  FF = 8411 % ; this is better than the results in Ref  35 even at a high defect density of the order of 1013 cm3  The detailed comparison of the result is given in Table II  Effect of Interfaces/Defect Layers The proposed design includes two defect layers  IDL1 and IDL2  respectively  or may be known as interfaces between ETM/absorber and absorber/ HTM  Parametric values for both the interfaces are taken from Table I  In practical film depositions in cell devices  there exist defects due to the methodology used  environmental factors  and also the overall surface area  Performance of solar cell is dependent on the defect density concentration at the interfaces  as a defect in interface causes charge recombination and current generation  This affects the potential of PSC to impart higher efficiencies  The value of defect density is varied from 108 cm3 to 1014 cm3 to make simulated results comparable to the practical limits  The efficiency  VOC  and JSC decrease with the increase in defect concentration at the interfaces  The optimized proposed cell design exhibited a PCE = 2568 % at 1013 cm3 density concentration  The overall maximum quantum efficiency as shown in Fig  7 lies in the range of 300–800 nm range  having constant values in a 300–600 nm range  The use of inorganic HTM surpasses the hole mobility restriction in spiro-MeOTAD and enhances hole conductivity  CuI behaves as an efficient alternative to spiro-MeOTAD  but exhibits lower values of VOC due to the occurrence of higher recombination as demonstrated experimentally in Ref  36  The efficiency of the proposed cell device can be further enhanced by stabilizing the crystal structure of the absorber layer by varying composition of the derivative halide following the co-compounds  Also  improvement in the fabrication processes is also a critical property that defines an efficient device  A potent work in the carrier selective contacts can also have an eminent success in the researchThe mixed halide perovskite with CuI and Cd1XZnXS alloy as HTM and ETM  respectively  are theoretically studied by simulation program to determine their potential to be used as an alternative to the current possibilities  Performance parameters of the device were cautiously analyzed for the grading of crucial parameters that characterize the overall performance  With the selection of optimum electron affinities of HTM and ETM  recombination at the interfaces could be minimized  Effect of doping profiles also drastically affects the performance  An optimized thickness of absorber layer ( 700 nm ) could absorbImproved performance and reproducibility of perovskite solar cells by jointly tuning the hole transport layer and the perovskite layer depositionAbstract Solution processed organometal trihalide materials spur tremendous attention due to their unprecedented performance in photovoltaic applications  However  submicron thick perovskite films are prone to morphological defects in the form of cracks  pinholes and porosity ; the traits originated from their solution phase processing and subsequent crystallization  Moreover  pinholes and cracks in the thin film of spincoated Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer reduce the performance reliability by forming micro shorts and weaken the defense against moisture ingress to the perovskite layer  For the large scale processing of perovskite solar cell from the economically prudent solution phase processing  morphological shortcomings of both perovskite and hole transport layers need an urgent address  By selecting non-conventional lead precursor ( lead acetate ) and implementing anti-solvent treatment during film deposition  we able to form pinhole free and compact perovskite film  Crack free hole conducting layer is obtained by blending Spiro-OMeTAD with a conducting polymer without compromising in the solar cell performance  A detail investigation of the charge transport and charge extraction properties of the developed hole transport layers have been carried out  The developed CH3NH3PbI3 based perovskite solar cells show improved repeatability and performance  Similar content being viewed by othersThe discovery and subsequent phenomenal growth of perovskite solar cells have boosted the green energy drive largely thanks to the immense interest and participation of the groups all around the world [ 1234 ]  Properties like high carrier mobility [ 5 ]  long recombination lifetime [ 6 ]  high carrier diffusion length [ 6  7 ] and high open circuit voltage ( Voc ) [ 8  9 ] make perovskite a very sought after material for the next generation solar cell development  Numerous film deposition strategies and device architectural platforms have been explored and developed to attain high power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) in perovskite solar cells  In recent past  the highest PCE of 221 % has been achieved by the use of tri-iodide ions as the additives in the formamidinium lead iodide perovskite films [ 10 ]  whereas highest reported efficiency in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite is around 18 % [ 4  11 ]  From the first report by Kojima et al  in DSSC architecture [ 12 ] to the most advanced planar solar cells [ 13 ]  CH3NH3PbI3 has been the choice of sensitizer and most widely studied perovskite material  The processing of CH3NH3PbI3 material has critical implications in tuning the material properties which in turn regulate its performance in solar cells [ 14 ]  For instance  halide based lead sources ( PbI2 PbBr2 and PbCl2 ) manifests high PCE compared to non-halide sources like lead acetate ( PbAc2 ) and lead nitrate [ 15 ]  However  perovskite films from nonhalide sources are more smooth and reproducible [ 15 ] ; qualities deemed for large scale manufacturing and commercializationhe importance of the hole transport layer ( HTL ) in the stability and performance of perovskite solar cells is palpable when liquid electrolyte is replaced by the solid state layer 22′77′-Tetrakis- ( N  N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino ) -99′-spirobifluorene ( Spiro-OMeTAD ) [ 16 ]  A number of HTLs are developed and implemented thus far in the perovskite solar cell including Spiro-OMeTAD  poly ( triarylamine ) ( PTAA ) [ 17 ]  Poly ( 3-hexylthiophene-25-diyl ) ( P3HT ) [ 18 ]  CuSCN [ 19 ]  CuI [ 20 ]  Cu2O [ 21 ]  NiO [ 22  23 ] etc  Spiro-OMeTAD yields high PCE in perovskite solar cells and is one of the most widely studied HTL as of today  It is  however  shown that Spiro-OMeTAD has some serious limitations in terms of stability  reproducibility and large area deposition [ 24 ]  The solution phase deposition of Spiro-OMeTAD small molecules leads to reduced surface coverage and pinholes in their thin films  Domanski et al  [ 25 ] show that top Au electrode seeps through the Spiro-OMeTAD layer  which reduces the device reproducibility and stability by forming micro level shortening of the Spiro-OMeTAD film  This adversely impact the PCE and reproducibility in the case of large area perovskite solar cell development  Further  the pinholes of the Spiro-OMeTAD layer which are not covered by the metal electrodes provides paths for the moisture ingress to the perovskite layer leading to fast degradation of perovskite film and the solar cell PCE under ambient operations  P3HT is a widely studied polymer in organic solar cells [ 26 ] and being a polymer forms smooth and compact films from solution phase spin coating [ 27 ]  It is  however  shown that in comparison to Spiro-OMeTAD  the performance of P3HT as HTL in perovskite solar cells is inferior [ 28 ]  limiting their use in the development of perovskite solar cells  In our effort to develop reliable and efficient perovskite solar cells  we have focused both on perovskite layer deposition and HTL layer formation sequentially to address the pinhole and micro shorts formation in solution process perovskite solar cells  In the case of solution phase film deposition the evaporation of solvent molecules  organic residue and contraction of perovskite crystals introduce pinholes and cracks in their thin films which are detrimental for their performance and reproducibility in solar cells [ 29 ]  In order to avoid the crack formation in perovskite layer  various strategies have been adopted in past  namely two step deposition ( using PbI2 as Pb source ) [ 30 ]  hot casting method [ 31 ] and mix solvent approach [ 32 ] and use of mesoporous TiO2 layer instead of planar TiO2 layer  Single step deposition from room temperature spin coating using a single solvent is more facile and is desirable for greater reproducibility and large area deposition of perovskite film  Conventional halide based lead sources though yield high PCE due to the formation of bigger CH3NH3PbI3 crystals but possess higher degree porosity and roughness which are detrimental to consistency and reliability [ 33 ]  We primarily focus on PbAc2 as lead precursor mixed with methylammonium iodide to form the smooth and compact perovskite films  The perovskite films prepared by PbAc2 require less annealing temperature and annealing time to crystallize when compared to conventional lead sources like PbI2 and PbCl2  This is attributed to volatile by-product of CH3NH3Ac in the case of PbAc2 precursor [ 15  34 ]  The perovskite films based on PbAc2 precursors are deprived of temperature induced anomalies as a result higher stoichiometry and lesser defects ( structural and electronic ) are observed in their perovskite films  It is  however  observed that perovskite films developed from PbAc2 precursor have smaller grain boundaries ( < 1 µm ) [ 15  34 ]  In the case of solar cell application  large crystalline size would be beneficial for fast transportation and suppressed recombination of photogenerated carriers  In this study  we have shown that the grain size of perovskite crystals from PbAc2 can be improved by increasing the precursor concentration and treating the perovskite films with anti-solvent during the deposition process  Smooth and pinhole free perovskite films are observed using the deposition approach developed here  Further  pinholes and cracks of the Spiro-OMeTAD HTL layer is eliminated by blending Spiro-OMeTAD with polymer P3HT  We have shown that at optimum P3HT : Spiro-OMeTAD blend ratio both high solar cell performance and good reproducibility can be achieved  From surface characterizations and mobility data we have shown that at optimum blend ratio good film morphology with no pinholes and high hole mobility are attained to explain their superior performance in solar cells2 Experimental 21 Chemicals PbAc2·3H2O ( 99999 % )  P3HT ( 99995 % )  Bis ( trifluoromethane ) sulfonimide lithium salt ( LiTFSI ) ( 9995 % )  4-tert-Butylpyridine ( 96 % )  dimethylformamide ( DMF )  Chlorobenzene and Isopropanol were procured from Sigma-Aldrich whereas Methylammonium iodide was obtained from Dyesol  22 Substrate preparation Transparent conductive FTO substrates were procured commercially and were etched using a mixture of ZnO/HCl before use  FTO substrates were cleaned sequentially using soap solution  deionized water  acetone and boiling isopropanol before processing  23 Electron transport layer ( ETL ) preparation TiO2 was used as ETL in this study  TiO2 layer preparation was carried out using the reported approach [ 35 ]  however  precursor concentration was modified for optimal results  369 µL of Titanium isopropoxide was first taken in 253 mL of isopropanol and stirred for 12 h 14 µL of 5N HCl was added drop wise followed by another 253 mL of isopropanol  The solution was left to stir for another 12 h to form a transparent solution  TiO2 ETL layer was deposited by spincoating the prepared solution over the cleaned FTO substrates at 3500 rpm  for 40 s The coated substrates were then annealed on a hotplate at 500 °C for 1 h TiO2 substrates were then submerged in the deionized water in a petridish and heated to 70 °C under constant stirring  TiCl4 ( 135 µL per 20 mL of water ) was added to the solution and left for 30 min to form the compact TiO2 layer  Then substrates were washed with deionized water and annealed at 500 °C for another 1 h to complete the TiO2 layer formation  The substrates were then transferred to an argon filled glove box for further layer deposition  24 Formation of CH3NH3PbI3 layer Perovskite solutions were made by mixing PbAc2 and Methyl ammonium iodide ( CH3NH3I ) in the ratio 1:32 with DMF as the solvent  For optimum perovskite layer thickness and film quality  405 mg of PbAc2 was mixed to 545 mg of CH3NH3I in1 ml of DMF and stirred for 2 h prior to deposition  The solution was then spin coated inside an argon glove box at 3500 rpm  ramp speed of 1500 rpm/s for 45 s For anti-solvent treatment the spin coating is done in two steps  initially  after 30 s of 3500 rpm rotation the spin speed was raised to 5000 rpm and 100 µL of chlorobenzene was added to the film swiftly and rotated for another 10 s The anti-solvent treated perovskite films turned brown immediately after anti-solvent treatment whereas untreated perovskite films remained transparent after the spin coating  The films were further left to dry inside the glove box for 2 h before annealing  The films were annealed for 15 min at 100 °C in a hotplate for complete conversion of perovskite layer to the yield the dark brown film  25 Hole transport layer ( HTL ) preparation The solution for Spiro-OMeTAD was prepared using 65 mg/mL Spiro-OMeTAD in chlorobenzene  70 µL of LiTFSI solution ( 170 mg/mL in acetonitrile ) and 20 µL of 4-tert butyl pyridine was added to 1 mL spiro-OMeTAD solution as additive [ 36 ]  The P3HT solution was prepared by adding 20 mg of P3HT in 1 mL of chlorobenzene  Blend HTL layers were prepared by adding different weight proportion of P3HT to the Spiro-OMeTAD solution  The blend solutions were stirred for 1 h at 50 °C before film formation  Smooth films were obtained by rapidly pouring 50 µL of solution over rotating substrates at 4000 rpm and spun for 30 s The devices were then stored under dark ambient conditions overnight before proceeding to the electrode deposition  To complete the solar cell formation 20 nm of gold followed by 100 nm of silver was deposited on top of the films using a thermal evaporator at the base pressure of 1 × 10−6 Torr  26 Characterizations Surface electron microscopy ( SEM ) was carried out using FEI Nova Nano SEM 450  X-ray

smooth perovskite layer is indispensable in order to achieve reproducible and consistent performance in submicron thick solution processed perovskite solar cells  Perovskite solutions of different concentration are made by mixing PbAc2 and CH3NH3I in the ratio 1:32 with DMF as the solvent  In our attempt  we have optimized the precursor concentration and employed the anti-solvent treatment during film coating to increase the crystallite size and reduce the pinholes in the perovskite films  Perovskite films are formed using spin coating process  It is observed that higher precursor concentration gives smoother and more compact perovskite films  However  when the precursor concentration is increased beyond 1000 mg/mL the resulting films started to crack when dried  The optimum precursor concentration is found to be 950 mg/mL in DMF solvent  The use of anti-solvent is found to further improve the quality of the perovskite films [ 4 ]  The scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) images of the perovskite films for optimum precursor concentration without and with anti-solvent treatment are shown in Fig  1a  b respectively  The untreated ( no anti-solvent ) film shows varied crystallite size with a minimum of 400 nm and few large crystal grains ranging up to 980 nm in diameter  The pinholes are evident in the film at the studied magnification  The use of anti-solvent increases the average crystal grain size to 1 µm as shown in Fig  1b  Moreover  the pinholes are being effectively removed from the perovskite films  SEM results clearly suggest that the anti-solvent treated perovskite films are more prudent for solar cell development  The findings from SEM study are further corroborated by X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) results as shown in Fig  1c  d respectively for untreated and anti-solvent treated perovskite films  X-ray diffraction confirms the formation of tetragonal phase CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite crystals with lattice parameters a = b = 885 Å and c = 1264 Å XRD of untreated perovskite film ( Fig  1c ) shows that the principal growth direction is along ( 110 ) plane located at 142° [ 37  38 ]  This implies that the crystals are oriented towards the long axis parallel to the substrate  Other intense peaks are of the second reflection form ( 220 ) plane at 284°  ( 112 ) planes at 200° and ( 224 ) planes at 406°  In the case of antisolvent treated perovskite films  the peak intensity for ( 110 ) and ( 220 ) planes are found to be more than doubled whereas the intensity corresponding to ( 112 ) and ( 224 ) planes remain almost the same  This implies the oriented growth of perovskite films along ( 110 ) plane ( parallel to the substrate ) due to anti-solvent treatment which leads to bigger crystallite size and compact film  The oriented growth of perovskite crystals is envisaged to facilitate the carrier transport and improve the efficiency in solar cellsThe photovoltaic device architecture used in this study is shown in Fig  2a  The TiO2 layer is grown on top of the FTO coated glass substrate  followed by perovskite layer deposition  HTL deposition and electrode formation  The cross-sectional SEM image of a finished solar cell ( Fig  2a ) indicates the formation of various layers  Respective thicknesses for different layers can be identified from the scale bar  The solar cells are characterized inside an argon filled glovebox  It is observed that despite tedious optimization to form compact perovskite layer the performance of the developed solar cells using Spiro-OMeTAD as HTL are inconsistent and prone to degradation under continuous operation  We further sought to investigate the role of the HTL in the degradation of the perovskite solar cells  It is observed that the use of Spiro-OMeTAD as the top layer  though functional  is far from perfect  Agglomeration of Spiro-OMeTAD on the film surface is visible even by naked eye  The high resolution SEM image of Spiro-OMeTAD film shows the presence of big crack on the film surface as shown in Fig  2b  During the top electrode deposition  metal atoms can penetrate through the cracks and get in direct contact with the perovskite layer  These metal filaments provide the less resistive path to the carriers for recombination/injection  giving rise to a significant flow of current through a small area which may lead to burning of the perovskite layer and the subsequent death of the solar cells [ 25 ]  Reproducibility  stability and performance of a solar cell are significantly hampered in the case of filament formation  P3HT has been reported to act as HTL for perovskite solar cell with reasonable good efficiency but superior stability owing to its polymeric nature which helps to form pinhole free film [ 27 ]  We attempt to improve the quality of the HTL by blending Spiro-OMeTAD with the conducting polymer P3HT  P3HT is selected for the study due to its solubility in common non-polar solvents with Spiro-OMeTAD  favorable HOMO–LUMO positions to act as a HTL and good hole mobility  We envisage that in order to act as efficient HTL the blend film must possess the following qualities ; ( 1 ) form smooth pinhole free film over the perovskite layer  ( 2 ) the HOMO level of the blend film should favor the efficient hole transfer from the perovskite layer  and ( 3 ) the hole mobility of the blend film should be high enough for efficient transportation of the hole carriers to the electrode  The SEM image of the P3HT film ( Fig  2c ) shows a highly compact film with no pinholes  In comparison to Spiro-OMeTAD film ( Fig  2b ) blend of P3HT and Spiro-OMETAD film ( Fig  2d ) improves the surface coverage and compactness significantly to eliminate the pinhole formation  This prompts us to apply the blend film in solar cell devices to test their performance as the HTL  Fig  2 order to elucidate the carrier extraction and transport properties of the blend HTLs  photovoltaic devices are fabricated for the varied weight proportion of P3HT to Spiro-OMeTAD  Different solar cell parameters  namely Jsc  Voc  FF and PCE for the varied blend ratios are shown in Fig  3a–d  respectively  The standard deviation in photovoltaic parameters for different batches is indicated by the error bar  From the Jsc distribution  we can see that high current is obtained for most of the blend ratios barring the terminal blend ratios ( 1:20 ) and ( 1:2 )  The highest average Voc is seen in the case of Spiro-OMeTAD and the 1:3 blend ( P3HT : Spiro-OMeTAD ) devices with the latter being more consistent and stable  Most consistent and high photovoltaic performances are achieved for the blend ratios 2:9 and 1:3  However  1:3 blend produces higher FF repetitively to yield the highest average PCE among the lot  The J-V characteristics of the best performing solar cells under solar illumination based on Spiro-OMeTAD  P3HT and 1:3 blend HTLs are shown in Fig  3e  The highest performance in the case of Spiro-OMeTAD is obtained to be 1123 % in which the performance is limited by the moderate FF ( 05 )  In the case of P3HT  885 % PCE is obtained with the dismal performance in Voc ( 08 V ) and FF ( 049 )  In comparison  the performance of the 1:3 blend based device is superior ( PCE = 1487 % ) due to improvement in Voc ( 094 V ) and FF ( 070 )  All the solar cell devices show hysteresis in their J–V characteristics  The photovoltaic parameters for reverse and forward voltage scan are tabulated in Table 1  The P3HT and the 1:3 blend HTL based solar cell shows relatively less hysteresis compared to Spiro-OMeTAD based solar cellsTo determine the factors affecting the performance of the solar cells as shown in Fig  3e and Table 1  impedance spectroscopy is performed  From the Nyquist plot ( Zreal vs Zimg ) of the photovoltaic devices based on Spiro-OMeTAD  P3HT and 1:3 blend as HTL ( Fig  4a  c  e respectively )  series resistance  recombination resistance and carrier recombination lifetimes are determined  The Nyquist plot for Spiro-OMeTAD clearly shows two semicircular arcs appeared at different applied frequency regime  whereas P3HT and 1:3 blend based solar cells shows one arc for the entire frequency range of 100 Hz–1 MHz range  The equivalent circuit model requires a minimum of two parallel R–C combinations in order to contemplate the Nyquist plot for Spiro-OMeTAD based solar cells ( Fig  4b )  whereas one R–C combination is sufficient to simulate the Nyquist plots for P3HT and 1:3 blend based solar cells ( Fig  4d )  In the case of Spiro-OMeTAD HTL two R–C combinations may originate from perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD and perovskite/metal interfaces  The pinholes in the Spiro-OMeTAD HTL allow the direct contact of the metal electrode with the perovskite layer  This facilitates the alternate transport path for the charge carrier to bypass the Spiro-OMeTAD layer and makes the perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD junction leaky  Due to the high conductivity of the metals  the R–C arc of perovskite/metal contact should appear at higher frequency regime  Therefore  we attribute the low frequency arc to leaky perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD junction and the high frequency arc to perovskite/metal junction  In the case of P3HT and 1:3 blend HTL based solar cells appearance of one arc in the Nyquist plot implies good junction properties between perovskite and the HTLs  Series and recombination resistance of the solar cells are determined from Zreal–Zimg plots using the following approximation  at low frequency ( 100 Hz )  Zreal = series resistance + recombination resistance  and at frequency 1 MHz  Zreal = series resistance  Series more light and exhibit PCE up to 2454 %  Defect density is the critical parameter to be optimized to sustain the practicality of the device  Even at the defect density of as higher as 1 9 1013 cm3  the overall PCE of the solar cell device summed up to 2568 % with JSC as higher as 2533 mA/cm2 and FF = 8411 % after optimization  which is persuading  The results demonstrated that CuI as an HTM with mixed halide perovskite is competent enough to replace costly spiro-MeOTAD and exhibits high potential as a future alternative  Optimization of parameters can further improve the performance of the PSCesistance is found to be 30 ± 2 Ω for all the devices  suggesting no apparent variation in series resistance for different blend layers  This is consistent with the fact that major contribution in series resistance arises from the space charge region of the junctions  not from the quasi-neutral region of individual layers  The recombination resistance accounts for much deeper insight into the recombination process of the solar cells  Higher recombination resistance reduces photo carrier recombination and improves FF and current for the solar cells  The recombination resistances are determined and compared for different HTLs ( Fig  4f ) under solar illumination for varied applied bias between 0 V and Voc  The recombination resistances for 1:3 blend layer is higher than P3HT and Spiro-OMeTAD at any given applied bias  In the case of P3HT as HTL the recombination resistance shows abrupt decay with the increase in bias  suggesting the lack of diffusion transport and dominance of drift transport of photo carriers in P3HT layer  which may originate from low carrier mobility of the P3HT film  This property is reflected on the low FF of the P3HT based solar cells  In the case of Spiro-OMeTAD  the leak in the perovskite/ Spiro-OMeTAD junction reduces the effective recombination resistance which comes in between P3HT and blend  Photo carrier recombination lifetime in the photovoltaic devices is determined from the Nyquist plots by obtaining the frequency ( f ) at which Zimg is maximum  also denoted as characteristic frequency ( ω0 = 2πf ) [ 39 ]  Under 15 AM illumination recombination lifetimes ( τ = 1/ω0 ) for different HTLs are plotted against applied bias as shown in Fig  4g  The carrier lifetime for the blend HTL shows very little dependence with the applied bias which could be responsible for the high FF ( 070 ) in their solar cell characteristics  In comparison to blend both P3HT and Spiro-OMeTAD based devices shows a steady decay in their carrier lifetime with the increase in applied bias which is reflected on the shape of their J–V characteristics  Spiro-OMETAD based solar cell shows the lowest carrier lifetime values  this could be due to fast recombination of electron and hole at perovskite-metal interfaceThe charge transport properties of the blend layer should depend on the formation of continuous charge transport network through individual components ie  Spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT  In the case of organic semiconductors  charge transport is dominated by hopping transport from one site to another  In the absence of continuous charge transport network in blend layer  hole transport would be hindered by the HOMO level energy mismatch between adjacent sites  which would result in the decrease in hole mobility and increase in potential drop across the HTL in solar cells  We sought to investigate the hole mobility for different HTLs used in this study  Hole mobility is determined by space charge limited conduction mechanism using ITO–HTL–Au device configuration  ITO and Au are chosen as electrodes to establish ohmic contact for the hole with the HTLs and to ensure that at a given applied bias only hole injection to the HTLs is possible  At the high injection region current inside the HTLs would be controlled by the accumulation of holes inside the bulk of the HTLs and can be explained by space charge limited mechanism ( SCLC ) ie  where is the current density  is the applied bias  d is the HTL layer thickness  is the mobility  is the permittivity of air and is the relative dielectric constant of HTLs which is considered as 35 in this study  The J–V characteristics fordifferent HTLs are shown in Fig  5  The hole motilities determined for different HTLs are shown in Table 2  As can be seen that the hole mobility for the P3HT is lowest  intermediate for the blend and highest for the Spiro-OMeTAD  From the observation  we infer that the charge transport inside the blend layer is dominated by the Spiro-OMeTAD and the small reduction in blend mobility in comparison to pristine Spiro-OMeTAD could be due to the reduction in effective area and a possible increase in path length through the higher conducting Spiro-OMeTAD channel inside the blend layer  The magnitude of the hole mobility further emphasize that the charge transport network through the Spiro-OMeTAD network is not breached for the optimum blend ratio which is critical for high solar cell performancesConclusion We have shown that the use of anti-solvent and optimal precursor concentration allows to form consistent  pinhole free  compact and large crystallite size perovskite film using PbAc2 as the lead precursor  The pinholes and cracks of the Spiro-OMeTAD HTL layer are effectively removed by blending Spiro-OMeTAD with the polymer P3HT  From a series of blend ratios  optimum ratio is identified to be 1:3 P3HT : Spiro-OMeTAD to yield highest PCE of 1487 % in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells  In optimum blend layer  high hole mobility from Spiro-OMeTAD and compact film morphology from the P3HT polymer is duly obtained to improve the performance and consistency of the perovskite solar cell  The developed strategy to form compact and pinhole free HTL by blending Spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT could further be implemented to develop high performance solar cells using low band gap

hot-casting method with five different Pb ( SCN ) 2/PbI2 levels ( x = 0  025  05  1 and 2 )  Substitution of SCN− in the CH3NH3PbI3 structures induces a film color transformation from black to yellow  UV vis spectra of CH3NH3Pb ( SCN ) xI3−x films display an increased band gap from 159 eV ( pure CH3NH3PbI3 film ) to 237 eV ( MAPb ( SCN ) 2I films )  Experimental XRD spectra of CH3NH3Pb ( SCN ) xI3−x films for increasing SCN− levels show a reduced angle of the ( 110 ) plane in the same trend as for the simulated tetragonal CH3NH3Pb ( SCN ) xI3−x structures  The calculated bandgap of simulated tetragonal CH3NH3Pb ( SCN ) xI3−x structures also increases with the SCN− concentration  Maximal efficiency  456 %  was gained from a carbon-based hole-transport layer ( HTL ) -free CH3NH3PbI3 ( x = 0 ) perovskite solar cell  This is attributed to the low bandgap of CH3NH3PbI3 ( 159 eV )  Although  the efficiency of the carbon-based HTL-free CH3NH3Pb ( SCN ) xI3−x solar cells decreases with increasing SCN− ratio  the excellent solar cell stability was obtained from carbon-based HTLfree CH3NH3Pb ( SCN ) xI3−x ( x = 025  05  1 and 2 ) solar cells  This should be influenced by the presence of the hydrogen bonds between H and S and/or H and N in the CH3NH3Pb ( SCN ) xI3−x structures  The carbon-based HTL-free CH3NH3Pb ( SCN ) 05I25 solar cell delivers a promising efficiency of 307 %  and its efficiency increases by 1140 % of its initial value after 30-day storage  Keywords : Solar cell  Perovskite  Tetragonal  CH3NH3Pb ( SCN ) xI3−x DOI : 103938/jkps771210 I  INTRODUCTION Perovskite solar cells have received much attention from researchers globally because of their high efficiency  ease of fabrication and low production costs  The CH3NH3PbI3 ( MAPbI3 ) perovskite was first used as a light absorber in dye-sensitized solar cell devices with an efficiency of 381 % [ 1  2 ]  After that  many studies had been done on applying this perovskite film as a light absorber in solid-state perovskite solar cells  which are now known as “ perovskite solar cells ”  The rapid advancement of the perovskite solar-cell ’ s efficiency continues with a recently reported efficiency of 252 % [ 34 ]  This significantly improved efficiency is attributed to the special properties of MAPbI3 : a high light absorption coefficient  a high carrier mobility and a long carrier diffusion length [ 4–9 ]  Although  MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells deliver superior solar cell performance  the MAPbI3 material strongly interacts with moisture  shortening its operating lifetime [ 5 ]  One of the attempts to extend the perovskite solar cell lifetime was to substitute stable moieties into the MAPbI3 perovskite structure  For example  inorganic Cs+ was substituted at the organic MA+ site [ 10–13 ]  or Br− was substituted at the I− site [ 14– 16 ] or SCN− was substituted at the I− site [ 17–20 ]  The replacement of some I− ions with SCN− ions in forming CH3NH3Pb ( SCN ) xI3−x ( MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x ) perovskite films was found to significantly enhance moisture resistance and cell stability [ 171821 ]  This is because SCN− forms a stronger bond with Pb2+ than with I−  Jiang et al  successfully prepared CH3NH3Pb ( SCN ) 2I perovskite solar cells with a cell efficiency of 83 % [ 18 ]  The CH3NH3Pb ( SCN ) xI3−x perovskite solar cells showed a slight efficiency reduction from 83 % to 74 % after 14 days compared to that of a MAPbI3 perovskite solar cell  which decreased from 88 % to 69 % after 7 days  Chen ∗E-mail : wiratja @ kkuacth †E-mail : samuk @ gswuacth et al  also observed that the SCN−-doped MAPbI3 perovskite films ( 5 wt % Pb ( SCN ) 2 ) induced a perovskite grain size larger than that of a pure MAPbI3 film and that a SCN− doped MAPbI3 solar cell had a solar cell efficiency ( 1107 % ) higher than that of a pure MAPbI3 perovskite solar cell  724 % [ 19 ]  They also observed improved stability of the MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x perovskite solar cells while their efficiency decreased from 1107 % to 101 % after 1 hr  compared to the pure MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells that showed fast efficiency decrease from 724 % to 417 % after 1 hr  Typically  a Spiro-OmeTAD polymer and gold ( Au ) film are used as hole transport ( HTL ) and hole-collecting ( HCL ) layers  respectively  to achieve high-efficiency perovskite solar cell performance  However  the estimated expenses of a Spiro-OmeTAD polymer and a Au film are ∼50 % of the total perovskite solar cell cost [ 22  23 ]  Promising efficiencies of 687 % –1573 % and good cell stabilities were achieved from carbon-based HTLfree perovskite solar cells [ 24–27 ]  Thus  in this work  we were interested in investigating the effect of the SCN−- dopant level on the properties of the MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x films and on the performance of carbon-based HTLfree MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x perovskite solar cells  A significant film color transformation from black to yellow with the substitution of SCN− moieties at I− sites was observed for the MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x films  The efficiency of the MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x perovskite solar cells strongly depended on the SCN− dopant  and great cell stability was obtained from the MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x perovskite solar cells as compared to the pure MAPbI3 perovskite solar cell  Our literature review failed to reveal any reports on color conversion and the efficiency reduction with increasing high SCN− concentration in MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x films  To explain the effect of SCN− on the color of the MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x film  we used the hot-casting method to prepare five different MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x films ( x =0  025  05  1 and 2 )  The films ’ physical properties  crystal structure and optical properties were characterized and

( SCN ) xI3−x solar cells were characterized and discussed in detail  II  EXPERIMENTAL 1  TiO2 Film Preparation Fluorine-doped tin-oxide ( FTO ) glass substrates ( Sigma Aldrich  15 Ω sq−1 ) were patterned using zinc powder and hydrochloric acid ( 3 M )  Then  they were cleaned with detergent  water  deionized water and ethanol for 15 min in each cleaning step  The etched FTO substrates were treated with UV light ( UV ozone cleaning system  Model UV-208 ) for 10 min before depositing the TiO2 films on them  TiO2 blocking layer ( BL-TiO2 ) films were prepared using a doctor blade method ; then  they were annealing at 500 ◦C for 1 hr  A mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited on the BL-TiO2 by using a spin coating technique at 4000 rpm for 45 s  employing transparent TiO2 paste 90T ( Greatcell Solar  165 g diluted in ethanol  6 ml )  and were annealed at 500 ◦C for 1 hr  2  CH3NH3Pb ( SCN ) xI3−x Film Preparation and Cell Assembly Five different solutions of methylammonium iodide ( CH3NH3I ( MAI )  98 %  Aldrich )  lead ( II ) thiocyanate ( Pb ( SCN ) 2  995 %  Aldrich ) and lead ( II ) iodide ( PbI2  99 %  Aldrich ) in dimethyl formamide ( DMF  Aldrich ) and dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO  Aldrich ) solvents were prepared  The first was a mixture of 125 M MAI and 125 M PbI2 in DMF/DMSO ( 9:1 v/v )  used to prepare the MAPbI3 ( x = 0 ) film  The second  a mixture of 125 M MAI  016 M Pb ( SCN ) 2 and 109 M PbI2 in DMF/DMSO ( 9:1 v/v ) was used to prepare the MAPb ( SCN ) 025I275 ( x = 025 ) film  The third  a mixture of 125 M MAI  031 M Pb ( SCN ) 2 and 094 M PbI2 in DMF/DMSO ( 9:1 v/v ) was used to prepare the MAPb ( SCN ) 05I25 ( x = 05 ) film  The fourth was a mixture of 125 M MAI  0625 M Pb ( SCN ) 2 and 0625 M PbI2 in DMF/DMSO ( 9:1 v/v ) and was used to prepare the MAPb ( SCN ) I2 ( x = 1 ) film  The last was a mixture of 125 M MAI and 125 M Pb ( SCN ) 2 in DMF/DMSO ( 9:1 v/v )  and was used to prepare the MAPb ( SCN ) 2I ( x = 2 ) film  Prior to the perovskite coating  the TiO2 films were pre-heated at 145 ◦C for 2 min  Then  the hot TiO2 films were quickly transferred to a spin coater  Thirty-five microliters ( 35 μl ) of each solution was spun onto the heated TiO2 films at a spin rate of 3000 rpm for 45 s  and the films ’ surfaces were treated with ethyl acetate ( EA ) 10 s after spinning  The films were placed on a hot plate and heated at 120 ◦C for 20 min to obtain the perovskite films  The MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x films had fixed areas with active areas of 03 × 1 cm2  Carbon paste was coated onto the fixed area to complete the electrical circuit  This carbon paste was prepared in our lab as follows : Polyvinyl acetate ( PVAc  25 g ) was dissolved in 30 ml of ethyl acetate  Then  2 g of carbon black powder and 6 g of graphite flake powder were added to this PVAc solution  The mixture solution was slowly evaporated at 80 ◦C until completely dry  Chlorobenzene ( 30 ml ) was added to the dried carbon and stirred to produce a carbon paste  All preparation processes ( TiO2 film  perovskite film and carbon coating ) were done under ambient environmental conditions with a relative humidity of around 50 % –60 %  3  Film and Cell Characterization For the optical imaging and UV-vis measurements ( UV-1800  Shimadzu  Japan )  the perovskite films were coated on heated FTO surfaces via a hot-casting method  as described above  The crystallinity of the MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x films was characterized using Xray diffraction ( XRD  PANalytical  EMPYREAN )  The MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x morphology and thickness were characterized using scanning electron microscopy ( MiniSEM  SEC  SNE 4500M )  The solar cell characteristics were determined using a solar simulator ( PEC-L11  Japan ) under a light intensity of 100 mW/cm2 at 15 AM  4  MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x Structure Simulation Tetragonal MAPbI3 structures were built  as previously reported [ 28  29 ]  This structure was optimized using the van der Waals density functional theory ( vdwDFT ) and implemented using VASP software [ 30 ]  In this study  we used the optimized tetragonal MAPbI3 structure as an initial structure in constructing four other tetragonal MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x ( x = 025  05  1 and 2 ) materials  MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x structures were optimized based on the vdw-DFT  Optimized MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x structures were used to simulate XRD spectra for comparison with the experimental XRD spectra  The densities of states and the energy bandgaps of the optimized MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x structures were estimated  The numbers of hydrogen bonds and the hydrogen bond lengths in MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x were also calculated  III  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 1  CH3NH3Pb ( SCN ) xI3−x Films MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x films were prepared via a hotcasting method with five different SCN−

images of FTO glass and MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x Films ( x = 0  025  050  10 and 20 )  The optical images of the hot-casted MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x films at these five SCN− concentrations are presented in Fig  1  The films were observed to exhibit a significant color transformation from black to yellow with increasing SCN− dopant levels  This shows that the presence of the SCN− moiety in MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x structures strongly altered the films ’ optical properties  The SEM image of the MAPbI3 film in Fig  2 ( a ) displays a smooth and continuous surface with no pinholes  SCN− substitution in MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x at x = 025 and 05 at the I− sites still produced continuous and smooth surfaces  as seen in Figs  2 ( c ) and 2 ( e )  respectively  In contrast  the films with high SCN− fractions  x = 1 and 2  induce the formation of rod-like structures on the surfaces as seen in Figs  2 ( g ) and 2 ( i )  The MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x films ’ thicknesses measured from the cross-section SEM images in Fig  2 are 194 ± 0046 μm  202 ± 0088 μm  10 ± 0099 μm  130 ± 016 μm and 130 ± 012 μm for x = 0  025  05  1 and 2  respectively  which are quite similar thickness  The optical properties of the MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x films were analyzed using UV-vis spectroscopy  and their absorption spectra are shown in Fig  3 ( a )  Their optical bandgaps ( Eg ) were estimated from the Tauc plots in Fig  S1 ( in the Supplementary Material ) and are listed in Table 1  The energy gap of MAPbI3 ( x = 0 ) film in this work is ∼159 eV  which agrees with published literature values [ 18  20  21  31 ]  The slight SCN− substitution on I− sites at x = 025 and 05 did not significantly affect the energy bandgap  as seen in Table 1  This is consistent with their black color  which is the same as the color of a pure MAPbI3 film ( as seen in Fig  1 )  However  the films at high SCN− ratios ( x = 1 and 2 ) have very large bandgap values of 238 eV and 237 eV for MAPb ( SCN ) I2 and MAPb ( SCN ) 2I films  respectively  The increased bandgap values are accompaniedby a color change to yellow for the MAPb ( SCN ) I2 and the MAPb ( SCN ) 2I films as seen in Fig  1  The crystal structures of the MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x films were characterized by XRD analysis  and the results are presented in Fig  3 ( b )  Major peaks at 1409◦  2839◦  3182◦ and 4060◦ were detected for the MAPbI3 films and were indexed to the ( 110 )  ( 220 )  ( 310 ) and ( 224 ) planes of the tetragonal MAPbI3 perovskite structure  respectively [ 28  29 ]  The XRD spectra of the MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x films at x = 025  05 and 1 show a splitting of the ( 110 ) plane into two peaks  are centered at 13◦ and the other at 1409◦  implying a reduced crystal symmetry in these MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x structures  The intensity of the 1409◦ peak decreases with increasing SCN− concentrations while the intensity of the 13◦ peak increases  In the case of the MAPb ( SCN ) 2I film  only the peak at 13◦ is observed  The shift of the ( 110 ) plane toward a lower angle for the MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x films suggests a volume expansion of the unit cell  Although  the radius of SCN− ( 0215–022 nm ) is close to that of I− ( 022 nm ) [ 172032 ]  the shapes of these molecules are different  The SCN− moiety has a linear shape whereas the I− ion is spherical  To deeply understand the efFig  4  ( a ) The simulated tetragonal MAPbI3 structure  ( b ) the simulated tetragonal MAPb ( SCN ) 2I structure  and ( c ) density of states ( DOS ) of the simulated tetragonal MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x structures  fect of SCN− on the crystal structure and optical properties of this material  a tetragonal MAPbI3 structure was constructed as previously described [ 28  29 ]  The MAPbI3 structure was first optimized based on the van der Waals density functional theory ( vdw-DFT ) using VASP software without a structural constraint  A van der Waals density functional was chosen in these calculations because the organic MA+ can form hydrogen bond to I− [ 33–35 ]  SCN− is an organic molecule  so applying a vdw functional is expected to produce more accurate results  The optimized tetragonal MAPbI3 structure is presented in Fig  4 ( a )  and unit-cell parameters are listed in Table S1  The optimized MAPbI3 was used as an initial structure for constructing MAPb ( SCN ) xIEg values in Fig  S3 exhibit increasing trends with increasing SCN− levels  This explains the film color change from black to yellow as seen in Fig  1  The optimized MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x structures were used to generate XRD patterns ( Fig  S3 )  and they were compared to the experimental spectra  A similar decreasing trend of the ( 110 ) plane with increasing SCN− level was observed in both the simulated and the experimental XRD spectra for all five MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x films  Notice that the XRD peak positions of the experimental and the simulated MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x do not exactly match  This could be attributed to the difference in the distribution and/or the position of SCN− moieties in the prepared MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x films and the simulated MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x structures  In the current study  the ( 110 ) plane shifted to a lower angle  which could be due to a unit-cell expansion  The volumes of the optimized MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x structures  which are plotted in Fig  S4  were estimated to clarify this point  The unit-cell volume increases with increasing SCN− concentration  which agrees well with the downward shifting of the ( 110 ) plane  Generally  cell expansion weakens the bond strength in the perovskite structure  causing film degradation  However  Jiang et al  [ 18 ] and Chen et al  [ 19 ] observed the increasing film stability with increasing SCN− incorporation  To explain this film stability  we estimated the hydrogen bonding of the optimized MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x structures  Hydrogen bonds between H ( in MA+ ) and S ( in SCN− ) and/or H ( in MA+ ) and N ( in SCN− ) are detected in all four MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x structures  as illustrated in Fig  4 ( b )  The number of hydrogen bonds and their lengths in each structure were measured  and the results are listed in Table S2  Hydrogen bond formation between SCN− and MA+ will stabilize the MA+ ions  enabling them to remain in the perovskite structure  Hence  the presence of the hydrogen bonds in MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x structures is the key factor in enhancing solar cell stability  as has been reported in previous studies [ 1819 ]  We also tried to prepare MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x films by using a two-step ( spin-dip ) method  but this method produced similar black-colored materials at all five SCN− levels  This could have been due to an unexpected chemFig  5  ( a ) The solar cell architecture of the carbon-based HTL-free MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x perovskite

films when produced via a two-step method  We believed that some SCN− ions diffused out of the PbI2-Pb ( SCN ) 2 film during the dipping process in the MAI solution  Tai et al  observed a low S concentration of 27–84 mol % with respect to I in MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x films prepared using a two-step method [ 17 ]  2  CH3NH3Pb ( SCN ) xI3−x Perovskite Solar Cells MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x films were used as light absorbers  and carbon paste was used as the hole-collecting layer in a hole-transporting-layer ( HTL ) -free perovskite solar cell  The architecture of this low-cost perovskite solar cell consists of FTO/compacted-TiO2/mesoporousTiO2/MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x/carbon film  as shown in Fig  5 ( a )  The solar cell efficiency was determined using a solar simulator at a light intensity of 100 mW/cm2 at 15 AM  The photocurrent-density ( J ) versus photovoltage ( V ) curves of carbon-based HTL free MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x perovskite solar cells are presented in Fig  5 ( b )  The solar cell parameters were derived from the J − V curves and are listed in Table 1  We observed that the J − V curve of MAPbI3 ( x = 0 ) solar cell manifests good solar cell characteristic with a notable efficiency ( η ) of -1216- Journal of the Korean Physical Society  Vol  77  No  12  December 2020 Fig  6  ( a ) PCE  ( b ) Jsc  ( c ) Voc and ( d ) FF versus time ( in days ) of the carbon-based HTL-free MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x perovskite solar cells  456 %  However  SCN− substitution had a negative impact on the solar cell performance  as seen in Table 1  The MAPb ( SCN ) 025I275 solar cell had a lower efficiency of 284 %  even though the films ’ color ( dark ) and its energy bandgap ( Eg = 158 eV ) were very close to the color ( dark ) and the energy bandgap ( Eg = 159 eV ) of MAPbI3  This suggests that other film properties  were also altered by SCN− substitution  ie  the electron-hole diffusion rate  electron-hole diffusion length  and/or the light adsorption coefficient  The changes in these properties still needs further detail clarified  The high SCN− level in MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x perovskites strongly suppresses solar cell performance  Particularly  the MAPb ( SCN ) 2I ( x = 2 ) perovskite solar cell exhibited a poor efficiency of 187 %  This could be attributed to the increase in the bandgap to 237 eV  as seen in Fig  S5  which limited the light absorption range  and to the rough perovskite surface as seen in Fig  2  which consequently minimized the perovskite and carbon film connection  The film and cell reproducibility were tested by assembling four perovskite solar cell devices for each SCN− concentration  The solar cell characteristics ( PCE  Jsc  Voc and FF ) are presented in Fig  S6  The standard deviation ( SD ) of cell efficiencies is highest  ∼05  for MAPbI3-based solar cells  SD values for other conditions are lower than that of the MAPbI3-based solar cells  indicating good solar cell reproduction through these preparation procedures  The stabilities of the best cells for each condition were tested for 30 days by keeping these devices at a relative humanity of 50–60 %  and the results are depicted in Fig  6  The PCE of the pure MAPbI3 perovskite solar cell was found to degrade from the 2nd day onward  from 456 % to 416 %  Alternatively  the efficiencies of the MAPb ( SCN ) 025I275 and MAPb ( SCN ) 05I25 perovskite solar cells on the 2nd day increased compared to their 1st day efficiencies  The efficiencies of the MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x ( x = 1 and 2 ) perovskite solar cells were quite constant over 30 days  After 30 days  the efficiencies had changed by −3421 %  +3944 %  +1140 %  +1148 % and +428 %  respectively  compared to their 1st day values for MAPbI3  MAPb ( SCN ) 025I275  MAPb ( SCN ) 05I250  MAPb ( SCN ) I2 and MAPb ( SCN ) 2I-based solar cells  respectively  The percentage changes in Jsc  Voc  FF and η for the MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x-based solar cells are listed in Table 2  The Jsc of the pure MAPbI3-based solar cell greatly decreased by −3508 % after the 30-day test in comparison to its initial value  This is the main factor affecting the efficiency degradation of the pure MAPbI3-based solar cell  Oppositely  the Jsc of the MAPbSCN025I275-based solar cell slightly decreases ( by −552 % )  and the Jsc of MAPbSCNxI3−x-based ( x = 05  1 and 2 ) solar cells increased  The increasing efficiencies of the MAPbSCNxI3−x ( x = 025  05  1 and 2 ) -based solar cells could be attributed to the more complete drying of the carbon film  and the good stabilities of the MAPbSCNxI3−x ( x = 025  05  1 and 2 ) films  The excellent stabilities of the MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x solar cells can be ascribed to three possible mechanisms  The first is hydrogen bonding between S and H and/or between N and H in the MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x structure  as shown in Fig  4 ( b ) and Table S2  The second is the good moisture resistance of the carbon film [ 24  25 ]  The third is the absence of an unstable hole-transporting layer in the devices  That the solar-cell efficiencies in this work were relatively low compared to these for other reported lowcost perovskite solar cells ( above 10 % ) is notable [ 27 ]  This could be due to two factors  the poor perovskite film quality ( these films were prepared in open air ) and the thick perovskite film ( > 194 um as seen in Fig  2 )  We suggest that optimizing the film ’ s quality and its thickness may further improve the solar-cell efficiencies of these low-cost MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x solar cells  IV  CONCLUSION MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x films were successfully prepared using a hot-casting method  The substitution of SCN− in MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x perovskite structures modifies the films ’ optical properties inducing a color transformation from black to yellow  This is due to an increasing energy bandgap  as evidenced by both the experimental and computational results  The experimental XRD spectra of MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x films show a decreasing angle with a similar trend to that for the simulated tetragonal MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x structures  The carbon-based HTL-free MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x perovskite solar cells produced the highest efficiency  456 %  in a MAPbI3 perovskite solar cell  Although  the SCN− incorporation degraded solar cell efficiency  excellent solar cell stability Calculation and Fabrication of a CH3NH3Pb ( SCN ) xI3−x Perovskite Film ··· – Pantiwa Kumlangwan et al  -1217- was obtained from MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x perovskite solar cells  This is attributed to hydrogen bonding between MA+ and SCN−  The experimental result suggests that the SCN− dopant level at x = 05 is the appropriate ratio for preparing high-efficiency and stable carbon-based HTL-free MAPb ( SCN ) xI3−x perovskite solar cells  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

operation and functionality of a working Bi-based perovskite solar cell device using GPVDM and compared it against a Pb-based device  The results are extremely promising in that they showcase comparable cell efficiencies  with the Bi-based device showing a highest 200 % efficiency ( Jsc of 256 Am-2  Voc of 104 V  FF of 075 ) at 450 nm active layer thickness compared to 234 % of its Pb

 to give its optimal efficiency value  A deeper study of each of the Jsc  Voc and FF trends provide keen insight into charge transfer kinetics within the device  paving the way to optimal experimental setups for fabricating the most efficient non-toxic perovskite devicesIntroduction The photovoltaic community has been captivated by perovskite devices since breakthrough work commenced in 2012  Along with high efficiencies  perovskites boast a high and tunable bandgap  high light absorption coefficient  long diffusion lengths  slow recombination kinetics  high carrier mobility  and importantly  the ability to be processed from solution  thereby allowing low cost  high throughput fabrication at low temperature  and on a variety of substrate types  The rich variety of compositions and the multitude of ways in which they can be investigated have sustained an ever-increasing level of attention in this area  [ 123456 ]  Perovskites typically adopt an ABX3 formulation  where A is the methylammonium ( CH3NH3 ) ( MA ) or formamidinium [ HC ( NH2 ) 2 ] ( FA ) cation  B is commonly lead ( Pb ) and X is a halide ( Cl  Br  I )  This layer is typically sandwiched between an electron transport layer ( ETL )  and a hole transport layer ( HTL ) [ 7  8 ]  A top contact of a transparent conducting oxide  typically fluorine doped tin oxide ( FTO )  and a bottom contact of Ag for ultra-fast conduction of electrons to prevent recombination complete the device circuit  This research focuses on one of the key limiting factors of perovskites : the inclusion of a toxic material - Pb - in its structure  In lieu of Pb  we are using Bismuth ( Bi ) to showcase the full functionality of the cell  Bismuth has been traditionally used in a wide set of applications due to its versatility : in ceramics due to its ferroelectric and electromechanical properties [ 9  10 ]  in various dielectric and energy storage applications [ 11 ]  and in piezoelectric devices and various energy harvesters [ 12 ]  Its properties make it a viable substitute for Pb in the perovskite solar cell architecture as well  Through simulation studies  we have optimized on the active ( perovskite ) layer thickness to give the best efficiency  Critical analyses of solar performance parameters – Short-Circuit Current ( Jsc )  Open Circuit Voltage ( Voc )  and Fill Factor ( FF ) – were done to showcase performance impact as this layer was modulated through a range of thickness values  Importantly  the dependencies of these key parameters as a function of active layer thickness are compared against standard Pb-based perovskite devices that are used as control  These comparisons provide keen insight into charge transfer kinetics within the device  paving the way to optimal experimental setups for fabricating the most efficient non-toxic perovskite devices  We believe this research will have key ramifications on the industrial viability of this technology  11 Simulation methods The General-Purpose Photovoltaic Device Model ( GPVDM ) is a free online platform for simulating photovoltaic behavior  given input parameters ( electrical and optical ) for device layers [ 13 ]  The software has been used successfully in various theoretical and simulation studies and is a well-utilized platform [ 1314151617 ]  The model uses a finite difference approach to solve both electron and hole drift–diffusion equations in position space to describe the movement of charge within the device  At each mesh point in position space  a set of carrier trapping and escape equations are solved in energy space  Recombination can occur by free-to-trap Shockley–Read–Hall ( SRH ) type recombination  SRH theory describes the rates at which electrons and holes become captured and escape from the carrier traps  Charge carriers can give up their energy in collisions with crystals in the film matrix of the active layer  and occupy a lower energy level  thereby becoming ‘ trapped ’ in that level  The trapping of an electron followed by the trapping of a hole completes a recombination process  While details of the modeling can be found in the software package itself and published research where it is utilized [ 1314151617 ]  we provide below the core device physics for the cell functionality  The model uses electronic levels defined as the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energies  and the contacts are considered to consist of planes at x = 0 and x = d where the boundary conditions are applied  Poisson ’ s equation ( Eq  1 ) is used to model the space charge dependent potential profile across the device ; q is the charge on an electron  ε0 the permittivity of free space  εr the relative permittivity of the medium  n the total electron density ( n = nfree + ntrap )  and p the total hole density ( p = pfree + ptrap )  ( 1 ) Furthermore  charge transport in the device is enumerated by the bipolar carrier continuity equations ( Eqs  2 and 3 ) ( ensuring charge conservation in the device ) in 1 D and time space : Here  Jn  p are the electron and hole current flux densities  and R and G are the net recombination and generation rates per unit volume  The carrier balance equation ( Eq  4 ) consolidates the electron and hole capture and escape rate kinetics ; for each trap level  the below equation is solved  thereby giving each trap level an independent quasi-Fermi level  ( 4 ) Here  rate rec describes the rate at which electrons become captured into the electron trap  ree is the rate which electrons can escape from the trap back to the free electron population  rhc is the rate at which free holes get trapped and rhe is the rate at which holes escape back to the free hole population  Lastly  momentum conservation is maintained through the bi-polar drift diffusion equations below : ( 5 ) ( 6 ) Here  where μe and μh are the charge density dependent electron and hole mobilities  and Dn  p are the electron and hole diffusion coefficients  respectively  Figure 1 shows the planar heterojunction architecture of a Bi-based ( non-Pb ) perovskite - CH3NH3BiI3 - solar sell  The layer configuration adopted in this simulation is Glass/FTO/ETL/CH3NH3BiI3/HTL/Ag  where TiO2 is used as the ETL and spiro-OMeTAD is used as the HTL  TiO2 is a good ETL  given its stability  ease of fabrication and high band gap  Spiro-OMeTAD is the most commonly utilized solid-state HTL ; it has improved the performance and viability of perovskite solar cells dramatically by its non-corrosive nature  and by its ability to transport holes effectively to the back-electrode  In our research  as Fig  1 depicts  we have modulated and optimized on the thickness of the perovskite active layer for the best performing device  By changing the active layer thickness  we have effectively modulated the spatial geometry for key performance variables ( electron/hole mobilities  density of states  etc  ) to work in ; the results in turn provide keen insight into how the key solar output parameters – Jsc  Voc  and FF – are impacted  Table 1 shows the key electrical parameters used for the simulation ; the Bi perovskite values were chosen carefully from literature  with multiple sources listing exact values [ 181920212223242526272829 ] ; GPVDM ’ s standard Pb-based perovskite values  together with those for Glass  FTO  TiO2  Spiro and Ag are used here [ 18  29 ]  The thicknesses of Glass ( SiO2 )  FTO contact and Ag contact are set to be 60  100  and 100 nm respectively ; these are standard cell stack values and set as initial values in the softwareResults and discussion In this study  as mentioned earlier  we have focused on the active ( perovskite ) layer  There is a visible trend and peak within the data that signifies the maximum cell efficiency achieved by modulating the thickness of just this layer  Figure 2 illustrates this behavior  while Table 2 lists out the key output parameters of the highest efficiency cells  It is interesting to note that both Bi and Pb based devices show a Gaussian behavior in their trends : while Bi peaks at 200 nm thickness  and falls thereafter  the Pb device – although demonstrating some jitter in data between 450 and 850 nm – produces a maximum efficiency value at 850 nm  after which it tapers offIt is important to showcase that the maximum efficiency for the Bi-based device at 20 % is comparable to the 234 % of the Pb-based device  providing encouragement for a host of research options to pursue to enhance the performance of Bi-based devices  The below discussions on Jsc  Voc and FF kinetics provide further insight into the performance of the two devices  21 Jsc kinetics Figure 3 below shows the Jsc trends for the Bi vs the Pb based device  The Bi and Pb trends almost exactly mimic the overall cell efficiency trends : while the maximum Jsc value for Pb shows a maximum at 850 nm  the Bi device shows a peak at the optimal 450 nm perovskite layer thickness  In general  with increasing film thickness  while more electron–hole pairs are created  defects and recombination centers within the film matrix also increase ; these two competing forces typically lead to a bell-curve trend [ 30  31 ]  This is what we see in Fig  3 as well  While it certainly is plausible that the Pb perovskite ’ s inherent higher electron/hole density of states together with mobility contribute to a better Jsc value than Bi ’ s  the jitter in its data ( especially between 450 and 850 nm ) is indicative of more intricate kinetics going on within the light-absorbing perovskite layer ( compared to Bi )  One of the key improvement realms in the fabrication of both cells should definitely be for fewer defects in the film microstructure22 Voc kinetics Figure 4 below highlights the Voc trends for the Bi versus the Pb-based device  While the Pb-based device shows an initial small rise in trend after which it falls  the Bi cell shows a consistent downward trend ; this is to be expected  In general  the decreasing Voc with increasing thickness dependence is found to derive from two factors ; first  charge recombination sites are distributed throughout the film  enabling more charges to recombine in thicker films before influencing the potential at the electrodes  and second  the average optical power density within the film reduces with increasing film thickness [ 32 ]  As the film thickness varies from 0–1000 nm  it is interesting to observe a few items  Firstly  the Bi-based device has a better Voc value at every thickness than it ’ s Pb counterpart ; secondly  while the Pb perovskite shows a fairly constant Voc  with a gradual decrease with increasing film thickness  the Bi-based device shows a slightly more noticeable change ( decrease ) in the Voc with increasing film thickness  While the band gap of Bi perovskite ( 13 eV ) can explain its intrinsic advantage over Pb perovskite ( 15 eV ) in having higher optical power density within the cell by alPerovskite-sensitized solar cells-based Ga–TiO2 nanodiatom-like photoanode : the improvement of performance by perovskite crystallinity refinementAbstract The structure and crystallinity of the photoactive materials in solar cell determines the exciton formation  carrier ’ s recombination  life-time and transportation in the devices  Here  we report that enhanced charge transportation  internal quantum efficiency and the carrier life-time can be achieved by modifying the structure  morphology of the organic perovskite thin film  enabling the improvement of the solar cell performance  The thin film structure modification was achieved via a thermal annealing in vacuum  In typical procedure  the power conversion efficiency of the PSC device can be upgraded from 05 to 29 %  which is approximately 6 times increment  when the surface structure disorders are limited in the organic perovskite thin film  By optimizing the organic perovskite loading on the Ga–TiO2 diatom-like nanostructures photoanode and combining with a fine control of organic perovskite thin film structure  power conversion efficiency as high as 658 % can be generated from the device  Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and current–voltage analysis in the dark indicated that this process has effectively augmented the carrier life-time and limited the carrier recombination  enhancing the overall performance of the solar cell device  The preparation process and mechanism of the device performance improvement will be discussedIntroduction Organometallic perovskite has been receiving a growing interest in the solar cell application due to its excellent electrical  optical and photovoltaic properties [ 123 ]  Unusually high performance in organic based solar cell has been reported using this material [ 4 ]  Recently  the applicability of perovskite as sensitizer in DSSCs has also been attempted to be obtained [ 5 ]  Combination of excellent intrinsic properties of perovskite and the simplicity of DSSCs fabrication offers promising alternative for producing low-cost and high-performance solar cell system  Therefore  intensive study should be continuously demonstrated on using the perovskites as sensitizer in the DSSC  Like dye  the perovskite in perovskite-sensitized solar cell ( PSC ) is also made into contact with the TiO2 photoactive materials  The perovskite layer properties  such as the crystallinity  compactness  defect  etc  then determines the overall performance of the PSC  Perovskite layer with high-degree of crystallinity  compactness and low-defect density may generate active photoexcitation and facile carrier transport in the PSC device [ 1 ]  The improvement of organic perovskite stability by thermal annealing has also been reported  The removal of CH3NH3Cl and the formation of pore free structure in the perovskite thin film have been recognized to be the key reason for the enhancement of the stability [ 6  7 ]  Thin film structure of the photoactive materials play a prominent effect on the performance of the solar cell device [ 8  9 ]  Surface morphology and disorder in the films structure are a critical reason for low-performance solar cell device [ 101112 ]  Improvement of surface morphology and structure enables facile exciton formation and separation  improvement of carrier life-time and transport in the device  Thermal annealing has been widely used in large range of materials for improvement of crystallinity  electrical and optical properties as well as mechanical properties [ 13  14 ]  For example  the application of thermal annealing on the ZnO or TiO2 system has significantly influenced the level of the oxygen vacancies and the carrier concentration in these materials [ 15161718 ]  It also enhances the electrical properties due to the decreasing of structural defect in the materials [ 19  20 ]  Recently  we developed PSC device utilizing methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite ( MLIP ) and Ga–TiO2 nanodiatom-like structure ( Ga–TiO2 NDs ) [ 5 ]  Combinative effect of perovskite sensitization and peculiar electrical and optical properties of metal-doped TiO2 [ 21 ] ( Ga–TiO2 NDs ) has successfully produced high-efficiency perovskite-sensitized solar cell  In this paper  we investigated the evolution of MLIP sensitizer layer structure on the Ga–TiO2 NDs under a thermal annealing in order to obtain an optimum condition for a high-performance PSC device  It was found that the MLIP layer underwent a facile refinement in its film morphology and crystallinity under only a small change in the annealing temperature  Highly-compact thin film structure with low-defect density can be obtained and this leads to the generation of PSC device with efficiency as high as 658 %  The refinement of the MLIP film crystallinity is considered as the main factor for the improvement of the PSC device performance [ 22 ]  2 Experimental 21 Synthesis and characterization of Ga-doped TiO2 nanodiatom-like structure ( Ga–TiO2 NDs ) and methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite ( MLIP )  Ga–TiO2 NDs was prepared by using our previously reported method [ 232425 ]  namely via a liquid phase deposition method at room temperature utilizing the optimum reaction condition  Briefly  the Ga–TiO2 NDs on ITO substrate was prepared by immersing a clean ITO substrate into a growth solution that contains 5 mL of 05 M ( NH4 ) 2 TiF6 ammonium hexafluorotitanate ( 99 wt %  sigma - Aldrich )  5 mL of 10 M ( H3BO3 ) boric acid ( 98 wt %  Sigma–Aldrich )  and gallium nitrate ( Ga ( NO3 ) 3  The concentration of ( Ga ( NO3 ) 3 was 025 %  The growth time and temperature are 15 h and room temperature ca  25 °C  respectively  After growth  the samples were annealed at 400 °C for l h The MLIP was prepared by using our recently reported procedure  Briefly  methylamine iodide ( CH3NH3I ) was firstly prepared by adding methylamine ( 278 mL in methanol 40 % ) to hydroiodic acid ( 278 mL  57 wt % in water )  The solution was then evaporated  producing methylamine iodide ( CH3NH3I ) powder  The product was washed with diethyl ether and dried under vacuum  The MLI perovskite was then obtained by mixing 035 g of methylammonium iodide with 115 g of PbI2 in 20 mL dimethylformamide  The reaction was left overnight under stirring at 700 rpm at 60 °C  The thin film of MLIP was then prepared on Ga–TiO2 NDs by simply immersing the ITO substrate containing the Ga–TiO2 NDs into the MLIP solution for 5 h The Ga–TiO2 NDs-coated MLIP samples were then annealed in a vacuum oven  In order to evaluating the effect of film annealing on the structural evolution and properties of MLIP on the Ga–TiO2 NDs  the annealing temperature was varied from 50 to 97 °C  The annealing time was for 30 min  Un-annealed sample was not evaluated because during the process of MLIP film preparation all the samples were subjected to heat treatment to evaporate any organic solvent in the film  In addition  it is not stable and easily disintegrated upon being contacted with the electrolytes  Thus  the device fabrication is not possible  MLIPs with different concentrations  ie  from 02 to 10 M  were also prepared to evaluate the effectiveness of thermal annealing effect in thin film crystallinity at relatively thick MLIP and the PSC device performance at different MLIP loading  The SUPRA55VP field emission scanning electron microscopy ( FESEM ) and an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ( EDX ) were used to study the morphologies and the structures of the Ga–TiO2 NDs and the chemical composition of the sample  respectively  X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) spectroscopy was carried out to examine the crystallinity phase of the sample using a Bruker D8 Discover with Cu-Kα radiation ( k = 15406 Ǻ ) with a scan rate of 20°/min  Meanwhile  photoluminescence characterization was performed using photoluminescence spectrophotometer  model FLS920 Edinburgh Instrument  UK  with excitation wavelength of 470 nm  22 Perovskite-sensitized solar cell ( PSC ) fabrication and characterization PSC device with structure of ITO/Ga–TiO2 NDs /perovskite/ electrolyte/Pt was fabricated to examine the relationship between the MLIP film structural properties and the PSC device performance  Briefly  the PSC device was prepared by simply clamping together the MLI/Ga–TiO2 NDs-coated ITO and Pt counter electrode film-coated ITO  Platinum counter electrode was prepared using our previously reported method for metal nanoparticles thin film growth on the substrate  ie  seed-mediated growth method [ 26272829303132 ]  Liquid electrolytes of iodide/triiodide couple was then injected into the space between them  We used a parafilm layer with thickness of 02 mm as a spacer between the MLIP/ Ga–TiO2 NDs and the Pt counter electrode  The active area of the cell was 025 cm2  The J–V characteristics of the PSC device was then evaluated under irradiation of a Sun-simulated light source AM15 ( 100 mW/cm2 )  provided by the 150-W Newport low-cost solar simulator  using a Keithley high-voltage source-measure unit ( SMU ) model 237  Meanwhile  the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS ) analysis of the samples were performed using a Solartron 1260 system in a frequency range of 001–1 MHz  applied bias of 004 V and alternating current amplitude of 50 mA  3 Results and discussion Figure 1 shows the typical FESEM and TEM images  XRD spectrum and the elemental analysis results of the Ga–TiO2 nanodiatom ( Ga–TiO2 NDs ) prepared in this experiment  Similar to our previously reported result 5  the anatase Ga–TiO2 NDs film  as confirmed by the XRD analysis in Fig  1b  was constructed by a compact takraw ball-like nanodiatom ( Fig  1a )  Meanwhile  as verified by the HRTEM analysis  its bulk structure is composed of fibrous Ga–TiO2 ( 001 ) facetted nanowires with diameter and length of approximately 15 and 100 nm  respectively ( Fig  1c  d )  The average thickness of the Ga–TiO2 NDs film is 5 µm  The EDX analysis result further demonstrates that the nanodiatom is Ga doped TiO2 ( Fig  1b ) with an even distribution of Ga dopant inside the TiO2 nanostructures ( Fig  1e )  Fig  1 figure 1 FESEM images of Ga–TiO2 NDs ( a )  ( b ) XRD spectra of Ga–TiO2 NDs with Ga doping of 0025 M Low ( c ) and high ( d ) resolution transmission electron microscopy image of inner structure of Ga–TiO2 NDs  e EDX elemental analysis result of Ga–TiO2 NDs samplelowing more photons ( density ) to be captured  the recombination kinetics again seem to play a role in the Bi-based device as the film thickness increases and the Voc tapers down3 FF kinetics Figure 5 below shows the FF trends for the Bi vs the Pb based device  Qualitatively speaking  the FF is an indication of how effectively electron–hole pairs transport through the cell without loss ( like recombination )  The FF trends show a stark difference between the two materials : while the Pb-based cell shows a minimal degradation in FF values with film thickness  the Bi-based cell shows a drastic fall  It appears that this behavior is in line with our observations and conclusions from the Jsc and Voc trends : Bi-based cells exhibit more intrinsic defects and recombination centers than their Pb-based counterpartsConclusions We have simulated the operation and functionality of a working Bi-based perovskite solar cell device using GPVDM and compared it against a Pb-based device  The results are extremely promising in that they showcase comparable cell efficiencies  with the Sn-based device showing a highest 200 % efficiency ( Jsc of 256 A/m2  Voc of 104 V  FF of 075 ) at 450 nm active layer thickness compared to 234 % of its Pb counterpart ( Jsc of 3493 A/m2  Voc of 081 V  FF of 083 ) at 850 nm active layer thickness  The Bi-based device can thus be manufactured at approximately half its Pb-counterpart active layer thickness  to give its optimal efficiency value  A deeper study of each of the Jsc  Voc and FF kinetics reveal that Bi-based devices could perform better by reducing the defect density/recombination centers within the film matrixThe MLIP film has been successfully deposited onto the Ga–TiO2 NDs surface via a dipping method  Their elemental composition has been confirmed by the EDX analysis results as shown in Fig  2  As can be seen from the EDX spectrum  the elements of Pb and I exist  inferring the organic perovskite has successfully formed on the surface of Ga–TiO2 NDs  The present EDX spectrum agrees well with that obtained in our previous study [ 5 ]  XRD analysis ( discussed later ) is also further verified the formation of MLIP  Fig  2 figure 2 EDX spectrum for methylammonium lead iodide perovskite Full size image PSC device with structure of ITO/ Ga–TiO2 NDs-MLIP/electrolyte/Pt/ITO was then fabricated  The J–V curve for the PSC device utilizing MLIP annealed under different temperatures from 50 to 97 °C under simulated AM 15G irradiation is shown in Fig  3  The photovoltaic parameters of the PSC are recorded in Table 1  Generally mentioning  the J–V hysteresis little bit different compared to normal DSSC devices  which is quasi-square in shape  This could be assumed as the phenomenon of unique excitation and transport mechanism in the perovskite materials that leads to this anomalous J–V hysteresis curve [ 33 ]  Despite this unusual phenomenon  as can be seen from the figure and table  it is found that the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) increased with the increasing of annealing temperature and optimum at 90 °C  At this stage  PCE as high as 29 % is obtained  If we look at Table 1  the improvement of PCE is merely due to the enhancement of the current density ( Jsc ) in the device upon being annealed  Meanwhile  insignificant modification in the Voc upon thermal annealing was observed  Such phenomenon is certainly an indication of carrier transport improvement in the device upon thermal annealing treatment [ 1  25 ]  However  the PCE does not further improve  but instead decreases when the annealing temperature further increases from this optimum condition  This could be due to MLIP film structure degradation under high-temperature annealing ( will be discussed later )  Fig  3 figure 3 ( J–V ) characteristics of perovskite-sensitized solar cell ( PSC ) under different annealing temperatures Full size image Table 1 Photovoltaic parameters for PSC devices utilizing Ga–TiO2 NDs as photoanode Full size table The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectrum for perovskite device is shown in Fig  4  As can be seen from the figure  the PSC device exhibits excellent photosensitivity in the region of 300–800 nm as its high photocurrent generation in this region  As also can be seen from the figure  the EQE agree well with the J–V curve characteristic  where the photocurrent density increase with increasing of annealing temperature and maximum for the sample annealed at 90 °C  EQE as high as higher than 90 % is obtained from the optimum device  Fig  4 figure 4 The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectrum for PSC device annealed at different temperatures Full size image The improvement in the performance of the device could be due to several factors including  the enhancement of carrier transport  recombination restriction and advancement of interfacial charge transfer in the device [ 34 ]  We carried out electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis on the samples  The results are shown in Fig  5  As can be seen from the figure  the charge transfer resistance ( Rct )  which is attributed to the charge transfer process at the interface between Ga–TiO2 NDs/perovskite layer/electrolyte  decrease with the increasing of the annealing temperature  As expected  the Rct is the lowest for the sample that has been annealed at 90 °C  inferring a facile charge transfer in the device [ 35 ] ; thus  enhancing the device performance  In order to find the nature of electron–hole recombination and carrier life-time in the PSC device  we carried out the Bode frequency plot analysis  The results are shown in Fig  5b  As can be seen from the figure  the maximum frequency response of the device decreases with the increasing of annealing temperature  Because the carrier life-time is the inverse of the frequency  this reflects that the increasing of the annealing temperature improves the carrier life-time  hence  the performance of the device  By using a standard equation for carrier life-time  it was found that the optimum sample ( annealed at 90 °C ) exhibits carrier life-time as high as 8 ms  The life-time decreases with the decreasing of annealing temperature of the device ( see Table 1 )  Such long carrier life-time is corroborated by the obtained high-value of device quantum capacitance [ 36 ]  which reflects the density of states of electrons that is accumulated in the electron-transporting material TiO2 [ 37 ]  For the sample annealed at 90 °C  the quantum capacitance is the highest  namely 190 µF  It then decreases gradually when the annealing temperature used decrease or increasing above the optimum annealing temperature  For example  the quantum capacitance is only 422 or 395 µF for the sample annealed at 50 or 97 °C  respectively ( see Table 1 )  The existence of life-time and quantum capacitance enhancement upon being annealed renders reducing the recombination in the device and improving the device capability to hold carriers for a longer time [ 36 ]  This leads to enhancement of the charge transportation in the device ( τCT  see Table 1 )  Thus  current density enhances  As have been mentioned earlier  the Voc of the device did not change significantly upon variation of the annealing temperature  This is an indication of no modification on the exciton generation during the photoexcitation in the device that annealed under different annealing temperatures  Unfortunately  the present performance can not be compared to the as prepared sample  As have been mentioned earlier  it is due to the stability issue of the perovskite film which easily disintegrates upon contact with the electrolyte  hence the fabrication of the device is not possible  Fig  5 figure 5 EIS spectra of the PSC device annealed under annealing temperature ( a )  Nyquist plot  b Bode plots over frequency range 10 Hz–1 MHz Full size image The nature of electron–hole recombination can also be understood from the photoluminescence analysis results  The PL result of MLIP film on Ga–TiO2 NDs is shown in Fig  6  As can be seen from Fig  6  the PL peaks at wavelength of 600 to 650 nm gradually decreases with the increasing of annealing temperature treatment on the device  The decay of the PL intensity with the increasing of annealing temperature indicates that the excitons is dissociated into free electrons and holes at the interface before the radiation recombination occurs [ 38 ]  The PL peaks intensity at this wavelength region  which associated with the MLIP PL peak  the lowest at the optimum sample and drastically increased when the annealing temperature increases above the optimum condition  Because the PL peaks intensity reflects the electron–hole recombination activity  it can be worthwhile concluded that the sample annealed at 90 °C features a low electron–hole recombination process  Thus  it may produce high-performance solar cell device  Fig  6 figure 6 Photoluminescence spectra of perovskites grown on Ga–TiO2 NDs annealed at different annealing temperatures  ie  50 ( a )  60 ( b )  70 ( c )  80 ( d )  90 ( e ) and 97 °C ( f ) Full size image In order to obtain a better understanding on the reason of the performance improvement upon annealing process  we carried out FESEM analysis to collect the information regarding the structural refinement both at the surface and the bulk structure of the MLIP due to the annealing process  The result is shown in Fig  7  As can be seen from the figure  the sample annealed at 50 °C ( Fig  2a ) exhibits an incompact structure with clear appearance of MLIP crystals  generating highly in-homogeneous MLIP films  And also  the MLIP crystal was also randomly oriented  Such condition would be vulnerable to carrier trap as the existence of large interface resistance and defect density  When the sample was subjected to a thermal annealing at 60 °C  there is a significant refinement on the film structure noticed  The MLIP film structure was observed to improve and their crystalline orientation was also start to align into a single direction  which renders the decreasing of defect density and interface resistance due to stacking fault  The structure of MLIP film further improves with the increasing of annealing temperature and optimum at 90 °C  At this stage  the MLIP exhibits very fine structure with high compactness and less defect density  Phase transformation via sublimation during thermal annealing treatment is believed to be the driving force for the improvement of perovskite thin film crystallinity  This is in good agreement with earlier report by Graetzel et al  [ 6 ]  However  when the annealing temperature was further increased to 97 °C  the film structure experienced a drastic reorganization that caused a structure disorder probably due to an enhanced surface tension at high annealing temperature  While  FESEM analysis indicates the existence of strong relationship between the annealing temperature and the surface topology  the cross-section analysis also shows the same tendency where the bulk structure is also refined with the increasing of annealing temperature and optimum for the sample annealed at 90 °C  An increase in the perovskite stability upon thermal annealing can also be associated with the improvement of PSC device performance [ 7 ]  Based on this result  it is worthwhile to remark that the increase in the structural order in the MLIP film leads to improvement of carrier transport and charge transfer in the device ; thus  enhancing the PSC performance  Fig  7 figure 7 FESEM images of Ga–TiO2 NDs covered with perovskite film and annealed in vacuum at 50 ( a )  60 ( b )  70 ( c )  80 ( d )  90 ( e )  and 97 °C ( f )  The scales bars are 2 µm Full size image In good agreement with the FESEM analysis result that indicates a notable evolution of MLIP film morphology upon annealing  the XRD analysis result as shown in Fig  8 reveals a significant crystalline phase refinement due to the annealing process  As has been obtained previously  the characteristic XRD spectrum of MLIP with diffraction peaks at 2θ of 2359  2456  2824  2852  3194  4035  4322 and 5025° ( which can be associated with the diffraction from ( 211 )  ( 202 )  ( 004 )  ( 213 )  ( 224 )  ( 314 ) and ( 404 ) perovskite Bragg planes  respectively )  and the peak intensity are determined by the crystallite size and the phase crystallinity [ 39 ]  In the present study  it is found that the phase crystallinity of the MLIP films likely improves with the thermal annealing treatment where it increases with the increasing of annealing temperature  It is reflected by the improvement of the diffraction peaks at particular perovskite Bragg plane  As expected  in this case  the highest-phase crystallinity was demonstrated by the sample annealed at 90 °C  Scherer analysis then further validates the improvement of the crystallinity as the increasing of the crystallite size upon increasing of annealing temperature and maximum at the sample annealed at 90 °C ( see Table 1 )  This result further underpins the reason behind the high-performance of the PSC device at this condition  The phase crystallinity then decreases when the annealing temperature increased from the optimum condition ( ca  97 °C )  At this condition  the MLIP might decompose forming PbI2 in the film structure ( curve F in Fig  4 )  This may lead to the increasing of carrier-trap site in the film  reducing the carrier mobility [ 40 ]  Such deficient effect of excess PbI2 in the perovskite layers on the carrier mobility has also been reported recently by Jacobsson and Hagfeldt [ 41 ]  Fig  8 figure 8 XRD spectra of MLIP film annealed at different temperatures in vacuum Full size image While the performance of the PSC device can be improved by refining the structure and surface morphology of the MLIP thin film  we attempted to further increase the performance of the PSC device by improving the MLIP loading on the Ga–TiO2 NDs photoanode  By applying similar annealing approach onto the MLIP thin film with higher dye loading  we found that the PCE of the PSC device can be increased by increasing the MLIP loading on the Ga–TiO2 NDs and maximum at the sample prepared utilizing MLIP with concentration of 08 M The PCE is as high as 658 % with Jsc and Voc of as high as 36 mA cm− 2 and 06 V  respectively  However  the performance decreased when the concentration of MLIP further increased  This could be related to the increasing of transportation length upon the increasing of MLIP loading  Thus  lower current is extracted from the device  EIS analysis shows such phenomena by presenting a decreasing in the carrier life-time when high MLIP loading used in the device  The results are shown in Fig  9 and Table 2  Fig  9 figure 9 J–V characteristics of PSC device with different concentrations of MLIP Full size image Table 2 Photovoltaic parameters devices of Ga–TiO2 NDs perovskite with different concentrations of MLIP and annealed at 90 °C for 30 min Full size table It is true that the present Voc and FF value is relatively lower than the currently reported result  It is due to un-optimized interfacial characteristic of the device  which is arisen from the device fabrication issue  It is well known that the improvement of the optoelectronic properties of the material will lead to the increasing of both Voc and fill factor  However  because the carrier loss at the interface is still high as a consequence of such an un-optimized device fabrication  both Voc and FF become small  We believe that the performance of the device will be much enhanced when the issue is solved  The attempt for the improvement of the interface characteristic of the device is being pursued  4 Conclusions The effect of thermal annealing on the methyl ammonium iodide perovskite ( MLIP ) crystallinity  electrical  optical and photovoltaic properties has been evaluated  It was found that the carrier life-time  charge transportation and internal quantum efficiency of the PSC device enhanced up to multiple orders upon thermal annealing at mild temperature in vacuum  In typical procedure  the power conversion efficiency of the PSC device can be upgraded from 05 to 29 % when the thermal annealing was applied to the MLIP film  Optimizing the MLIP loading onto the Ga–TiO2 NDs and at the same time keeping the crystallinity properties at its optimum condition  power conversion efficiency as high as 658 % can be achieved from the PSC device  The phase crystallinity refinement and defect density reduction upon thermal annealing are assumed as the main reason for the improvement of the PSC performance  It is true that the present PSC device performance is much inferior compared to the recently reported performance of perovskite-based solar cell  However  the present study demonstrates a general description on the relationship between the properties of organic perovskite and the photon to current conversion efficiency in a DSSC device  The effort to improve the performance is underway  ReferencesMaterials requirements for improving the electron transport layer/perovskite interface of perovskite solar cells determined via numerical modelingEnhanced Photovoltaic Performance of Perovskite Solar Cells by Copper Chloride ( CuCl2 ) as an

carbon-based  lead-free AgBiI4 Rudorffite solar cell with HCl as an additive Article 16 February 2024 1 Introduction The power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) has been lifted from 38 % to over 20 % within few years due to their favorable optoelectronic properties such as-high absorption coefficient  long diffusion length  high charge carrier mobility  tunable optical band gaps  ambipolar charge transport [ 1234567 ]  Beside their optimistic properties  rapid research progress in facial fabrication methods leading to uniform and crystalline perovskite films contributes to their significant achievement in PCEs [ 8  9 ]  One of the simplest and the most effective way to obtain high quality perovskite absorber layer for PSCs is additive engineering [ 10111213 ]  Successful additive engineering methods for high efficiency PSCs have been obtained by various additives such as metallic chlorides  organic molecules  inorganic or ammonium salts  polymers  ionic liquids etc  [ 1415161718 ]  One step anti-solvent method has been widely used for the fabrication of high quality perovskite layer with two solvents such as N  N-dimethylfomamide ( DMF ) and dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) in the perovskite precursor [ 19 ]  However for large scale fabrication in commercial aspects a single solvent with medium boiling point for the perovskite precursor is more beneficial  Frolova et al  have used DMF as medium boiling point single solvent for CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution and showed low PCE of 94 % by anti-solvent method  Further enhancement of PCE up to 13 % was observed with 10 mol % HgI2 addition in the CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution [ 20 ]  Hence  by combining the two beneficial aspects of additive engineering and anti-solvent method together might be beneficial to produce high quality perovskite films for efficient PSCs  In this letter  we have introduced CuCl2 as an additive in the CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution with DMF as the solvent to obtain high quality perovskite films prepared by anti-solvent method  We have varied the concentration of CuCl2 from 0 to 15 mol % in the CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution and observed the structural and optoelectronic properties of the corresponding CH3NH3PbI3 films  PSCs optimized by addition of 25 mol % CuCl2 showed the best PCE of 1522 % with short circuit

detergent  de-ionized water and ethanol sequentially for 15 min each and ultraviolet ( UV ) /ozone treated for 30 min  The NiOx layer was sprayed on to the cleaned FTO substrate ( Ni ( acac ) 2 : Mg ( CH3COO ) 2·4H2O ( 95:5 % V )  in acetonitrile/ethanol ) at 500 °C and annealed for 15 min  12 M CH3NH3PbI3 was prepared for pristine perovskite film  For CH3NH3PbI3·zCuCl2  CuCl2 was added in CH3NH3I/PbI2 with molar ratio of 1 ( CH3NH3I ) : 1 ( PbI2 ) : z ( CuCl2 ) ( where z was varied from 125 to 15 mol % ) in 1 mL DMF  The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated onto the substrate at 5000 rpm and after 12 s spinning  100 µL of toluene was quickly dripped on the substrate and annealed at 100 °C for 30 min in N2 glove box  Consequently  PCBM ( 20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene ) and BCP ( solution in methanol ) were spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 30 s and 6000 rpm for 30 s respectively  Finally  a 90 nm thick silver electrode layer was thermally evaporated under 465 × 10−6 Pa vacuum through a shadow mask with an active area of 009 cm2  23 Characterization Optical absorbance spectra were measured by a UV–Vis ( Shimadzu UV/Vis 3600 ) spectrophotometer  The surface morphology of perovskite films was observed by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) ( JSM-6500F )  The XRD was measured on a Rigaku RINT-2500 powder X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation  The J–V characteristics were measured using a solar simulator with AM 15 sunlight ( 100 mW cm−2  WXS-155S-10 : Wacom Denso Co  Japan )  The J–V curves were measured by forward ( − 02 to 12 V ) scan by using the Keithley 2400  J–V curves for all devices were measured by masking the cells with a metal mask 009 cm2 in area  The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency ( IPCE ) spectra were measured with a monochromatic incident light of 1 × 1016 photons cm−2 in direct current mode ( CEP-2000BX  Bunko-keiki )  Steady-state photoluminescence ( PL ) was recorded by a spectrometer ( Spectra Pro-300i ) with an excitation by an Ar+ laser of wavelength 5145 nm ( Stabilite 2017 )  3 Results and Discussion The surface morphology of CH3NH3PbI3 films at different concentration of CuCl2 are shown in Fig  1  As illustrated in Fig  1a without CuCl2 addition  the CH3NH3PbI3 film showed inhomogeneous grains due to fast crystallization resulting from DMF  For the CH3NH3PbI3 film formed by addition of 125 mol % CuCl2  few larger grains in the range of 09–12 µm have been recorded ( Fig  1b )  With increased CuCl2 concentration in the precursor solution of 25 mol %  the corresponding CH3NH3PbI3 films resulted in homogeneous grains with average size of 07 µm ( Fig  1c )  This is because  the addition of CuCl2 in the precursor solution provide chloride ions which leads to the formation of intermediate phase eventually acting as seeds and promotes the growth of larger perovskite grains [ 21 ]  With further increment of CuCl2 concentration up to 5 mol %  the morphology of CH3NH3PbI3 film was similar to 25 mol % CuCl2 films but showed small pores within the CH3NH3PbI3 film ( Fig  1d )  The pore sizes were increased and the uncovered film morphology was observed at 10 and 15 mol % CuCl2 concentration ( Fig  1e  f )  Fig  1 figure 1 SEM images of CH3NH3PbI3 films : a pristine  b 125 mol %  c 25 mol %  d 5 mol %  e 10 mol % and f 15 mol % of CuCl2 additive Full size image The performance of PSCs is directly dependent on the crystallinity of perovskite films [ 15  22 ]  Figure 2a shows the XRD pattern of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films without and with CuCl2 addition at different concentration  All the resulting films showed XRD peaks located at 142°  285° and 319° corresponding to the 110  220 and 310 crystal planes respectively for the tetragonal perovskite phase ( space group I4/m cm ) [ 23242526 ]  From the XRD observation  we found that the intensity of the ( 110 ) peak at 2θ = 142° varied with CuCl2 concentration in the precursor solution  The sample with 125 mol % CuCl2 addition showed twice higher intensity and sharper peak as compared with pristine CH3NH3PbI3  indicating improved crystallinity and larger crystallite size [ 27 ]  As the full width at half maximum of the diffraction peaks are inversely proportional to the crystallite size [ 28 ]  This result is also consistent with the SEM images observation  With the addition of CuCl2 beyond 125 mol %  the XRD intensity gradually decreased  For the perovskite films with 5–15 mol % CuCl2  an extra peak at 126° was observed which can be assigned to the peak of PbI2  indicating incomplete crystallization of perovskite film due to presence of excess CuCl2 [ 8 ]  Figure 2 ( b ) shows the PL spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3 films with 25 mol % CuCl2 and without CuCl2 addition  The perovskite film without CuCl2 showed relatively weak PL intensity at 774 nm whereas  the PL emission from the CH3NH3PbI3 with 25 mol % CuCl2 was more intense on the order of ~ 5  These results indicate a significant reduction in non-radiative recombination due to the formation of high quality crystals  eventually leading to lower trap states with the addition of 25 mol % CuCl2 [ 29  30 ]  Fig  2 figure 2 a XRD pattern of CH3NH3PbI3 films at different concentration of CuCl2  b PL spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 films of pristine and 25 mol % CuCl2  deposited on the soda-lime glass substrate Full size image All the PSCs were fabricated in FTO/NiOX/CH3NH3PbI3·zCuCl2/PCBM/BCP/Ag configuration  The IPCE spectra for the PSCs as a function of CuCl2 concentration in the corresponding precursor solutions are shown in Fig  3a and summarized in Table 1  The onset of the IPCE at 800 nm is consistent with the UV–vis light absorption of CH3NH3PbI3 which is shown in supporting information ( Fig  S1 )  The pristine device showed poor IPCE of 60 % at 590 nm wavelength  Whereas  the PSCs formed by addition of 25 and 5 mol % CuCl2 in the CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solutions showed highest IPCE of 76 % at 590 nm wavelength  The increased IPCE from the pristine device is due to the large and homogeneous grains structures which enhances the charge recombination resistance due to a decease in trap states which is in agreement with the PL observation  When the amount of CuCl2 exceeds beyond 5 mol %  reduced pattern in the IPCE spectra is observed ( 40–60 % at 15 mol % CuCl2 )  From the SEM images  we observed that the addition of CuCl2 increases the grain size resulting in reduced grain boundaries  This is why PSCs fabricated with 25–5 mol % CuCl2 in CH3NH3PbI3 films showed higher IPCE values  As the addition of CuCl2 was increased beyond 5 mol %  the lack of surface coverage by perovskite films results in lower IPCE in the respective PSCs  Fig  3 figure 3Figure 3b shows J–V curves for the PSCs fabricated using perovskite films with different concentration of CuCl2 and the corresponding photovoltaic performance parameters are summarized in Table 1  The PSC without additive exhibits PCE of 973 % with the JSC of 1376 mA/cm2  VOC of 0980 V  and FF of 072  With the addition of CuCl2 in perovskite precursor solution from 125 to 5 mol %  all the performance parameters of corresponding devices improved ( Table 1 )  The PSC with 25 mol % CuCl2 in the precursor solution  showed the best PCE of 1522 %  with VOC of 1022 V  and FF of 0828  As compared with the pristine PSC  the 25 mol % CuCl2 addition improved the JSC and FF from 1376 to 1799 mA/cm2 and 0722 to 0828 respectively  4 Conclusion In this work  we demonstrated the decisive effect of CuCl2 addition on the morphology and optoelectronic properties of CH3NH3PbI3 film from a single precursor solvent  Higher charge recombination resistance due to reduced trap states via CuCl2 addition was observed in the perovskite films with an optimized 25 mol % CuCl2 concentration in the precursor solution  We obtained high PCE of 1522 % with the addition of 25 mol % CuCl2 which is 56 % higher than the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 based PSC  Hence  this work might be a pathway to obtain high quality perovskite films from a single solvent for large scale productionHighly reproducible perovskite solar cells via controlling the morphologies of the perovskite thin films by the solution-processed two-step methodAbstract Organic–inorganic halide perovskites are one of the most attractive materials for the next generation solar cells  The PCE has rapidly increased to more than 22 % using different configurations and techniques and further developments are predicted  However  perovskite solar cells suffer from fabrication reproducibility mainly due to difficulty in controlling the morphology of the perovskite films themselves  In this paper we present a low temperature solution-processed two-step deposition method to fabricate CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites  This method offers a simple route with great potential in fabricating reproducible perovskite solar cells  In the present work  we demonstrate that the morphology of the perovskite thin films is highly determined by the concentration of Methylammonium iodide ( MAI ) as well as the reaction time between MAI and PbI2  High-performance solar cells have been reproducibly achieved with a highest PCE of 1501 % for PCBM-based planar heterojunction solar cells  Similar content being viewed by others Fabrication of efficient planar perovskite solar cells using

CH3NH3PbI3 from Electrodeposited PbO for Highly Efficient Planar Perovskite Solar Cells Article Open access 29 October 2015 1 Introduction Organometallic halide perovskites have received significant interests in the last few years due to their superior optical and electrical properties  They demonstrated highly efficient capability of converting light into electricity with low-cost precursors and inexpensive solution-processed methods in fabricating the solar cells [ 1234567 ]  Power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of perovskite solar cells has considerably soared from 38 % in 2009 [ 8 ] to the certified efficiency of 227 % in 2018 [ 9 ]  Studied perovskites solar cells were based on two types of typical device architectures  one type is based on TiO2 [ 101112131415 ] films and the other is based on phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) planar heterojunction ( PHJ ) [ 1617181920 ]  In order to achieve solar cells with high PCE  controlling the morphology of the perovskite thin films is one of the major challenges  In the published literature  perovskite films were produced by various methods  which include vacuum thermal deposition and solution-processed deposition by either one-step or two-step methods  Using the latter method  high-quality perovskite films were obtained utilising both approaches  with solar cells achieving high PCE  On the other hand  the major obstacle to the thermal evaporation method is ascribed to the high-cost of vacuum systems as well as its complicated processes  Furthermore  in order to control the morphology of the perovskite thin films in the one-step solution-processing method  two main routes were utilised ; ( i ) by adding additives into the precursor solution of the perovskites  and ( ii ) by employing the so-called solvent engineering technology [ 21 ]  Nevertheless  it was found that uniform morphologies are difficult to be re-produced in the one-step method owing to their uncontrollable crystallisation rate during the fabrication process [ 22 ]  Therefore  the two-step method has been widely adopted as an efficient technique to control the morphology of the perovskite layer for both TiO2-based and the PCBM-based perovskite solar cells  This is mainly ascribed to the ability to selectively controlling the concentration in one of the precursors  and therefore controlling their reaction and crystallisation rates  For the TiO2-based perovskite solar cells  different techniques were applied to control the morphologies including vapor-assisted solution-processing [ 23 ]  halide sources mixing method [ 24 ]  low-temperature gas–solid crystallisation processes [ 25 ]  solution chemistry engineering [ 26 ]  anti-solvent vapour-assisted crystallisation processes [ 27 ]  and two-step ultrasonic spray deposition method [ 28 ]  Those methods however are complicated and may be expensive in some cases  although high-performance solar cells were obtained utilising one or another of the above highlighted methods  Furthermore  the TiO2 layer has to be sintered at temperatures around 500 °C [ 2 ]  adding further difficulty to the processing of reliable TiO2-based solar cells  Alternatively  the two-step fabrication method for the PCBM-based perovskite solar cells demonstrates a low-temperature processing route with favourable benefits as well as increased control of the perovskite films ’ morphologies  Different strategies have been used to control the crystallisation and to improve the morphologies of perovskite thin films in the PCBM-based perovskite solar cells  Shen et al  have employed the two-step annealing process to fabricate CH3NH3PbI3 ( assisted by doping with PbCl2 ) perovskites thin films [ 29 ]  They found that thermal annealing has improved the surface coverage as well as the crystallisation of the perovskite films  PCE of 91 % was achieved for solar cells based on this fabrication approach [ 29 ]  Haung et al  claimed that the application of solvent annealing in the fabrication of perovskite films is an efficient technique to enhance the crystallinity of the perovskites  achieving 1 µm grain size of perovskites  The DMF was thought to promote grain growth due to the high solubility of both PbI2 and MAI in DMF where the latter provide wet environment for the precursor ions and molecules to diffuse longer distance than in the case of all-solid annealing  Solar cells produced using such perovskite films have achieved PCE of 156 % [ 30 ]  Chen and co-worker have used layer-by-layer technique to control the morphology of the perovskite film [ 31 ]  PbCl2 thin film was deposited by thermal evaporation  followed by dipping the film into a solution of CH3NH3I/IPA for several times to form a uniform perovskite layer [ 31 ]  Both solvent annealing and thermal annealing were shown to play a key role in controlling the crystal growth of the perovskites towards improvement of its morphology in the two-step method  However  various other factors can significantly affect the solvent annealing process  such as type and vapour pressure of solvents  process surrounding  and thermal annealing conditions ( annealing temperature  duration and ramping level ) [ 26 ]  Furthermore  reaction time between the pre-coated metal halide and MAI layer after being dipped into the solution of MAI requires an accurate control [ 23 ]  In this paper  we present a simple route to control the morphology of our perovskite films by the two-step deposition method used for the fabrication of PCBM-based PHJ solar cells  Through wide investigation of alternating the MAI concentration and its reaction time with the pre-deposited PbI2 film  high-performance perovskite films were reproducibly obtained  resulting in perovskite solar cell structure with PCE of 15 %  This technique has led to controlling the growth of perovskite crystals resulting in more compact film structure without pin holes and therefore leading to enhanced PCE of the perovskite film-based solar cell  Morphology and crystallinity of our perovskite films were extensively studied using SEM and XRD measurements  2 Experimental 21 Preparation of materials MAI was synthesised in ambient atmosphere at room temperature via the chemical reaction of 27 ml methylamine solution ( CH3NH2  40 wt % in methanol  TCI ) with 30 ml of hydriodic acid ( HI 57 wt % in water  Aldrich ) in a round-bottomed flask kept at 0 °C in an ice bath for 2 h The methylamine solution was added first into the round-bottomed flask and then HI was added drop-wise during stirring  White precipitate of MAI was collected after the mixture in the solution was transformed into a rotary evaporator and heated at 50 °C for 1 h The white precipitate was washed three times with diethyl ether and finally dried in vacuum for 24 h PbI2 solution was prepared by dissolving 1 mol PbI2 in 1 ml DMF solvent and stirred at 70 °C  20 µl of DIO was then added into the solution to promote the dissolution of PbI2  The PbI2 solution became clear after continuous overnight stirring at 70 °C  Thereafter  05  08  10  12 wt % MAI solution were separately produced by adding different amounts of MAI in 2-propanol and stirred for 1 h at 70 °C  The PCBM solution was prepared by dissolving 30 mg of PCBM in 1 ml of chlorobenzene  2 mg of bathocuproine ( BCP ) plus 20 µl acetic acid was dissolved in 1 ml of methanol to form the BCP solution  22 Fabrication of solar cells In the current study perovskite solar cells architecture comprises thin films of ITO/PEDOT : PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/BCP/Au  respectively ; a flow chart illustrating the fabrication process is shown in Fig  1  ITO-coated glass substrates ( ITO thickness is 100 nm ) with sizes of ~ 20 × 25 mm were cleaned with soap and water followed by washing in deionised ( DI ) water  The substrates were blown dry in N2 gas before they were separately cleaned ultrasonically in acetone and 2-propanol and finally blown dry again by N2  The cleaned ITO substrates were spin-coated by PEDOT : PSS solution at spin speed of 3000 rpm followed by heating at 140 °C for 10 min  Thin films of PbI2 were deposited on top of the PEDOT : PSS film by spin-coating at 5000 rpm using the high-purity supersaturated hot solution and then annealed at 70 °C for 8 min on a hot plate  MAI solution with different concentrations was added by drop casting on top of the PbI2 thin film and left to react chemically with PbI2 for various periods of time  The reactants were finally spin-casted at a rotation speed of 4000 rpm  and the obtained films were heated treated at 100 °C for 2 h PCBM films were deposited by spin-coating method at 2000 rpm from PCBM solution on top of the formed perovskite thin film  followed by heat treatment at 100 °C for 30 min  Electron transport layers of BCP of about 10 nm in thickness were spin-coated on top of the BCPM films followed by the deposition of Au films of about 100 nm as the top electrode using vacuum sputtering method  Fig  1 figure 1 Fabrication process of perovskite solar cells ( CH3NH3PbI3 ) using two-step static spin coating technique Full size image 23 Characterisation of solar cells Current density as a function of applied voltage ( J–V ) of the PV devices fabricated in Sect  22 were measured under simulated AM 15G irradiation ( 100 mW/cm2 ) using keithley 2401 source meter ; the measurements were carried out under ambient environment  A Schott KG5 colour-filtered Si diode ( Hamamatsu S1133 ) was utilised to calibrate the light intensity of the solar light simulator before J–V measurement were carried out  An aperture of aluminium mask was applied on the PV devices to obtain an active area of 004 cm2 and to prevent any contribution from externally fallen light on the devices  X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) measurements of the perovskite layers were performed using Philips X ’ PERT MPD with operational parameters of 40 kV and 40 mA  Optical properties of the films were analysed using Varian 50 Scan UV–Vis Spectrophotometer  Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) was used to investigate morphology of the perovskite films using FEI-nova nanosem 200 SEM  3 Results and discussion MAI concentration effects on the perovskite crystal growth Different concentrations of MAI in the range 05–12 wt % were separately utilised to apply onto the pre-coated PbI2 thin films and allowing different reaction times ( 20 and 60 s )  followed by thermal annealing of the obtained perovskite films at 100 °C for 2 h A processing model to describe the formation of the perovskite thin film with different concentrations of the MAI solutions ( 05  08  10 and 12 wt % ) is schematically presented in Fig  2  When the MAI solution reached to the pre-coated PbI2 crystals  nucleation of an intermediate phase of perovskites only happened at those areas where the MAI concentration must be greater than a threshold concentration ( Ck ) ; lower concentrations of MAI than Ck is not expected to result in such crystal growth  A specific reaction time between MAI and PbI2 allows the growth of an intermediate phase of perovskite  This intermediate phase is then transformed into full perovskite phase after the film is thermally annealed at 100 °C  When the lower concentration of 05 or 08 wt % of MAI solution were applied onto the pre-formed PbI2 film ( as shown in Fig  2 ) only a small perturbation in the MAI concentration has led to some areas with locally high concentration of MAI  which resulted in the formation of a sporadically distributed intermediate phase of CH3NH3PbI3  Only when the concentration of MAI increased to 10 wt %  the distributed amount of MAI on the whole surface area of the PbI2 film was maintained at a concentration above Ck  and thus a gradually controlled crystal growth happened  Thin films with a uniform intermediate perovskite phase were formed after the reaction was maintained for about one minute  Longer growth ( reaction ) time and higher concentration of MAI will lead to the lift-off of the intermediate perovskite phase from the substrate  which will then lead to reduction in the thickness of the final perovskite film by the following spin-coating process  Fig  2 figure 2 A schematic diagram of the processing model for the formation of perovskite thin films by different MAI concentrations Full size image Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) was used to study the morphology of the perovskite films and the results are shown in Fig  3  When the lowest concentration of 05 wt % MAI was added onto the pre-coated PbI2 film  the size of the perovskite crystals increased from ~ 07 µm for the 20 s reaction time to ~ 10 µm for the 60 s reaction time  as seen in Fig  3a  b  When comparing Fig  3a with Fig  3b  the slightly dissolved PbI2 film was observed except the sporadically distributed perovskite crystals  which did not cover the whole surface  In other words  most of the PbI2 crystals were only slightly dissolved by the MAI solution  The low MAI concentration has led to low nucleation density and thus low crystallisation of the perovskites  Further increase in the reaction time between MAI and PbI2 did not make any contribution to the enhancement of the nucleation density on the surface of the PbI2 film  Interestingly  with the increase of the MAI concentration to 08 wt %  we noticed that crystallisation occurred with an increased surface coverage on the PbI2 thin film as indicated in Fig  3c  d However  the size of the perovskite crystals decreased to ~ 04 µm regardless of how long the reaction time was  With a further increase of the MAI concentration to 10 wt %  the coverage of the perovskite surface reached full coverage of the original PbI2 surface  meaning that all PbI2 crystals have reacted with MAI to form perovskites as shown in Fig  3e  f Again  we observed that the size of perovskites continued to decrease to about 02 µm  Fig  3 figure 3 SEM images of the perovskite films with different MAI concentrations and 20 or 60 s reaction time  respectively : a 05 wt %  20 s ; b 05 wt %  60 s ; c 08 wt %  20 s ; d 08 wt %  60 s ; e 10 wt %  20 s ; f 10 wt % 60 s ; g 12 wt % 20 s ; h 12 wt % 60 s Full size image Nevertheless  when the concentration of the MAI solution further increased to 12 wt %  pore defects among the smaller nano-sized perovskite crystals were revealed in Fig  3g  h As shown in Fig  3  the size of the perovskite crystals in the film did not change with extending reaction time from 20 s to 60 s when using high concentrations of 08  1 and 12 wt % of MAI solutions  These results confirm that the size of crystals in the perovskite film was determined in the initial reaction stage when the MAI solution came into contact with the pre-coated PbI2  SEM was also used to further study the morphology of the cross section of the perovskite films and the results are shown in Fig  4  Figure 4a shows a cross section SEM image of the perovskite film fabricated by the 08 wt % MAI solution  where the corresponding thickness of the perovskite film was ~ 400 nm  The image shows that the nano-sized polycrystals of CH3NH3PbI3 did not connect together as was also shown in Fig  3c  d  where considerable residual PbI2 phases have existed in the film  As demonstrated in Fig  3e  f  interconnected CH3NH3PbI3 crystals without any residual PbI2 phases were only formed after applying 10 wt % MAI solution onto the pre-coated PbI2 film  The thickness of the perovskite film was ~ 200 nm as demonstrated in Fig  4b  A further increase in the MAI solution concentration to 12 wt % has led to the formation of pore defects among the smaller nano-sized perovskite crystals as revealed in Fig  3g  h The thickness of the perovskite film has exhibited a significant decrease to ~ 120 nm as demonstrated by the cross section image in Fig  4c  Fig  4 figure 4 SEM cross section images of the perovskite films with different MAI concentrations : a 08 wt % ; b 10 wt % ; c 12 wt % Full size image Effect of MAI concentration on light absorption and crystal structure of perovskite films Light absorption by the formed perovskite films was examined to study the impact of the MAI concentrations on the optical properties of the perovskite films  All perovskite films with different MAI concentrations show absorption onset at ~ 780 nm as shown in Fig  5  which could conform to a band gap value of ~ 152 eV for the perovskites  The perovskite film produced by the low concentration of 08 wt % MAI exhibited the highest thickness as shown in Fig  4a  and thus the highest light absorption  On the other hand  the perovskite film obtained by the highest MAI concentration of 12 wt % resulted in the lowest thickness which is associated with a significant decrease in the absorption intensity as demonstrated in Fig  5  The perovskite thin film produced from the 10 wt % MAI solution showed an excellent light absorption between the perovskite films obtained by 08 wt % and 12 wt % MAI solutions  Fig  5 figure 5 UV–Vis absorption spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 films with different MAI concentrations and 60 s reaction time Full size image X-ray diffraction measurements ( XRD ) were used to characterise the crystalline structure of the perovskites films produced with different MAI concentrations and the results are presented in Fig  6  All perovskite films were prepared under the same condition on glass slides with exactly the same size  Diffraction peaks that belong to CH3NH3PbI3 polycrystals are indicated by “ ν ” while the main peaks assigned to the residual PbI2 phase are illustrated by “ ● ”  The XRD pattern of the film produced from the lowest MAI concentration ( 05 wt % ) reveals different peak positions at 2Ɵ of 82°  128°  142°  2009°  238°  284°  319°  407°  426° and 52°  Most peaks belong to the perovskite structure except the peaks at 82° and 128° are due to the residual PbI2 phase  According to Qiu and co-workers  the measured peaks at 2Ɵ of 142°  2009°  238°  284°  319°  407° and 426° may correspond to the ( 110 )  ( 112 )  ( 211 )  ( 220 )  ( 310 )  ( 224 ) and ( 314 ) crystal faces of the tetragonal perovskite [ 32 ]  The high intensity of the two peaks at 2Ɵ of 82° and 128° indicates the considerable presence of residual PbI2 phases in the sample  Increasing the MAI concentration to 08 wt % led to more perovskite phases in the film as shown in Fig  6  where the two peaks assigned to the residual PbI2 phase have reduced significantly  When the MAI concentration reached 10 wt %  only peaks assigned to the perovskite phase can be observed in the XRD pattern  suggesting that PbI2 phase has completely changed to perovskites via reaction  For the films produced with a higher concentration of MAI of 12 wt %  the main diffraction peak at 2Ɵ of 142° for the perovskite phase has decreased in intensity due to the reduction in film thickness  Fig  6 figure 6 X-ray diffraction patterns of CH3NH3PbI3 films with different MAI concentrations and 60 s reaction time Full size image Solar cells performance of perovskites from different MAI concentrations It has been shown earlier that the concentration of the MAI solution and reaction time between MAI and PbI2 are crucial to obtain high-quality perovskite thin films for solar cell applications  It can therefore be expected that such high quality films would play a key role in achieving reproducible solar cell characteristics and thus high PCE  Main perovskite phase was achieved when 1 min reaction time was utilized between MAI and PbI2  Therefore  different concentrations of MAI solution were taken to fabricate perovskite thin films with 1 min reaction time with PbI2 in order to study the properties of the thus produced solar cells  The quality of the perovskite thin films has played a key role in determining the PCE of solar cells  The concentration of the MAI solution and reaction time between MAI and PbI2 are crucial to obtain high-quality perovskite thin films  We have found that reproducible solar cell characteristics were achieved when 1 min reaction time was utilised  Therefore  different concentrations of the MAI solution and 1 min reaction time were taken to fabricate perovskite thin films for our solar cells to compare with their PCEs  Figure 7 shows J–V characteristics of solar cells produced with different MAI concentrations  Among all measured characteristics  the best performance was achieved with solar cells produced using perovskite film made with 10 wt % MAI solution deposited onto the pre-coated PbI2 thin film  A summary of performance of all PV devices is listed in Table 1  It is shown that solar cells made with 10 wt % MAI concentration have demonstrated typical performance with PCE of 1501 %  short circuit current of 238 mA/cm2  and fill factor of 070  Such high performance solar cells were achieved as a result of uniform  homogeneous  and connected perovskite thin films  Solar cells produced with 12 wt % MAI solution exhibited a reduction in their performance  A low PCE of 676 % can be ascribed to the low current density of 147 mA/cm2 and low FF of 05 measured for such devices  The smaller thickness of the perovskite film obtained from using such MAI concentration may be considered as the main reason for the low device performance  Furthermore  solar cells produced with perovskite film from the 08 wt % MAI solution have demonstrated the poorest PCE of 419 %  which is the consequence of low current density of 114 mA/cm2 and very poor FF of 038  The high proportion of the residual PbI2 phase in the perovskite thin film may be considered as the main culprit for the poor performance  The other reason for such poor performance may be ascribed to the poor surface coverage of the perovskite film leading to formation of pin holes and thus short circuit current  All studied perovskite solar cells produced with different MAI concentrations have demonstrated high open-circuit voltage above 09 V Fig  7 figure 7 J–V performances of the perovskite solar cells with different MAI concentrations

Full size image The influence of hysteresis on our perovskite solar cells is also investigated in the current work  Figure 10 shows J–V measurements of perovskit solar cells made with 10 wt % MAI solution scanned in forward and reverse bias directions  where the phenomenon of hysteresis is considered as one of main concerns in the stability of perovskite-based solar cells [ 33 ]  Our solar cells exhibited convergent performance in PCE under both forward and reverse scan directions  suggesting almost negligible hysteresis effect  This is credited to the reduction in the density of defects due to the controlled morphologies of our perovskite films by the two-step fabrication method [ 33 ]  The decent interface between the perovskite layer and the electron or hole transport layers can be another reason for the mitigation of the hysteresis effect in the perovskite solar cells [ 34 ]  Fig  10 figure 10 J–V curves under forward and reverse scan for the typical perovskite solar cells Full size image 4 Conclusion The low-temperature two-step fabrication method was used to produce the high quality CH3NH3PbI3 thin films for PHJ solar cells  It was found that concentration of the MAI solution and reaction time between MAI and PbI2 have a significant impact on the morphologies and crystal growth of the perovskite thin films  Highly reproducible perovskite thin films were fabricated for solar cells application when 10 wt % MAI solution was applied to preformed PbI2 films  Among 110 solar cells from the best perovskite films made with the 10 wt % MAI solution and one minute reaction time about one-third have exhibited an average performance with PCE of 1363 % while the highest achieved PCE was of 1501 % Retraction Note : Graded bandgap perovskite solar

the attempt for the stability study of large-area PSCs ( active area of 100 cm2 ) in near space  The devices were fixed on the high-altitude balloon risen from ground to near space at an altitude of

solar cells Article 31 October 2016 Introduction Metal halide perovskites with the formula of ABX3 ( where A is an organic or cesium cation  B is a lead or tin cation and X is a halide anion ) have achieved an undeniable breakthrough on photovoltaic development  The power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of perovskite solar cells has rapidly rocketed from 39 % to certified 227 % during the past few years12345 ( https : //wwwnrelgov/pv/assets/images/efficiency-chartpng )  The impressive PCE increase can be attributed to their superior optoelectronic properties  including strong absorption coefficient ( ~105 cm−1 )  low exciton binding energy ( ~20 meV )  and relatively long carrier diffusion length ( > 1 μm ) 67 In addition  a wide range of solution processing techniques  including one-step deposition8 two-steps sequential deposition4 solvent-quenching9 and other modified approaches based on these methods have been developed to fabricate uniform and high-crystalline perovskite films  resulting in the fast rising in the device performance  Furthermore  composition engineering of perovskite materials from the basic methylammonium lead triiodide ( MAPbI3  CH3NH3PbI3 ) perovskite to current mixed-cation and mixed-anion halide perovskites lead to high-efficiency and improved stability5101112 Despite the rapid progress  the device performance of perovskite solar cells is still far from their theoretical limits  A key factor to further improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells is to develop high-quality perovskite active layers with further reduced defect density and less nonradiative recombination processes  Recently  a certified efficiency of 221 % has been achieved by introducing additional triiodide ions during the formation of perovskite films to suppress the formation of deep-level defects5 Along with the rapid progress of perovskite solar cells  some review articles have been published covering various critical aspects with particular focuses on the film deposition and device engineering13141516 photophysical properties1718192021 interfacial materials21222324 long-term stability25262728 and toxicity293031 However  to the best of our knowledge  few reviews systematically discussed the achievements in addressing the defects in perovskites  including defects at the surface or in the bulk films  In this review  we briefly introduce the effects of defects in polycrystalline perovskite films on the device performance of perovskite solar cells  We summarize the achievements that have been made in the field of defects engineering investigations  We focus on the methodologies on reducing the defect states of metal halide perovskites  including efforts on crystal growth  post treatments  and interfacial modifications  We anticipate that this review will spur new strategies for defects control of perovskites  leading to perovskite solar cells with further improved efficiency and long-term stability beyond the state-of-the-art  Effects of defects in perovskite films and the device performance of solar cells Although the metal halide perovskites have shown high defect-tolerance  it is now generally accepted that there are still deep defects in perovskite thin films that hinder the PCE of perovskite solar cells approaching the Schockley-Queisser limit3233 In this section  we will simply talk about the defect properties in perovskite films and their influence on device performance  It is known that defects in the light-harvesting layer influence the device performance metrics of the ensuing solar cells  To get a deep understanding of defects in metal halide perovskites  we refer the reader to a very informative review given by Ball and co-workers focusing on the origin and nature of defects in halide perovskite semiconductors and their impacts on the active layer and the obtained solar cells20 According to previous calculation and experimental results  the nature and density of defect states in perovskites is highly sensitive to the film deposition conditions34 For example  Nazeeruddin and co-workers reported that defects of IPb ( I atom occupying a Pb site ) lies at ca  −060 eV below the conduction band minimum ( CB ) is dominant in the perovskites processed from the one-step spin-coating method  while IMA located at ca  −075 eV below the CB is the main deep defect of perovskite films fabricated from the sequential deposition method34 Sargent and co-workers calculated the defect formation energies of MAPbI3 perovskites under different conditions35 They predicted that perovskites grown under iodine-rich conditions are prone to a high density of deep electronic traps  while low trap densities below 1015 cm−3 in perovskites can be achieved  Although many intrinsic defects form shallow states  which is one of the major reasons for the defect tolerance of metal halide perovskites  the less-likely though existent deep charge-carrier trap states and the resulting non-radiative losses in the perovskite films still limit the device efficiency of perovskite solar cells approaching the Shockley-Queisser limit3233 Considering the lack of stoichiometric compositions at the surfaces of grains and the sublimation of organic molecules during the thermal annealing process could leave defects  it is believed that most of the defects in perovskite films are mainly located at the grain boundaries or the surface3637 Moreover  due to the presence of dangling bonds on the crystal surface  a series of dimensional defects would be formed on the grain boundaries and surface by the combination of point defects and defect arrays37 Grain boundaries as sources for high defect densities were confirmed by the fact that the trap density in solution-processed polycrystalline MAPbI3 perovskite films ( 1016–1017 cm−3 ) is much higher than that in perovskite single crystals ( 109–1010 cm−3 ) 3839 These defects have also been visualized by Stranks and co-workers using microscale PL measurements39 They found lower PL intensities at the grain boundaries than grain interiors  implying more defects and a faster non-radiative decay at the grain boundaries ( Fig  1c )  After pyridine passivation  the PL intensity of the entire film was improved by a factor of ~8 × integrated over the entire image ( Figs  1d  e )  However  the role of grain boundaries on the overall device performance is still under debate and  eg  unmodified recombination properties were observed for devices with perovskite layers with different grain size40 Although grain boundaries display lower luminescence intensities than their interiors/surfaces  the luminescence lifetimes at grain boundaries may be similar as that at the interiors/surfaces41 Furthermore  the unbalanced accumulation or depletion between grain boundaries by charged ionic defects in perovskites may cause band downward or upward bending  which may help or impede the separation of electronic charge carriers19 For example  a small potential barrier for electron transport ( upward bending ) was formed at the grain boundary of MAPbI3 on titanium oxide ( TiO2 ) substrates due to the accumulation of positively charged defects39 While a potential barrier for hole transport ( downward bending ) has been observed at the grain boundaries of MAPbI3 on poly ( 34-ethylenedioxythiophene ) polystyrene sulfonate ( PEDOT : PSS ) substrates42 Therefore  the optoelectronic properties of grain boundary are sensitive to defect types  which depends on materials composition  substrate properties  and preparation methods19 Besides  there is another possible source of defects : impurities  They might just cause point defects and hardly influence the morphology of the film  but they could form recombination centers4344 For example  Grätzel and co-workers observed that considerable amounts of Au from the electrode diffuse across the hole-transporting layer ( HTL ) of 22′77′‐tetrakis‐ ( N  N‐di‐4‐methoxyphenylamino ) ‐99′‐spirobifluorene ( Spiro-MeOTAD ) into the perovskite layer at temperatures exceeding 70 °C  which causes the irreversible loss of open-circuit voltage ( Voc )  fill factor ( FF )  and photocurrent ( Jsc ) in the aged devices  Insertion of a thin Cr interlayer between the HTL and the Au alleviates the problem of Au migration and device degradation43 Fig  1 figure 1 Defect properties of perovskite films  a Calculated transition energy levels of point defects in CH3NH3PbI3  The formation energies of neutral defects are shown in

TRPL ) decay curves on the control and target perovskite layers emitted at λ = 825 nm with the biexponential fitting5 Full size image Defects that cause electronic states in the band gap of the semiconductor  act as Shockley-Read-Hall ( SRH ) nonradiative recombination centers  Therefore  they cause a decrease of charge carrier lifetimes and photovoltaic performance  especially the Voc45 Basically  reducing the rate of trap-assisted recombination would allow devices to reach higher voltages before the photocurrent is canceled completely by recombination46 The Voc can be formulated in terms of non-radiative voltage loss form the maximum achievable voltage 47 where EQEEL is the external quantum efficiency of electroluminescence  k is Boltzmann constant  T is temperature  and e the elementary charge  Naturally  reducing the defect density and the non-radiative recombination in solar cells is the main strategy to reduce  A EQEEL of 05 % and of ~013 V were achieved by Grätzel and co-workers through adding excess PbI2 to suppresses non-radiative charge recombination in the perovskite films48 By introducing additional triiodide ions  the deep defects associated with interstitial Pb ( Pbi ) and antisite defects ( MAI  PbI  IMA  and IPb ) can be reduced ( Figs  1d  e ) 5 Following this approach  a certified efficiency of 221 % for small-area and 197 % for 1 cm2 solar cells were achieved  Defects in perovskite films and on their surfaces are considered as one of the main reasons for the anomalous current density–voltage ( J–V ) hysteresis behavior of perovskite solar cells74950 The presence of defects may provide a favorable pathway for the migration of ions ( possibly iodide ions ) due to reduced steric hindrance51 Considering the defects induced charge traps can be filled under forward bias condition and further be discharged under short-circuit condition  the trapping and the de-trapping process of these electron traps may contribute to J–V hysteresis behavior  A direct evidence demonstrated by Huang and co-workers is that the deposited fullerenes on top of the perovskite films can efficiently reduce the trap density by two orders of magnitude and eliminate the photocurrent hysteresis51 Park and co-workers  reported that the hysteresis probably results from the formation of iodide Frenkel defects with the migration of iodide ions into the Oh interstitial sites  which could be prevented by KI doping52 Defects at grain boundaries and interfaces are suspected to be responsible for triggering the degradation of perovskite films  It is now apparent that grain boundaries are the most vulnerable sites for degradation  because they provide charge accumulation sites as well as infiltration pathway of water vapor  A possible scenario how trapped charge promote the irreversible decomposition of perovskite materials has been investigated by Choi and co-workers53 They found that the perovskite materials degraded along grain boundaries only when both moisture and trapped charges exist simultaneously by two steps  First  in the presence of water molecules  perovskite materials are known to form hydrates54 Next  the charges trapped at the defect site could help to deprotonate organic cations by the induced local electric field  Such a de-protonation process could yield volatile molecules such as CH3CH2 ( MA ) and HC ( =NH ) NH2 ( FA ) and degrade the perovskite films  One the other hand  the defects-related ion migration could corrode the conductive metal electrodes and cause performance degradation of perovskite solar cells55 The calculated activation barriers for iodine ions migrations in perovskite films is only around 01–03 eV5657 It has been proved that iodine concentration close to the Ag electrode increases in time during the aging process55 Consequently  the migration of iodine ions will contaminate the Ag electrodes and form a thin insulating layer that causes performance degradation of perovskite solar cells58 By integrating a new amine-mediated titanium suboxide as an efficient chemical inhibition layer  the metal electrodes can be protected by the ionic defects migration from the perovskite layer59 Effective methods to control the defects in perovskite films We focus on defects engineering on enlarging the grain size  grain boundary and surface passivation  as well as interfacial modification for high-quality perovskite films  We briefly summarize the developed film deposition approaches and composition engineering of the precursors for high-quality perovskite films with large grain size and reduced defects  In addition  post-treatments of the perovskite films including surface passivation with Lewis bases and acids  and photo-curing on reducing the defects of perovskite films are discussed  Moreover  we summarize the effects of substrate modification on the defects properties of perovskite films and the obtained solar cells  Increasing the grain size of perovskite films Although the effects of grain boundaries in perovskite films on the device performance are still not completely clear  perovskite films with large grains have been demonstrated to exhibit lower trap state density and reduced recombination centers  which are beneficial for the improved device performance of perovskite solar cells60 In addition  it has been revealed that ion migration  which dominated the hysteresis behavior and long-term device stability  is much faster at the grain boundaries than that in the grains of perovskite film61 These previous results suggest that the grain boundaries in the perovskite active layer need to be efficiently controlled to achieve perovskite solar cells with high-efficiency and long-term stability  During the past few years  various kinds of deposition methods have been developed to fabricate high-quality perovskite films with large grains  In this section  we mainly discuss the effects of annealing environment  film deposition methods and the surface property of substrates on the grain size of perovskite films  The grain size of polycrystalline perovskite films is highly related to the crystallization rate during the film formation process  Many studies imply that a slow crystallization process probably reduces the nucleation numbers and increases the grain size6062 An effective method to decrease the crystallization rate is the solvent annealing method  where the thermal annealing of perovskite films is processed under N  N-dimethylformamide ( DMF ) or dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) vapor963 Since both PbI2 and MAI exhibit high solubility in DMF/DMSO  the ions and molecules in the precursor could diffuse a longer distance in wet DMF/DMSO vapor environment  leading to slower crystallization and enlarged grain sizes up to ~1 μm9 As a consequence  the charge-recombination lifetime of the solvent-annealed device increased to 72 μs  much longer than that of 17 μs in the thermally annealed device  representing reduced defects in the obtained perovskite films  Following the same strategy  pyridine  which was demonstrated to efficiently passivate the defects within the perovskite films  was used to proceed the solvent annealing process  resulting in MAPbI3 films with a grain size up to 5 μm6465 In addition  the defect density in the obtained films was reduced to half of that in the conventionally thermally annealed ones  Moisture during the annealing process plays a critical role on enlarging the grain size and reducing the defects in perovskite films  Although exposure under high humidity would cause fast degradation of perovskite films66 some studies found that a small amount of H2O in the precursor would increase the solubility of PbI2 and the treatment of perovskite films under a certain humidity could reduce the defects density67686970 A typical example was investigated by Yang and co-workers who deposited the perovskite films by the one-step spin-coating method and carried out the thermal annealing under controlled humidity ( 30 ± 5 % relative humidity ) in air  They observed reduced non-radiative recombination for films under humidity conditions than those under dry air conditions6871 The photoluminescence ( PL ) and PL lifetime of perovskite films could also be enhanced by post-treatment of the films in moisture ( 35 % ± 5 % relative humidity ) for 4 h Further retreating the film in N2 atmosphere to remove the possibly adsorbed H2O would not affect the PL properties of the perovskite film  It was proposed that a small amount of water can solubilize the MA  effectively “ healing ” the perovskite structure by removing the trap states69 The solution-based hot-casting technique  which induces a fast crystallization process of the perovskite  has been demonstrated more efficient to fabricate high-quality perovskite film with millimeter-scale crystalline grains  The method involved casting a hot mixture of PbI2 and MACl solution ( ~70 °C ) onto a high-temperature substrate ( up to 180 °C ) with a perovskite film ( Fig  2a )  The grain size was significantly increased from approximately 20 to 180 μm with increasing the substrate temperature from 100 to 190 °C  The processed perovskite films with large grains exhibit significantly reduced bulk defects and improved charge carrier mobility  leading to much-improved device efficiency to 18 %  In addition to the hot-casting technique  the grain size of perovskite films via a two-step spin-coating procedure can be controlled by varying the concentration of MAI72 For example  the cuboid size of MAPbI3 could be increased from 90 to 720 nm with the concentration of MAI decreasing from 0057 to 0038 M Correspondingly  the average PCE of devices was increased from 135 to 164 %  Fig  2 figure 2 Increasing the grain size of perovskite films  a Hot-casting scheme for large-area crystal growth136 b Schematic the preparation of perovskites by the formation of PbI2-Lewis base adduct ( left ) and some typical Lewis bases for the adducts ( right ) 60 Full size image Another widely adopted methodology to control the growth of perovskite films is the formation of Lewis acid-base adduct approach  where a Lewis base is introduced as electron-pair donor to coordinate with the lead precursor73 A typical example is the formation of FAPbI3 via PbI2-dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ) -FAI phase by following an intramolecular exchange process ( Fig  2b ) :  The formed PbI2-DMSO adduct can retard the rapid reaction between FAI and PbI260 The grain size of the obtained perovskite film was almost doubled compared with that processed from conventional methods and the average PCE was increased from about 147 to 195 % 60 Besides  kinds of interesting Lewis acid-base adducts  including HPbI362 PbI2-thiourea  and PbI2-DMSO1-x-thioureax ( Fig  2c ) 73 have also been developed as precursors for the formation of perovskite films with large grain size and low defect density  Since S-donors were stronger than O-donor to coordinate with Pb  introducing of thiourea can further retard the formation of perovskite74 Therefore  the domain size of formed FAPbI3 films was significantly increased with the increasing component of thiourea in PbI2-DMSO1-x-thioureax system  As a result  the average Voc of FAPbI3 devices was enhanced due to reduced non-radiative recombination  and the J–V hysteresis was decreased73 In addition to coordinate with PbI2  precursors composed of non-PbI2 precursor  such as lead chloride ( PbCl2 ) 3637 Lead thiocyanate ( Pb ( SCN ) 2 ) 75 have also been developed to increase the grain size of perovskite films by the formation of Lewis acid-base intermediate  These intermediates could slow down the perovskite formation process and thus improve the growth of the crystal domains during annealing3637 The MAPbI3 films deposited from PbCl2 with MAx+yPbI2+xCly intermediate exhibit a 10 fold greater diffusion length than that of MAPbI3 processed from PbI27677 It is noted that the long diffusion length in MAPbI3 films from PbCl2 also suggests less defect density at the grain boundary78 The perovskite crystal lateral size can reach up to 5 μm with 3 % Pb ( SCN ) 2 as additives and the carrier lifetime of obtained solar cells was enhanced from 1019 to 1554 ns79 The grain size of perovskite films can also be efficiently controlled through tuning the surface property of the substrate underneath  Huang and co-workers systematically investigated the film growth of perovskite using a two-step thermal annealing-assisted interdiffusion method on a wide range of hole transport layers with different surface properties80 They revealed that the nucleation and grain growth process of perovskite show significant difference on wetting and non-wetting substrates  On the wetting surface of PEDOT : PSS coated substrates  the grain boundaries were likely pinned by the impurities lying in the grain boundaries and the average lateral grain size of the obtained perovskite film was limited to ~300 nm  They proposed that the grain boundary mobility was significantly reduced by the surface tension dragging force from the wetting substrates  leading to small grains close to the PEDOT : PSS side and titled grain boundaries between the large grains  Through replacing the PEDOT : PSS with hydrophobic hole transport layers such as N4  N4′-bis ( 4- ( 6- ( ( 3-ethyloxetan-3-yl ) methoxy ) hexyl ) phenyl ) -N4  N4′-diphenylbiphenyl-44′-diamine ( c-OTPD )  the dragging force was diminished  resulting in supressed heterogeneous nucleation of perovskite and thus larger grain size  The decreased grain boundaries and the improved crystallinity dramatically reduced bulk and surface defects as well as charge recombination in the perovskite films  leading to much improved device performance of perovskite solar cells  Composition and solution chemistry engineering for high-quality perovskite films Composition engineering of the perovskite has been proven critical to achieve perovskite solar cells with improved device efficiency and long-term stability  Recently  perovskites composed of mixed cations ( MA  FA  and Cs ) and mixed anions ( I and Br ) have driven a paradigm shift in perovskite solar cells  In fact  except for the first certified efficiency record for perovskite cells using pure MAPbI3  the following subsequent National Renewable Energy Laboratory records with publicly disclosed information used A and/or X site mixed hybrid perovskites ( eg  MAPbI1-xBrx  FA085MA015PbI255Br045  Cs01FA075MA015PbI249Br051 )  In addition  the solution chemistry engineering of the precursor is also important to reduce the defects density of perovskite films and consequently results in improved performance of perovskite solar cells  In this section  we will highlight the benefits of composition and solution chemistry engineering on reducing the defects in perovskite films and improving the device performance of perovskite solar cells  Composition engineering Mixed cations or/and anions based perovskites exhibit unexpected properties  such as inhibited formation of yellow FAPbI3  suppressed the phase segregation of I−Br-based perovskite  improved long-term stability toward light and moisture  as well as enhanced PCE of devices1281 For example  it has been demonstrated that a small amount of MA can induce the formation of the structurally stable black phase of FA perovskite  leading to the PCE of perovskite solar cells based on ( FAPbI3 ) 1−x ( MAPbBr3 ) x beyond 20 % 4882 With further addition of inorganic cesium ( Cs )  the resulted triple cation perovskites show much improved reproducibility and enhanced device performance with a high stabilized power output of 211 % 83 Cs/FA mixtures could suppress the halide segregation of I-Br based perovskite  enabling the formation of perovskite films with stable and optimized bandgaps for perovskite/silicon tandem devices81 The high efficiency of mixed perovskites is related with improved defect tolerance properties and lower defect densities  It has been estimated that the incorporation of Cs can reduce the trap density of FA083MA017Pb ( I083Br017 ) 3 from 25 × 1015 to 80 × 1014 cm−3 ( Figs  3b  c ) 84 Similarly  the addition of Br− has also been demonstrated to increase the defects tolerance property of perovskites  Based on first-principles calculations  Angelis and co-workers found that bromide ions can substitute the interstitial iodides and shift the defect energy levels by ~03 eV towards the valence band  leading to transforming mixed-halide interstitial deep traps into shallow ones  which are less detrimental according to the SRH recombination model85 A substantially longer PL decay was observed for the Br-doped samples  which is consistent with the proposed curing of deep defects in Table 1  Fig  3 figure 3 PbI2 or KI passivated perovskite devices  a–d artistic illustration of different grain boundary character as a function

image Table 1 Summary of enlarging perovskite grain size and the related highest PCE of devices Full size table A non-stoichiometric solution of PbI2 and organic iodide has been successfully employed to modify film formation  Tress and co-workers have demonstrated that excess PbI2 can efficiently suppress the nonradiative charge recombination in the perovskite films  leading to of FA085MA015Pb ( I085Br015 ) 3 films at ~013 V48 The detailed role of excess PbI2 depends on the fabrication methods and the location of PbI2 in perovskite films ( Figs  3a–d ) 86 Excess PbI2 introduced by the two-step spin-coating method can reduce the defects density at the interface  By controlling the dipping time of PbI2 films in MAI solution  the residual PbI2 could modify the perovskite/TiO2 interface87 It was also found that the trap density of TiO2 could be decreased from 1016∕cm3 to 1012  and 1011∕cm388 Moreover  the presence of PbI2 at the interface could inhibit the back electron transfer from TiO2 to the valence band of the perovskite ( causing charge recombination ) 87 According to the characterization results from transmission electron microscopy  Hagfeldt and co-workers found that excess PbI2 is mainly included in the grains for one-step solution processing  which can increase grain sizes and improve crystallinity of perovskite films86 The PCE of MAPbI3 solar cells can reach up to over 19 % with 10 % excess PbI2  The excess PbI2 can also be introduced by annealing perovskite films  Considering that the decomposition starts by MA leaving the grain boundaries  most of the decomposed PbI2 is believed to be located at the grain boundaries194289 It was revealed that PbI2 at the grain boundaries can have a passivation effect and increase contact selectivity9091 Compared with the PbI2-rich condition  perovskite films processed from PbI2-poor synthesis conditions were also reported to result in a perovskite phase with high-crystal quality and improved PL yields compared to stoichiometric conditions  However  it was proposed that the grain boundaries enriched in organic components obtained from this PbI2-poor condition form a barrier for charge transport and decrease the photocurrent86 In contrast  unlike the perovskite system with mixed cations and anions  Park and co-workers have demonstrated that a thin MAI layer using a Lewis-acid-base adduct approach could act as a grain boundary healing layer of devices based on pure MAPbI3 perovskite  They found that alothough the excess MAI existing on the perovskite grain surfaces hardly changes the crystal structure and lattice constants  carrier recombination due to defects at/near grain boundaries was suppressed and the charge extraction at the interfaces was improved  Consequently  perovksite solar cells with efficiency exceeding 20 % have been achieved based on perovskites processed from precursors with slight excess MAI92 Solution chemistry engineering There have been numerous reports of the introduction of additives to precursor solutions to enable the formation of perovskite films with fewer defects  The mechanism is related to the formation of high-quality perovskite grains or passivation of grain boundary and surface  The additives used in perovskites ( such as polymers  organic halide salts  solvents and nanoparticles ) have been reviewed before93 In this section  we mainly discuss the effects of alkali halides and acids additives on the perovskite films and the resulting solar cells  The addition of alkali halides could efficiently suppress the formation of deep-level defects  such as interstitial and antisite defects  which are responsible for nonradiative recombination centers in perovskite layers94 Saliba et al demonstrated that the incorporation of rubidium iodide ( RbI ) could increase the PL quantum yield of CsMAFA-based perovskite from 24 to 36 % 95 The EQEEL is > 1 % at a driving current that is equal to the short-circuit current and reaches 38 % for higher driving currents  suggesting all major sources of non-radiative recombination were strongly suppressed after introducing of RbI  Correspondingly  the maximum open-circuit voltage can reach up to 124 V with a loss in potential of 039 V It has been revealed that Rb does not incorporate into the 3D perovskite lattice based on solid-state NMR measurement96 Most recently  Park and co-workers found that the alkali ions in additives are also important for preventing the formation of iodide Frenkel defects52 They compared a series of experiments with alkali metal iodides of LiI  NaI  KI  and RbI and revealed that the potassium ion is efficient to achieve hysteresis-free solar cells ( Fig  3e )  The enhanced PCE and decreased hysteresis in J–V curves were attributed to reduced Frenkel defects and suppressed migration of iodide vacancy52 In addition to the reduced non-radiative recombination with excess KI ( Fig  3f )  Stranks and co-workers further demonstrated potassium halide can also inhibit the photoinduced halide segregation and subsequent emission from low-bandgap iodide-rich components  Meanwhile  the external photoluminescence quantum yields can reach up to 66 %  which corresponds to internal quantum yields exceeding 95 % 97 In addition to alkali metal iodides  various kinds of acids  including hydroiodic acid ( HI ) 98 hypophosphorous acids ( HPA ) 99 and HCOOH  have also been sucessfully employed as additives to reduce the defect density of perovskite films100 With the addition of HI101 the perovskite films exhibited improved surface coverage and crystallinity as observed from XRD  It was initially speculated that these acid additives could enhance the solubility of PbI2 in DMF by the temporary coplanar chelation with Pb2+  which can control the crystal growth toward the perfect crystal structure101102 Snaith and co-workers also demonstrated that HPA can prevent the reduction of I− to I2 and the formation of unsaturated Pb on their surface and the I/Pb stoichiometry was increased from 219 to 25099 They further observed that the addition of acids ( HCl  HI  HPA  and HCOOH ) would result in the dissolution of colloids in the perovskite precursor solution100 More recently  they claimed that the introduced acids increased the hydrolysis of DMF with the production of dimethylamine  which plays an important role in the dissolution of colloids and enhancing film quality  Correspondingly  the open-circuit voltages of resulted FA083MA017Pb ( I083Br017 ) 3 devices with the addition of HCOOH can reach up to 121 V with an extremely low Voc loss of 360 mV100 Post-treatment of perovskite films The surface of films represents the largest possible disturbance of the symmetry of the crystal lattice  Considering the easy sublimation of organic molecules during the thermal annealing process  the surface defects of the perovskite films might be more serious  Therefore  post treatments of the perovskite films should be an effective strategy to reduce the surface dangling bonds and enhance device performance  In this part  we will focus on the progress of passivating the surface defects by Lewis acids or bases and photo curing of perovskite films to de-activate the surface defects  Defects passivation by Lewis acid or Lewis base It was believed that two kinds of defects exist on the surface of perovskite films  under-coordinated I and under-coordinated Pb atoms  The under-coordinated atoms would act as recombination centers  leading to an accumulation and/or recombination of charges at the interface of the charge transport layers  In this section  we will mainly focus on the passivation of perovskite by small molecules  The principle for choosing efficient passivation molecules is mainly based on “ Lewis acid-Lewis base coordination ”  The chemical structures of the used small molecules and the related device performance are summarized in Fig  4 and Table 2  Fig  4

stated treatment with pulsed excitation at 405 nm121 Full size image Table 2 Summary of surface/bottom passivation and corresponding photovoltaic performance Full size table To passivate the under-coordinated I  Lewis acid of iodopentafluorobenzene ( IPFB ) was introduced to self-assemble onto the surface of perovskite films103 The electro-negative fluorine atoms in IPFB inductively withdraw electron density out of the aromatic ring  which in turn leaves a partial positive charge on this halogen  and thus can accept electrons from under-coordinated I to form a halogen bond  Later on  another strong electron acceptor of 2356-Tetrafluoro-7788-tetracyanoquinodimethane ( F4TCNQ ) was reported as a Lewis acid to form a supramolecular interaction with under-coordinated I104 The Voc of MAPbI3 devices can reach 106 and 107 V with IPFB and F4TCNQ passivation  respectively  Apart from passivation  electrons will diffuse from perovskite to F4TCNQ with the formation of an interfacial dipole layer at the perovskite/F4TCNQ interface  Therefore  F4TCNQ could also create an energy barrier to electron diffusion and lead to enhanced Jsc in the modified devices  To passivate under-coordinated Pb  the first demonstration is pyridine and thiophene as Lewis base for coordination through N and S atoms  respectively65 The trap density extracted from intensity-dependent PL decays of the as-prepared films was reduced from 35 × 1016 to 10 × 1016 cm−3 and 02 × 1016 cm−3  and the efficiencies of the obtained solar cells were increased from 13 to 153 and 165 % after thiophene and pyridine passivation  respectively  Moreover  the rising time to reach 95 % of the maximum stabilized power output ( sampling time ) was reduced from 40 to 12 s and less than 2 s for the control and the thiophene and pyridine-treated devices  respectively65 The decreased rising time may derive from an increased ability to rapidly fill all the defects sites in the passivated films with lower trap density  Through using pyridine vapor  the average photoluminescence of the CH3NH3PbI3 film increases about 15 times after “ pyridine recrystallization ”  PCE of perovskite solar cells increased from 95 % for as-deposited films to more than 18 % with an Voc of 115 V for the recrystallized films105 Notably  post-treatment of MAPbI3 with 12-ethanedithiol ( EDT ) can increase the average PL lifetime up to ~240 ns  which is close to that in the single crystals ( ~330 ns ) 106107 As expected  the Voc of the perovskite solar cell increased with decreasing density of defects after passivation  Some molecules were introduced to passivate the under-coordinated Pb and I simultaneously  for example  benzylamine and Cu ( thiourea ) I66108109 The amino group in benzylamine can not only coordinate with under-coordinated Pb thorough N atom but also form hydrogen bonds via under-coordinated I and H atoms in benzylamine  Similarly  Cu ( thiourea ) I can interact with the defective perovskites by not only supplying iodide to fill the halide vacancies but also chelating the under-coordinated halide anions with the electropositive copper atoms  Correspondingly  the trap state energy can be decreased from 035-045 to 025–035 eV after Cu ( thiourea ) I passivation108 Furthermore  the incorporated Cu ( thiourea ) I can participate in constructing the p-i bulk heterojunctions with perovskites  being advantageous for accelerating hole transport and reducing charge carrier recombination  On the other hand  benzylamine modified FAPbI3 solar cells exhibit a champion efficiency of 192 % and an Voc of 112 V with a loss-in-potential of only 036 V for FAPbI3 devices66 Recently  a quarternary ammonium halide with a structure of NR4+X−  where R is an alkyl or aryl group and X is halide  was developed to passivate charged defects in perovskite110 The defects passivation reduces the Voc loss of the p-i-n structured device to 039 V and boosts the efficiency to a certified value of 2059 ± 045 %  In addition to increase the device efficiency  surface passivation can also improve the device stability of perovskite solar cells  If perovskite films can be passivated by organic molecules with a hydrophobic side chain  such as amine-functionalized graphene and silane with long organic chains111112 the moisture-resistant property is likely to be improved  Taken trichloro ( 333-trifluoropropyl ) silane as an example  the surface modification makes water-resistant perovskite films by extremely hydrophobic fluoro groups  Impressively  the perovskite devices with a fluoro-silane layer without further encapsulation showed a negligible color change even soaked in water for 3 min  while the control device with 20 nm Phenyl−C61-butyric acid methyl ester changed to yellow within less than 5 s113 In addition to the long hydrophobic side chain  the short side chain with branch structure can also work  The tetra-ethyl ammonium with three ethyl side chains can hinder the moisture attack efficiently  The functionalized films were stable under a high relative humidity of 90 ± 5 % for more than 30 days114 More importantly  the suitable steric arrangement of small molecules on perovskite films is also critical for preventing the moisture attack  As mentioned above  benzylamine passivation can greatly increase the photovoltaic performance of perovskite devices  The benzylamine passivated perovskite films can stabilize for more than four months in humid air ( 55 ± 5 RH % ) without any degradation ( Fig  4e )  Theoretical simulations show that benzylamine molecules are edge-on packing on the perovskite surface  which can prevent the moisture attack effectively66 Photo curing of perovskite films “ Photo curing ” means the photovoltaic performance of solar cell devices further increases by light soaking87 The phenomenon has been observed in perovskite solar cells with various device structures115116117 However  the significance of the light soaking effects varied between laboratories and the underlying mechanism is still under debate  One of the proposed mechanisms is that light irradiation can remove or de-activate these defects via chemical reaction  resulting in a longer PL lifetime115118119 For example  the PL quantum yield of MAPbI3 can be increased by more than three orders of magnitude upon light irradiation  The PL lifetime increases from initial ~3 ns to 200 ns in the course of light irradiation119 After illumination  the trap density decreased from 17 × 1017 to ~25 × 1016 cm−3 for the fresh MAPbI3 film115 In addition to illumination induced defects de-activation  a strong correlation between the increase in photoluminescence over time under illumination and a redistribution of iodine away from the illuminated region was demonstrated by the time-of-flight secondary-ion-mass spectrometry115 Recently  Mohite and co-workers found that light could lead to a uniform lattice expansion in FA07MA025Cs005PbI3 thin films with reduced defect density  which increases the power conversion efficiency from 185 to 205 % 120 Apart from light irradiation  oxygen or H2O may be an important part for the curing reaction118119 For example  Stranks and co-workers reported that MAPbI3 films illuminated in dry nitrogen shows a small rise in emission  and the internal Photoluminescence quantum efficiency ( PLQE ) reaches a value of η = 12 %  When the film is illuminated instead in dry air  the photoluminescence ( PL ) rises substantially and the internal PLQE approaches η = 48 % and continues to slowly rise ( Fig  4f )  When the film is light soaked in humidified air ( 45 % relative humidity )  the internal PLQE plateaus at η = 89 %  This is approaching PLQE values in which almost all of the non-radiative decay processes are eliminated121 It is supposed that the application of light with the right level of humidity causes electrons to bond with oxygen and form superoxide  which could prevent defects from trapping electrons  The presence of humidity converted the perovskite surface into a protective shell  which removes defects from the surface and locks in the superoxide  making the healing effect last much longer115 Alternatively  reactive oxygen species could possibly passivate halide vacancies118 In addition to perovskite composition  the light-soaking phenomenon may also be related to the microstructure of perovskite films  Solar cells with noncompact perovskite morphology show a severe light soaking effect  with the PCE being improved from 37 to 116 % after light soaking116 Devices with compact perovskite morphology usually show a negligible light soaking effect  with PCE slightly increased from 114 to 119 %  Substrate modification It is believed that the nature of substrate materials would affect an induction period in the growth of the perovskite films122123 Previous results have also proved that substrate modification is an effective way to enhance the coverage ratio of perovskite films124 Besides  the nature of the substrate would affect the energetic alignment of perovskite films deposited on top122125 In this part  we mainly emphasize the modification by the Cl−  Li+  and C60 derivatives for lower defect density in perovskite layers  TiO2 is a typical electron transport material for perovskite solar cell device  However  the deep traps in TiO2 would result in charge accumulation and recombination loss126 An effective passivation approach is to modify TiO2 with Cl−127 Besides reducing the defects in TiO2  the formation of Pb-Cl bonds at the interface could also suppress Pb-I antisite defects in the adjacent perovskite ( Fig  5a )  A typical example was demonstrated by Sargent and co-workers128 They fabricated Cl-capped TiO2 through the reaction of TiCl4 and benzyl alcohol  Cl-capped TiO2 based perovskite devices exhibit a charge-recombination lifetime of 145 μs ( deduced from an open-circuit-voltage decay experiment )  much longer than that on TiO2 devices ( Figs  5b  c )  The PCE of MAPbI3 solar cells based on Cl-capped TiO2 can reach up to 201 and 195 % for active areas of 0049 and 11 cm2  respectively  Another impressive atom to modify TiO2 is lithium ( Li )  This can be accomplished with a facial post-treatment of TiO2 films with lithium salts  which can induce a partial reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ and passivate the trap states from oxygen vacancies within the TiO2 lattice129 Correspondingly  Li+-treated devices display up to over an order of magnitude faster charge transport than the untreated devices over the whole range of current densities  which could enhance charge separation and electron transport at the TiO2/perovskite interface  Fig  5 figure 5

delocalized Pb-Cl antisite defects are seen for the PbCl2-terminated interface  c Normalized transient photovoltage decay of solar cells with TiO2 and TiO2-Cl as electron transport layers128 d Schematic diagram of SAM induced permanent dipole formation and involvement of the SAM in the crystalline structure of perovskite crystals  SEM images of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites on e bare ZnO and f ZnO/C3-SAM124 Full size image Amino acids were also developed to modify the inorganic substrates112 The amino acid can be immobilized onto metal oxides through carboxyl groups  The end amino group would favor the growth of perovskite films with reduced non-radiative recombination  For example  a glycine modified TiO2 surface improves the coverage of MAPbI3 films130 Amino acids could also modify other substrates  such as Tin oxide ( SnO2 ) and Zinc oxide ( ZnO )  to passivate the perovskite films and facilitate interfacial charge transfer126 3−aminopropanoic acid would not only induce the growth of plate-like crystals  but also improve the energy level alignment with an extra permanent dipole ( Figs  5d  e ) 124 Yang and co-workers also compared SnO2 modified with different organic molecules and investigated the role of end groups in determining the interfacial optoelectronic properties and device performance131 They found that substrates with 4-pyridine carboxylic acid modification exhibit striking improvements of perovskite devices to reach a highest PCE of 188 %  which constitutes an about 10 % enhancement compared to bare SnO2  In addition to Cl−  Li+  and amino acids  Fullerene ( C60 ) is another attractive candidate to decrease the non-radiative recombination at the perovskite/TiO2 heterojunction because of its desirable optoelectronic properties  Snaith and co-workers have systematically studied the modification of substrates by C60 and its derivatives  Upon introducing C60-substituted benzoic acid self-assembled monolayer ( C60-SAM ) to the TiO2 surface through the carboxylic acid anchoring group  the PL is almost entirely quenched and PLQE is 05 %  much lower than that on a bare TiO2 substrate ( 38 % ) 132 They also replaced TiO2 with C60 in a regular n-i-p architecture and improved electronic coupling between the C60 and perovskite conduction bands and reduced nonradiative decay at this contact133 Further doping C60 with N-DPBI  4‐ ( 13‐dimethyl‐23‐dihydro‐1H‐benzimidazol‐2‐yl ) ‐N  N‐diphenylaniline  enabled stronger and faster PL quenching from perovskite films  indicating enhanced electron extraction  Due to these advancements  the highest J–V scanned PCE was 183 % in MAPbIxCl3–x perovskite devices  Moreover  the N-DPBI–doped C60 could stabilize nonencapsulated devices comprising a FA083Cs017Pb ( I06Br04 ) 3 absorber layer for up to 650 h stressing with only 20 % efficiency loss under full sun illumination in ambient conditions134 Conclusion and outlook We summarize the defect properties in perovskite films  their effects on solar cell performance  as well as the methodologies and materials to reduce defect density with improved power conversion efficiency  It is now accepted that a decreased defect density in perovskite films with less non-radiative recombination loss is critical to approach the thermodynamic limit of devices  Noted that the deep defect states and the formation mechanism are still not completely clear  even though the formation energies of different defects in perovskites have been theoretically estimated  The excellent achievements of perovskites with mixed cations and anions make us believe that the most important step for enhancing PCE should be the development of suitable perovskite compositions with higher defect-tolerance  Besides  subtract modification  additives  photo-curing  large grain size  or suitable methodologies are required for achieving the perovskite films with high crystallinity and lower defect density  Lastly  post-treatment is very important for reducing the inevitable surface dangling bonds during the film formation process  In these approaches  the chemical structure of added molecules is important for not only the charge carrier transfer process but also the stability of devices  The defects related hysteresis and ions migration could also be improved upon solving the defects issue  Therefore  in-depth fundamental understanding of these defects and development of more efficient methods to reduce the defect density will not only promote to approach the efficiency of the Shockley–Queisser limit  but also reduce hysteresis and improve the long-term stability of devices  Another attractive straightforward method for fewer defects would be the formation of single crystalline perovskite films  The challenges are to control the thickness of perovskite single crystals and assemble the devices with effective carrier transfer  Since the defect density in perovskite films is still higher than that of single crystals  there is still room to further reduce defect density  especially for perovskite devices based on flexible substrates  Up to now  deployment of flexible perovskite devices is still in the initial stage with its focus on finding suitable flexible substrates and electrodes  It is expected that the PCE of flexible devices based on perovskite films would be greatly increased after addressing the defects issues through suitable substrates  substrate modification  materials engineering and post-treatment approaches  Data availability The data that support the findings of this study are available from the

August 2018 ; revised : 16 November 2018 ; accepted : 24 November 2018 ) Abstract : The trend toward lead-free or lead-less perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) has attracted increasing attention over the past few years because the toxicity of lead ( Pb ) is one of the substantial restrictions for large-scale applications  Researchers have investigated the viability of substituting Pb with other elements ( group 14 elements  group 2 elements  transition-metal elements  and group 13 and 15 elements ) in the three-dimensional ( 3D ) perovskites by theoretical calculations and experimental explorations  In this paper  recent research progress in Pb-less and Pb-free PSCs on the perovskite compositions  deposition methods  and device structures are summarized and the main problems that hinder the enhancement of device efficiency and stability are discussed in detail  To date  the fully Sn-based PSCs have shown a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 812 % and poor device stability  However  lead-less PSCs have shown higher PCE and a better stability  In addition  the introduction of double-perovskite materials also draws researchers ’ attention  We believe that the engineering of elemental composition  perovskite deposition methods  and interfacial modification are critical for the future development of Pb-less and Pb-free PSCs  Keywords : perovskite solar cells ; lead-free perovskite materials ; lead-less perovskite materials ; composition engineering ; stability 1  Introduction The development of dye-sensitized solar cells ( DSSCs ) has slowed in recent years  The power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of these devices is difficult to increase because of dyes ’ limited light-harvesting ability  In 2009  Miyasaka ’ s group used organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials ( CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3 ) as a dye in a DSSC for the first time [ 1 ]  Although the perovskite dyes decomposed easily in the liquid electrolyte  the device showed a PCE of 38 %  Since then  inorganic–organic perovskite materials ( eg  CH3NH3PbI3 ) have been a research hotspot in the photovoltaics field because of their excellent semiconductor properties  which include a narrow bandgap  high absorption coefficient  high carrier mobility  and low exciton binding energy [ 2–5 ]  In 2012  the use of solid hole-transporting materials ( HTMs ) remarkably improved the devices ’ PCE and stability [ 6 ] ; these all-solid perovskite-based photovoltaic devices were collectively called perovskite solar cells ( PSCs )  To date  PSCs have achieved a certified PCE of 233 % [ 7 ]  Their low fabrication cost and compatibility with solution-processing methods make the commercialization of PSCs viable  PSCs have three basic structures : mesoscopic  planar  and inverted architectures [ 8 ]  The mesoscopic PSCs  which contained metallic oxide nanostructures ( eg  nanoparticles  nanotubes  nanosheets  or nanorods ) as electron transporting materials ( ETMs )  are evolved from DSSCs  and the device structure is often denoted as “ Transparent conductive oxide ( TCO ) /compact ETM/nanostructured ETM/perovskite/HTM/ back electrode ” ( see Fig  1 ( a ) ) [ 9–11 ]  The role of these nanostructured ETMs is to enhance light harvesting and electronic collection efficiency ; for instance  nanorod-like TiO2 or ZnO could provide ordered straightforward nanochannels for electron transfer [ 12–14 ]  Planar PSCs do not include this nanostructured ETM ( see Fig  1 ( b ) )  and  if the ETM and HTM are exchanged  the device is called an “ inverted PSC ” ( see Fig  1 ( c ) ) [ 15–17 ]  The selective transporting ma- 388 Int  J  Miner  Metall  Mater  Vol  26  No  4  Apr  2019 terials can not only transport the corresponding carriers but also block the carriers of opposite charge  The common ETMs include TiO2  ZnO  SnO2  [ 66 ] -phenyl-C61-butyrica acid methyl ester ( PCBM )  C60 and so on [ 18–25 ]  whereas HTMs include 22 ’ 77 ’ -tetrakis- ( N  N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine ) - 99 ’ -spirobifluorene ( Spiro-OMeTAD )  poly [ bis ( 4-phenyl ) ( 246- trimethylphenyl ) amine ] ( PTAA )  poly ( 3-hexylthiophene25-diyl ) ( P3HT )  CuI  CuSCN  NiO  and poly ( 34-ethylenedioxythiophene ) /poly ( styrenesulfonate ) ( PEDOT : PSS )  among others [ 2126–27 ]  The perovskite layer is the core part of the device  and the perovskite film quality directly affects the device ’ s PCE  The basic deposition methods of perovskites include a single-step method and a two-step method  In the single-step method  the raw materials ( eg  lead halide  methylamine halide ) are dissolved in the solvent ( eg  N  N-dimethylformamide ( DMF ) ) to prepare the perovskite precursor solution ; the solution is then spin-coated or doctor-blade-coated onto the substrate  followed by an annealing treatment [ 628 ]  In some reports  antisolvent dripping is used in the spin-coating process to ensure good perovskite morphology [ 29–31 ]  By contrast  in the two-step method  a PbI2 film is prepared on the substrate first and the PbI2-coated substrate is subsequently reacted with CH3NH3I ( MAI )  followed by an annealing treatment [ 32–34 ]  Fig  1  Schematic of the basic structures of ( a ) mesoscopic  ( b ) planar  and ( c ) inverted PSCs  Although PSCs can exhibit excellent PCEs  the poor stability of perovskite absorbers is a challenging problem  The chemical formula of the perovskite phase used in PSCs is ABX3  where A is a monovalent cation ( eg  Cs+  CH3NH3 +  or CH ( NH2 ) 2 + )  B is a divalent metal cation ( eg  Pb2+ or Sn2+ )  and X is a halide ion ( eg  Cl−  Br−  or I− ) [ 35 ]  Perovskite materials will decompose quickly under moisture or heat [ 36–38 ] ; thus  the lifetime of PSCs is much shorter than that of Si-based solar cells  In addition  most of the efficient PSCs have been fabricated with a lead halide [ 10–1139–42 ]  and Pb2+  as a heavy-metal ion  is harmful to the environment and to human health  Therefore  the Pb2+ released from the unstable perovskites poses an environmental hazard  which is another huge obstacle to the commercialization of PSCs  Solutions such as optimizing the perovskite ’ s composition [ 43–46 ]  passivating the perovskite grain boundaries [ 47–49 ]  and modifying the interfaces between the perovskite and carrier-transporting layers [ 50–52 ] have been used to prevent or retard perovskite degradation  However  these approaches are insufficient to enable the industrial application of PSCs  To produce low-toxicity PSCs with high efficiency  the most effective approach is to find a less toxic element to partially or fully substitute Pb in the devices  In this review  we summarize some recent works on Pb-less and Pb-free perovskites for photovoltaic applications  The semiconductor properties and photovoltaic performance of the Pb-less and Pb-free perovskites are discussed systematically  and the merits and shortcomings of the perovskites prepared with different substitutions of Pb  such as those substituted with group 14  2  13  and 15 elements and transition-metal elements are compared in detail  We emphasize that optimizing the perovskite composition  perovskite deposition methods  and the device structures are the most promising approaches to fabricating highly efficient  low-toxic  and stable PSCs in the future  2  Design and application of lead-less and lead-free perovskite materials in PSCs Generally  The crystal structure of ABX3 perovskite-structured phases is determined by the Goldschmidt ’ s tolerance_factor t and octahedral_factor μ : AX BX trr rr =+ + ( ) / 2 ( ) ( 1 ) μ = r r B X / ( 2 ) where rA  rB  and rX represent the radii of A  B  and X  respectively  To form an efficient three-dimensional ( 3D ) perovskite structure  the radii of the three ions must meet the conditions 081 < t < 111 and 044 < μ < 090 [ 2153–54 ]  If the value of t is too small  the compound can not form the perovskite structure ; if the value of t is too large  the compound forms a low-dimensional perovskite structure  When the t value is between 089 and 10  the compound shows a stable cubic structure ( see Fig  2 ) because the lattice distortion is smaller than that associated with the octahedral or tetragonal structure  According to the tolerance_factor and octahedral factor  the chemical composition of the perovskite structure has been constantly optimized to stabilize the pe- HY  Zhang et al  Research progress in lead-less or lead-free three-dimensional perovskite … 389 rovskite crystal lattice [ 3655–58 ]  Meanwhile  the two aforementioned empirical parameters can be used to predict the elements in the periodic table that are candidates for substituting Pb in the perovskite structure  Over the past few years  many research groups have studied the potential substitutions of Pb on the basis of theoretical calculations and experimental experiments  and the reported elements used to prepare Pb-less or Pb-free perovskites are summarized in Fig  3  In the following sections  we will discuss these substitution works in detail  Fig  2  Schematic of the cubic structure of perovskite  The B cation is surrounded by six X anions  forming a symmetric octahedron  The A cation is surrounded by 12 X anions  forming a cuboctahedron  Fig  3  Periodic table showing elements reportedly substituted for Pb in the perovskite structure  21  Group 14 elements 221  Sn substitution As a suitable element to substitute Pb in the perovskite structure  the most obvious choice is Sn or Ge  Because Ge  Sn  and Pb are in the same main group  the three elements should have similar chemical properties  In 2014  Ogomi et al  [ 59 ] introduced Sn into the fabrication of PSCs for the first time  They prepared various Sn-substituted perovskite films via a single-step spin-coating method and investigated the change in the perovskite ’ s optical properties and photovoltaic performance with increasing Sn content  They found that Sn substitution reduced the perovskite ’ s optical bandgap and extended the absorption onset into the infrared region  When the Sn content was 50mol %  the band-edge wavelength was 1060 nm  showing a 260-nm red shift compared with that for the MAPbI3 perovskite  To match the changed conduction-band minimum of the perovskite  a new HTM  poly ( 3-hexylthiophene-25-diyl ) ( P3HT )  was used in the mesoscopic MAPbxSn1−xI3-based PSC  However  the optimized MAPb05Sn05I3-based PSC only achieved a PCE of 418 %  and the 100 % Sn-based PSC showed a PCE of 0 %  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis demonstrated that the Sn2+ was easily oxidized to Sn4+  which led to self-doping effect that increased charge combination in the perovskite and thus adversely affected device performance  Noel et al  [ 60 ] fabricated MASnI3-based mesoscopic PSCs with mesoscopic TiO2 and Al2O3 substrates  Notably  the mesoscopic TiO2-based device achieved a PCE of 64 % and its open-circuit voltage ( Voc ) of 088 V and short-circuit current density ( Jsc ) of 168 mA⋅cm−2 were very similar to those of the reference MAPbI3-based PSC  However  the device based on mesoporous Al2O3 showed a negligible PCE  suggesting that the as-prepared Sn-based perovskite film had a short carrier diffusion length  The authors estimated the carrier mobility and diffusion length of MASnI3 to be 16 cm2 ⋅V−1 ⋅s −1 and 30 nm  respectively  and attributed the short diffusion length to recombination with self-doping carriers  Hao and co-workers [ 61 ] introduced Br into the MASnI3 perovskite to engineer its bandgap ( see Fig  4 [ 61 ] )  They dissolved the synthesized MASnI1−xBrx powder into DMF and then spin-coated the perovskite precursor solution onto the mesoporous substrate to prepare the MASnI1−xBrx films  The characterization results demonstrated that  with increasing x in MASnI3−xBrx  the perovskite ’ s optical bandgap increased  and the PSC ’ s incident photon-to-current efficiency ( IPCE ) onset showed a substantial blue shift  When x = 2  the PSC achieved the highest PCE of 573 %  390 Int  J

] reported that SnF2 could effectively slow the oxidation of Sn2+ and improve the film quality and stability of Sn-based perovskites  With this SnF2 additive  they constructed an FASnI3-based mesoscopic PSC with a PCE of 21 %  SnF2 has since been widely applied to fabricate Sn-based PSCs  Liao et al  [ 63 ] fabricated a compact FASnI3 perovskite film via an antisolvent-assisted single-step method  and the corresponding inverted PSC achieved a PCE of 622 %  An illumination stability test of the encapsulated device showed that its PCE decreased only 58 % from its initial efficiency within 30 d The authors speculated that the perovskite deposition method and device structure were critical to the fabrication of highly efficient Pb-free PSCs  Ke et al  [ 64 ] added ethylenediammonium { en } to the perovskite precursor solution and prepared a new perovskite material  { en } FASnI3  They found that en could effectively increase the bandgap of perovskite as a result of massive Schottky-type defects  and the { en } FASnI3-based PSC achieved a PCE of 714 %  After a 1000-h aging process  the device with encapsulation retained 96 % of its initial PCE  indicating that the incorporation of en improved device stability  Subsequently  the authors increase the PCE of { en } FASnI3-based PSC to 723 % by using a novel material  tetrakis-triphenylamine ( TPE )  as the HTM [ 65 ]  Zhao et al  [ 66 ] prepared FA–MA mixed Sn-based perovskite films via an antisolvent-assisted single-step method and investigated the effect of organic-cation mixing on the optical properties and photovoltaic performance of Sn-based perovskite films  They found that increasing the FA content could improve the film morphology and modulate the perovskite ’ s energy level  When 10mol % SnF2 was added to the perovskite precursor solution  the resultant FA075MA025SnI3-based inverted PSC exhibited a PCE of 812 %  They attributed the improved performance to an enhancement of the device ’ s Voc through composition engineering  Moreover  Yokoyama et al  [ 67 ] reported a vapor-assisted solution-process that could increase the Sn-based perovskite film coverage and thus overcome the device ’ s short-circuit phenomenon  Xi et al  [ 68 ] fabricated a Sn-based PSC on a flexible substrate and achieved a PCE of 312 %  Marshall et al  [ 69 ] fabricated a HTM-free CsSnI3-based PSC with a PCE of 356 %  Ran et al  [ 70 ] used a mixed perovskite with a 2D–3D bulk heterojunction structure as light harvester and fabricated a Sn-based PSC with a PCE of 698 %  Some other researchers found that replacing the organic cation with Cs+ in the perovskite enabled the fabrication of an all-inorganic perovskite with high thermal stability [ 71 ]  and they used CsSnI3−xBrx as perovskite absorber to fabricate solar cells [ 72–78 ]  Obviously  the development of Pb-free PSCs has been showing a tendency toward diversification  According to the aforementioned reports  we find that the PCEs of Sn-based PSCs are still much lower than those of Pb-based PSCs  Notably  the oxidation tendency of Sn2+ is a substantial roadblock for the enhancement of device ’ s stability and PCE  Nevertheless  it has been revealed that partial substitution of Pb with Sn in the PSC can mitigate the oxidation of Sn2+  and the PSC based on the Sn–Pb mixed perovskite could possess a better photovoltaic performance [ 59 ]  Zhu et al  [ 79 ] replaced 10mol % of Pb in the perovskite film with Sn and constructed a MASn01Pb09I3-based inverted PSC  They found that a dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ) vapor-assisted annealing treatment was beneficial to preparing a compact Sn–Pb mixed perovskite film with large and HY  Zhang et al  Research progress in lead-less or lead-free three-dimensional perovskite … 391 smooth grains and that the device achieved a PCE of 1025 %  Zuo et al  [ 80 ] replaced partial PbCl2 with SnCl2 in the perovskite precursor solution to prepare a Pb-less PSC  Through a time-resolved scanning electron microscopy study of the perovskite growth  they found that Sn2+ induced a dynamic morphological modulation during the annealing process because of the effect of Sn2+ on nucleation and growth  This modulation promoted the formation of a highly covered perovskite film  When the Sn content was 15mol %  the better film morphology reduced charge recombination and improved carrier transport  thus increasing the inverted PSC ’ s fill factor ( FF )  Meanwhile  the enhanced light absorption increased the short-circuit current density ( Jsc )  Finally  the device exhibited a maximum PCE of 101 %  Some researchers have found that  in the two-step spin-coating method  adding dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) to the PbI2/SnI2 precursor solution led to the formation of a “ PbI2–DMSO–SnI2 ” adduct  which was beneficial to preparing a compact perovskite film with a large grain size [ 81–83 ]  The 25mol % Sn-substituted PSC based on this deposition method could achieve a PCE of approximately 14 %  In general  there are more defects at grain boundaries than in the grains  If the perovskite film has a larger grain size  fewer grain boundaries are formed  resulting in reduction of the defect density of the perovskite film  A lower defect density will reduce carrier recombination in the PSC  enhancing the device ’ s PCE  Furthermore  Liu et al  [ 83 ] reported that the introduction of C60 as an additive to the PbI2/SnI2 solution could tune the perovskite crystallization and that the C60 at the grain boundaries exhibited a passivating effect  which decreased the trap-state density  The resultant MASn025Pb075I3-based inverted PSC with C60 additive demonstrated a higher PCE and a smaller hysteresis effect than a reference PSC  In addition  the C60 could prevent the penetration of moisture and oxygen  enhancing the device ’ s stability in the ambient atmosphere  The first principles calculations demonstrated that 50mol % Sn substitution for Pb in the perovskite could not only broaden the absorption region but also balance the electron- and hole-transporting properties and that the 50:50 ( molar ratio ) Sn–Pb mixed perovskite would exhibit better anti-oxygenation [ 84 ]  Therefore  a MASn05Pb05I3-based PSC should display enhanced photovoltaic performance in comparison with the analogous MAPbI3-based PSC  Hao et al  [ 85 ] investigated the optical properties of an Sn–Pb mixed perovskite ( MASnxPb1−xI3 ) based on the alloyed perovskite solid solutions of MASnxPb1−xI3  They found that the perovskites ’ bandgaps did not show a linear trend ( Vegard ’ s law ) with increasing x value and that the MASnxPb1−xI3 perovskites exhibited a smaller bandgap than MASnI3 when x = 025  05  or 075  Finally  the MASn05Pb05I3-based PSC showed a PCE ( 727 % ) lower than that of the MAPbI3-based one ( 831 % ) ; however  it had a broader IPCE onset and its Jsc reached ~20 mA⋅cm−2  Li et al  [ 86 ] successfully prepared a flat and compact MASn05Pn05I3 perovskite film via a two-step spin-coating method  Using this highly covered perovskite film  they fabricated an inverted PSC that exhibited an excellent PCE of 136 %  Xu and co-workers [ 87 ] used ascorbic acid as an additive in the fabrication of FA05MA05Pb05Sn05I3-based PSCs  Ascorbic acid  as an antioxidant  retarded the oxidation of Sn2+  and the resultant PSC achieved a PCE of 1401 %  Kapil et al  [ 88 ] speculated that interfacial engineering could improve the performance of the 50mol % Sn-substituted PSC ( see Fig  5 [ 88 ] )  They prepared the Sn-substituted perovskite via an antisolvent-assisted single-step method and inserted a PCBM layer between C60 and FA05MA05Sn05Pb05I3 perovskite to fabricate an inverted planar PSC  Interfacial traps in the PSC were reduced remarkably  the device ’ s Voc increased from 068 to 075 V  and the PCE reached 176 %  Lee and Kang [ 89 ] investigated the effect of Br substitution on the photovoltaic performance of the MASn06Pb04I3-based PSC  In their work  Br could improve the crystallinity and coverage of the perovskite  When the Br content was 40mol % in the perovskite  the carrier combination was effectively suppressed and the device achieved a PCE of 121 %  Liao et al  [ 90 ] combined FASnI3 with MAPbI3 in different ratios in the perovskite precursor solution to investigate the effects of the MAPbI3 content on the film-formation behavior  optical behavior  and carrier dynamics of the perovskite  They found that  when the mole ratio of FASnI3 and MAPbI3 was 6:4  the mixed perovskite exhibited a compact and uniform morphology  a broader absorption range  and a longer carrier lifetime compared with the FASnI3 perovskite analog  The inverted PSC prepared with the ( FASnI3 ) 06 ( MAPbI3 ) 04 perovskite achieved an excellent PCE of 1508 %  After the thickness of perovskite absorber was optimized  the device ’ s PCE increased to 176 % and the external quantum efficiencies in the wavelength range from 700 to 900 nm were greater than 70 % [ 91 ]  Notably  in these works  the Jsc values of the mixed perovskite devices were greater than 26 mA⋅cm−2  which is higher than those of highly efficient Pb-based PSCs [ 1192–93 ]  demonstrating the advantage of the Sn–Pb mixed perovskite ’ s wide absorption range  392 Int  J  Miner  Metall  Mater  Vol  26

MAI vapor in a chemical vapor deposition process  When the Sn content was 62wt %  the as-constructed PSC achieved a PCE of 1404 %  Tsai et al  [ 95 ] fabricated HTM-free carbon-based mesoscopic solar cells with Sn–Pb mixed perovskites  They substituted PbI2 with SnCl2 or SnI2 in the perovskite precursor solution to synthesize the MASnyPb1−yI3-xClx perovskite  and they found that the incorporation of SnCl2 modified the lattice structure  resulting in optical and optoelectronic properties that included an anomalous transition  When the Sn content was increased  SnCl2-doped and SnI2-doped perovskite presented different variations of the bandgaps and band energy  With the introduction of SnF2 additive in the precursor solution  the MASn075Pb025I3−xClx-based PSC achieved a PCE of 435 %  which showed a slight degradation in a N2-filled glovebox after 4000 h When an NiO layer was added as a HTM  the device ’ s efficiency increased to 513 %  The results related to the aforementioned Sn-containing PSCs are summarized in Table 1  The results in the table show that the device structures and perovskite deposition methods of Pb-based PSCs are also applicable to Sn-containing PSCs  Currently  the efficiency and device stability of fully Sn-based PSCs remain unsatisfactory  The oxidation of Sn2+  which will induce the recombination of self-doping carriers  is difficult to control  This problem is the single biggest obstacle to the enhancement of the performance of the Sn-based PSC  Compared with the fully Sn-based perovskites  the Sn–Pb mixed perovskites demonstrate better film controllability ; that is  a compact  highly covered and defect-less Sn–Pb mixed perovskite film can be prepared more easily  More importantly  after the Sn-to-Pb ratio is adjusted  the perovskite film can exhibit a wider absorption range than the fully Pb-based and fully Sn-based perovskite films  Therefore  the Sn–Pb mixed PSCs exhibit better photovoltaic performance than Sn-based devices  Despite these advantages  the development of Sn-containing PSCs severely lags that of Pb-based PSCs  Future efforts should be devoted to enhancing the film quality ( eg  passivating grain boundaries  enlarging the size of perovskite grains )  reducing interfacial traps ( eg  interfacial engineering )  and preventing the oxidation of Sn2+ ( eg  utilizing additives and encapsulation )  222  Ge substitution Krishnamoorthy et al  [ 96 ] explored the possibility of substituting Pb with Ge substitution in the PSCs on the basis of density of states ( DOS )

optical properties of MAPbI3  MASnI3  MAGeI3  and MASrI3  They found that the lattice distortion induced by the metal ions whose radii are smaller than that of Pb2+ led to a diminished p–p transition and a larger carrier effective mass  The metal ions ’ outer ns 2 electrons were critical to the perovskites ’ electronic and optical properties  Therefore  the simple replacement of Pb with Sn  Ge  or Sr did not enhance the devices ’ PCE  It was suggested that alternative metal or metallic clusters should have the same ionic radius and outer ns 2 electron configuration as Pb2+  In summary  the construction of Ge-based PSCs appears to be more difficult than those of Pb- and Sn-based PSCs because of the poor stability of Ge-based perovskites ; and attempts to prepare Ge-based devices are correspondingly rare  More attention should be devoted to the compositional engineering and development of selective contacts for Ge-containing PSCs  Ge–Pb mixed perovskites  for example  might behave better  22  Group 2 elements Alkaline-earth-metal cations  belonging to group 2  have the same valence ( +2 ) as Pb2+ and are more stable than Sn2+ and Ge2+  Notably  the radii of Sr2+ and Pb2+ are nearly identical [ 99 ]  Jacobsson et al  [ 100 ] studied the property of MASrI3 by coupled cluster and density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations  Their calculation results showed that strontium halides and lead ( II ) chloride had similar bonding patterns and that MASrI3 could form a stable phase irrespective of the electronegativity difference between Sr2+ and Pb2+ ions  However  the optical bandgap of MASrI3 was estimated to be 36 eV  suggesting that MASrI3 could not function as a light absorber in PSCs  Pazoki and co-workers [ 99 ] 394 Int  J  Miner  Metall  Mater  Vol  26  No  4  Apr  2019 explored the electronic properties of MACaI3  MASrI3  and MABaI3 using DFT calculations and estimated bandgaps of 295  36  and 33 eV  respectively  for the three compounds  They speculated that the alkaline-earth-based perovskite materials were more appropriate for use as selective contacts than for use as light absorbers  Some research groups have used PbCl2 and MAI as raw materials and have partially replaced PbCl2 with an alkaline-earth metal halide in the perovskite precursor solution to fabricate Pb-less planar PSCs via a single-step perovskite deposition procedure  For instance  Wu and co-workers [ 101 ] replaced some PbCl2 in the precursor solution with SrI2 or BaI2 to study the effect of the Sr or Ba dopant on the device ’ s photovoltaic performance  They found that both the Sr and the Ba dopants would reduce the coverage of the perovskite film  resulting in a decreasing device PCE with increasing Sr or Ba content  When 10mol % of the Pb was replaced  the Ba-doped PSC achieved a better PCE of 97 % than the PSC with the Sr-doped analog  They later replaced some of the PbCl2 with CaI2 to prepare Ca-doped perovskite films and PSCs [ 102 ]  The results showed that the Ca dopant could reduce the bandgap and extend the absorption to the visible range ; the 1mol % Ca-doped PSC achieved a higher PCE of 129 %  Zhang et al  [ 103 ] prepared a Ba-doped perovskite film by replacing the PbCl2 in the precursor solution with BaCl2  They found that the Ba dopant could induce a slight upshift in the conduction-band minimum  For the device  2mol % Ba dopant enhanced the Voc and the Jsc and an excellent PCE of 174 % was achieved  Chan and co-workers [ 104 ] replaced PbCl2 in the precursor solution with MgI2  CaI2  SrI2  or BaI2 and investigated the effects of four dopants on the morphology and photovoltaic property of perovskites  Only the Ba dopant improved the coverage of the perovskite film  Moreover  the Ba dopant could enhance the crystallinity  absorption behavior  and charge separation efficiency of the perovskites ; the device fabricated with 3mol % Ba achieved a record PCE of 149 %  In addition  the Ba-doped PSC showed a better stability than the pristine PSC  Shai et al  [ 105 ] chose the two-step spin-coating method to prepare Sr-doped perovskite films  and they found that SrCl2 substitution can influence the energy level of perovskite and increase the defect density and exciton binding energy of perovskite  The planar PSC fabricated using a perovskite with 5mol % SrCl2 achieved a maximum Voc of 111 V because of the up-shifted conduction-band maximum and the PCE reached 163 %  Lau et al  [ 106 ] introduced SrI2 into the preparation of a CsPbI2Br-based PSC  and they found that the SrI2 substitution lowered the conversion temperature of the fully inorganic perovskite  In their work  an annealing temperature of 100°C was sufficient to form the CsPb098Sr002I2Br perovskite film  and the resultant PSC achieved a PCE of 113 % and better thermal stability than the unsubstituted CsPbI2Br-based PSC  Moreover  in some reports  SrI2 and SrCl2 were used as additives in the precursor solution to prepare perovskite films  and the device ’ s charge recombination could be effectively suppressed  increasing the PCE to more than 15 % [ 107–108 ]  From the aforementioned works  we find that alkaline-earth metal salts influence the film formation and optical properties of perovskite and that substitution at a low level enhances the photovoltaic performance of PSCs ; however  the major contributor to device performance is Pb  Thus  other elements beyond alkaline-earth metals are needed to further increase the substitution amount of Pb  23  Transition-metal elements Like alkaline-earth metals  transition metals are also abundant in the Earth ’ s crust  In addition  many transition metals ’ divalent cations satisfy the requirements for the tolerance factor and octahedral_factor  with the exception of metal cations with strong reducibility or small ion radii  Some researchers have attempted to use Fe2+ [ 109 ]  Mn2+ [ 110 ]  Cu2+ [ 111–113 ]  and Pd2+ [ 114 ] as Pb2+ substitutes to prepare Pb-free perovskites ; however  the resultant compounds often show a 2D perovskite structure  which is undesirable for highly efficient PSCs  Therefore  to retain the 3D perovskite structure  partial substitution with transition metals appears to be a more reasonable approach  Frolova et al  [ 115 ] studied the effects of a series of metal-ion substitutions on the photovoltaic performance of MAPbI3-based PSCs  They replaced 10mol % PbI2 in the MAPbI3 precursor solutions with different metal iodides ( AgI  CuI  CdI2  BiI3  CoI2  NiI2  FeI2  ZnI2  and HgI2 ) and fabricated the Pb-less PSCs via an antisolvent-assisted single-step method  With the exception of HgI2  the metal iodides decreased the PCE of the device  Hg2+  however  is also a toxic metal ion that can not be used in industrial production  Jahandar et al  [ 116 ] used CuBr2 as a substitute for PbI2 in the perovskite precursor solution and investigated the effects of various CuBr2 concentrations on the film formation  electronic properties  and photovoltaic properties of the perovskite  They found that CuBr2 and DMSO could form a CuBr2– ( DMSO ) 2 adduct in the perovskite precursor film under antisolvent dripping  The CuBr2– ( DMSO ) 2 adduct would translate into a liquid phase during the annealing treatment  which facilitated the formation of a perovskite film with large grains ( see Fig  6 [ 116 ] )  At the same time  HY  Zhang et al  Research progress in lead-less or lead-free three-dimensional perovskite … 395 Cu doping could induce an increase of the carrier density  resulting in improved film conductivity  When the CuBr2 concentration in the perovskite solution was 5mol %  the Jsc and fill factor ( FF ) of the resultant inverted PSC were enhanced and a considerable PCE of 1709 % and better air stability were achieved  Jin et al  [ 117 ] found that the addition of Zn in the perovskite precursor could influence the nucleation and subsequent crystal growth processes  and a ZnCl2 dopant was beneficial for the formation of perovskite film with large grains in the antisolvent-assisted single-step method  After the optimization of the ZnCl2 concentration  the 3mol % ZnCl2-substituted planar PSC achieved a higher PCE of 182 % and showed a better stability  This improved performance was ascribed to the enlarged grain size  fully covered morphology  and decreased carrier recombination induced by the ZnCl2 substitution  Fig  6  Schematic of the device architecture of MAI ( PbI2 ) 1−x ( CuBr2 ) x planar hybrid perovskite solar cells

halide substituted CH3NH3I ( PbI2 ) 1−x ( CuBr2 ) x planar perovskite solar cells  330-339  Copyright 2016  with permission from Elsevier  Klug et al  [ 118 ] assessed the substitution feasibility of nine transition-metal species ( Co  Cu  Fe  Mg  Mn  Ni  Sn  Sr  and Zn ) for Pb-less PSCs  They replaced the lead acetate ( Pb ( Ac ) 2 ) in the perovskite precursor solution with these nine metal acetates or iodides to prepare the mixed perovskite and investigated the changes in the optical and photovoltaic properties caused by the substitutions  For most of the nine metal substitutions  the inverted PSCs were found to maintain an acceptable efficiency when the substitution content was less than 6mol %  However  when Fe was introduced into the perovskite  the device ’ s PCE decreased to a relatively low level  The Sn-substituted PSCs maintained device efficiency even when the substitution level reached 25mol %  Notably  partially Co-substituted PSCs displayed enhanced photovoltaic performance  and a PCE of 172 % was obtained for the PSC with a Pb : Co molar ratio of 63:1  With the increasing Co content  the perovskite ’ s crystal structure transformed from cubic to tetragonal phase at room temperature  Likewise  the Co substitution tuned the Fermi energy level and valence-band edge without changing the bandgap of the perovskites  which facilitated a better energy level matching between the perovskite and PEDOT : PSS when the Pb : Co molar ratio was 63:1 ; thus  the device ’ s Voc was increased to 108 V In addition  they speculated that Mg2+  Mn2+  Ni2+  and Zn2+ may behave similarly to Co2+ in the PSCs because of their similar ionic radii  air stability as divalent ions  and slight influence on the device ’ s photovoltaic performance at low doping levels  Because Sn2+ is not stable in the ambient atmosphere  the balance between device efficiency and Sn2+ content in the perovskite is a confusing problem  Li et al  [ 119 ] partially replaced PbI2 with SnI2 and CuBr2 to synthesize Pb–Sn–Cu ternary PSCs via an antisolvent-assisted single-step method  Their findings showed that the introduction of Sn2+ widens the perovskite ’ s absorption range but worsens the film quality  By contrast  the introduction of Cu2+ improved the film quality of the Sn-containing perovskite and reduced the trap density at grain boundaries without affecting the absorption  Thus  a high PCE of 2108 % was obtained for the MAPb09Sn005Cu005I29Br01-based inverted PSC because of the synergistic effect induced by Sn2+ and Cu2+  Although some transition metals ( eg  Cu and Zn ) have successfully been used in photovoltaic devices such as CuInxGa1–xSe2 ( CIGS ) [ 120 ] and Cu2ZnSnS4 ( CZTS ) [ 121–122 ] solar cells  they could only substitute less than 10mol % of the Pb in highly efficient PSCs  similar to substitution limits of the alkaline-earth metals  To further increase the substitution level of Pb  additional theoretical calculations are needed to deeply understand the energy-band construction of transition-metal-substituted 3D perovskites and deduce an appropriate chemical composition  In addition  optimization of the perovskite deposition method is also needed to suppress charge recombination  396 Int  J  Miner  Metall  Mater  Vol  26  No  4  Apr  2019 24  Group 13 and 15 elements In the previous sections  we mentioned the importance of Pb 6s electrons to the perovskite bandgap  Group 15 elements  such as Bi and Sb  can provide these extranuclear electrons  and Sb or Bi can be substituted into the perovskite structure without changing the 3D structure and forming n-type dopants because of the larger valence electron number of Sb 5p3 than that of Pb 6p2 [ 123 ]  Oku et al  [ 124 ] first substituted PbI2 with SbI3 in the perovskite precursor solution to prepare a lead-less PSC via a single-step method  They found that Sb substitution could increase the perovskite ’ s lattice constant and suppress the formation of excess PbI2  When the Sb content increased from 0mol % to 3mol %  the mesoscopic PSC ’ s PCE increased from 637 % to 847 %  Afterwards  Zhang et al  [ 123 ] prepared various Sb-doped perovskite films by replacing PbCl2 with SbI3 in the precursor solution and investigated the effects of Sb doping on the optical properties and photovoltaic performance of perovskite films  In their work  with increasing Sb content  the compound ’ s absorption onset showed a blue shift  the optical bandgap increased from 155 to 206 eV  and the n-type doping of Sb up-shifted the perovskite ’ s quasi-Fermi energy level and improved the electron transfer efficiency in the PSCs  When the Sb content was 1mol %  the device achieved an enhanced PCE of 156 %  To increase the Sb doping content and control the morphology of Sb-substituted perovskite  Chatterjee et al  [ 125 ] used a two-step method to fabricate Sb-substituted inverted PSCs  After optimizing the deposition method of perovskite  they increased the Sb content to 8mol % ; the corresponding device delivered a considerable Voc of 113 V and a PCE of 128 %  The all-inorganic CsPbI3-based PSCs exhibit better stability than the organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs ; however  the highly efficient black phase ( α-CsPbI3 ) can easily degrade to the unwanted yellow phase ( δ-CsPbI3 ) [ 126 ]  Hu et al  [ 127 ] found that Bi3+ could suppress formation of the yellow phase and decrease the conversion temperature of the black phase to 100°C  They partially replaced PbI2 with BiI3 in the perovskite precursor solution and prepared a perovskite film via a single-step spin-coating method  When the Bi content was 4mol %  the resultant planar PSC achieved a PCE of 1321 % and maintained 68 % of its initial efficiency after exposure in the ambient air for 168 h Indium ( In )  as a group 13 element  can also be substituted for Pb in the perovskite structure  Wang et al  [ 128 ] reported that InCl3 could improve the crystallization quality of perovskite films  In their work  the introduction of InCl3 increased the perovskite crystal orientation  which facilitated charge transport and  hence  enhanced device performance  When the InCl3 content was 15mol %  a high PCE of 1755 % was obtained for the Pb–In mixed PSC  Unlike divalent cations  trivalent cations substituted at high concentrations will result in the compound losing its highly efficient 3D perovskite structure  although Pb-free PSCs prepared using these low-dimensional perovskites have been reported [ 129–139 ]  However  compared with 3D-structured perovskite  the low-dimensional structure results in a high exciton binding energy and a low carrier mobility ; thus  the device ’ s PCE is often less than 2 %  The valence difference between Pb2+ and trivalent cations ( Bi3+  Sb3+  In3+ ) clearly limits the extent to which perovskite Pb can be substituted  25  Double perovskites As previously discussed  to meet the requirements of tolerance factor and valence conservation  two divalent metal ions ( eg  Sn2+ and Pb2+ ) can be used to synthesize mixed perovskites  Why not replace the two divalent metal cations with a monovalent cation ( eg  K+ Ag+  or Cu+ ) and a trivalent cation ( eg  Bi3+ or Sb3+ ) to prepare Pb-free perovskites ( see Fig  7 ) ? A new type of material called “ double perovskites  ” which is based on this design idea  has recently emerged  Slavney et al  [ 140 ] used equimolar amounts of Ag+ and Bi3+ as substitutes for toxic Pb2+ and synthesized Cs2AgBiBr6 with a 3D double-perovskite structure  The Cs2AgBiBr6 compound showed an indirect bandgap of 195 eV and a photoluminescence ( PL ) lifetime of approximately 660 ns  A comparison of the PL decay of both single-crystalline and powdered samples revealed that the Cs2AgBiBr6 compound had a high defect tolerance  Furthermore  the compound showed better heat and moisture stability than the MAPbI3 perovskite  These traits demonstrate the potential of Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite for photovoltaic applications  McClure et al  [ 141 ] synthesized Cs2AgBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiBr6 via the solid-state method and a solution method  respectively  Both compounds showed a cubic double-perovskite structure  Diffuse reflectance measurements indicated that the optical bandgaps of Cs2AgBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiBr6 were approximately 277 and 219 eV  respectively  The DOS calculation results demonstrated that the perovskite valence-band edge was characterized as the filled halogen 3p/4p states and that the conduction-band edge was defined as the antibonding Ag 5s and Bi 6p states  Furthermore  both the Cs2AgBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskites were stable under ambient atmosphere  Volonakis et al  [ 142 ] combined theoretical calculations and experiments to study a series of compounds in the double-perovskite family based on group 15 metal ions ( Bi3+  Sb3+ ) and noble-metal ions HY  Zhang et al  Research progress in lead-less or lead-free three-dimensional perovskite … 397 ( Ag+  Au+  Cu+ )  Their calculation results showed that the double perovskites possess highly tunable optical bandgaps and carrier effective masses  The authors predicted that all of the members of the double-perovskite family were indirect-gap semiconductors  Meanwhile  they synthesized a Cs2BiAgCl6 compound with a face-entered cubic structure  and optical characterization demonstrated that the compound had an indirect gap  In addition  Wei et al synthesized MA2KBiCl3 perovskite with an optical bandgap of 304 eV [ 143 ] and MA2AgBiBr3 perovskite with a bandgap of 202 eV [ 144 ]  Fig  7  Schematic crystal structure of the traditional perovskite ( a ) and double perovskites ( b )  Although some single crystals and powders in the double-perovskite family have been synthesized  they could not be used in film-based PSCs  Greul et al  [ 145 ] successfully prepared a Cs2AgBiBr6 film and constructed a Cs2AgBiBr6-based mesoscopic PSC for the first time  They found that a high-temperature annealing treatment was necessary for complete conversion of the perovskite and that a preheating treatment was beneficial for enhancing the perovskite ’ s optical properties  The resultant perovskite film exhibited a bandgap of 221 eV  consistent with a previous report [ 141 ]  The Cs2AgBiBr6-based PSC achieved a Voc greater than 1 V and a PCE of approximately 25 % ; more importantly  the device showed greater illumination and air stability than the MAPbI3-based PSC  Ning et al  [ 146 ] constructed a Cs2AgBiBr6-based planar PSC with TiO2 as the ETM  Because of the large-sized perovskite grains  the grain boundaries and carrier recombination were decreased and the double-perovskite film ’ s carrier diffusion length reached 110 nm  The device achieved a PCE of 122 %  Wu et al  [ 147 ] dissolved Cs2AgBiBr6 powder into DMSO to prepare a perovskite precursor solution  They prepared a compact perovskite film using a low-pressure-assisted spin-coating procedure  The resultant PSC with SnO2 as the ETM and P3HT as the HTM achieved a PCE of 144 %  Gao et al  [ 148 ] found that isopropanol dripping promoted the formation of smooth and uniform perovskite films with microsized grains  They fabricated an inverted Cs2AgBiBr6-based PSC with a PCE of 223 % ( Voc = 101 V ) via an antisolvent-assisted single-step method  and the efficiency only slightly decreased within 10 d in the ambient air ( 25°C  50 % RH )  As a new family  double perovskites possess a better stability than the traditional organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites  but they haven ’ t exhibit a considerable photovoltaic performance  and only Cs2AgBiBr6 was applied to construct devices at present  This is mainly ascribed to the wide indirect bandgaps  Fortunately  the double perovskite with a direct bandgap could be prepared by changing the chemical composition ; for instance  Cs2InAgCl6 has a direct bandgap [ 149 ]  Therefore  more attempts are needed to modify the bandgap and carrier mobility of double perovskites  3  Conclusion and outlook After rapid development over several years  the exploration of PSCs has entered a buffer period  Researchers are beginning to devote more attention to the commercialization of devices  where the stability and toxicity of PSCs are the most important issues  In the past few years  numerous efforts have been made to seek for a suitable candidate of Pb to fabricate Pb-less or Pb-free PSCs  Sn  as group 14 element akin to Pb  has become a most promising substitution for Pb  Sn substitution can not only lower the toxicity of PSCs but also adjust the optical bandgap and  hence  improve the light-harvesting performance of perovskite  More importantly  almost all of deposition methods of perovskites and device structures for the Pb-based PSCs can be used to fabricate Sn-containing PSCs  However  the most efficient fully Sn-based PSC shows a PCE of only 812 %  which is much lower than the PCEs of Pb-based PSCs  The greatest 398 Int  J  Miner  Metall  Mater  Vol  26  No  4  Apr  2019 problem associated with Sn-based PSCs is the oxidation tendency of Sn2+  which induces a self-doping effect and thereby increases charge recombination in the perovskite  Measures such as interfacial engineering  the introduction of SnF2 additive  and device encapsulation have been used to retard the oxidation ; however  the final effects are finite  Meanwhile  another group 14 element  Ge  shows a more unsatisfactory performance because of the same oxidation issue  The partial substitution for Pb appears to be more feasible  The bandgap transition of Sn–Pb mixed perovskites does not show a linear trend ( Vegard ’ s law ) with increasing Sn content  and the 50mol % –60mol % Sn-substituted perovskite exhibits the broadest absorption region  At the same time  the presence of Pb2+ in the perovskite can slow the oxidation of Sn2+  Until now  Sn–Pb mixed PSCs can exhibit a PCE of 176 % in devices with a Sn content of 60mol %  To maintain or enhance the photovoltaic performance of PSCs  the substitution amounts of group 2 elements  transition-metal elements  and group 13 and 15 elements are kept at low levels  Although these species can influence the film formation  optical bandgap  and defect density of perovskites  the primary contribution to device photovoltaic performance originates from Pb  In fact  the incorporation state of these metals with Pb-based perovskite is still uncertain because of the limited characterization methods  Moreover  to deeply understand the energy-band construction of alkaline-earth-metal or transition-metal-substituted 3D perovskites  more theoretical calculations should be conducted  To date  the PCEs of the PSCs fabricated with double perovskites have been less than 3 % because most of the double perovskites are indirect-bandgap semiconductors  which adversely affects their photovoltaic performance  However  double perovskites possess better air and moisture stability compared with traditional organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites  An effective way to modify the energy bands of double perovskites is to adjust their element composition  and the new double perovskites with a direct bandgap will appear soon  In conclusion  each Pb-free or Pb-less perovskite material has its attractive features  According to the present reports  the high PCEs of devices are influenced by numerous physical or chemical factors  We propose that future research toward environmentally friendly perovskite materials should be focused on the design of the elemental composition  the deposition method  and interfacial engineering  Given the hard work of an increasing number of PSC researchers  we believe that the commercialization of PSCs  and various highly efficient Pb-free or Pb-less PSC modules  will emerge in the near future  Author Correction : Solid-phase hetero epitaxial growth of α-phase formamidinium perovskiteAbstract Compositional engineering has been used to overcome difficulties in fabricating high-quality phase-pure formamidinium perovskite films together with its ambient instability  However  this comes alongside an undesirable increase in bandgap that sacrifices the device photocurrent  Here we report the fabrication of phase-pure formamidinium-lead tri-iodide perovskite films with excellent optoelectronic quality and stability  Incorporation of 167 mol % of 2D phenylethylammonium lead iodide into the precursor solution enables the formation of phase-pure formamidinium perovskite with an order of magnitude enhanced photoluminescence lifetime  The 2D perovskite spontaneously forms at grain boundaries to protect the formamidinium perovskite from moisture and suppress ion migration  A stabilized power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 2064 % ( certified stabilized PCE of 1977 % ) is achieved with a short-circuit current density exceeding 24 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit voltage of 1130 V  corresponding to a loss-in-potential of 035 V  and significantly enhanced operational

solid-state PVSK solar cell in 20121234  Rapid progress in power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) has been achieved via compositional and process engineering  As of 2017  the state-of-the-art PVSK solar cell achieved a certified PCE of 227 %  which is on par with well-established silicon solar cells56789101112  Typical PVSK absorbers employ 3D ABX3 structures  where a monovalent ‘ A-site ’ cation in the cubo-octahedral site bonds with the BX6 octahedra  Compositional engineering has been considered an important approach to enhance the stability and performance of PVSK solar cells  Important milestones have been achieved through compositional engineering  For example  incorporation of the formamidinium ( FA ) cation into the ‘ A-site ’ has enabled the formation of a cubic FAPbI3 phase with a lower bandgap ( Eg ) of 148 eV  higher absorption coefficient and longer carrier diffusion lengths than methylammonium ( MA ) -based tetragonal MAPbI3 ( Eg = 157 eV ) 6713  However  FAPbI3 has poor ambient stability because its non-PVSK hexagonal phase is thermodynamically more favorable than the cubic phase at room temperature  Partial substitution of FA and I with MA and/or Br has enabled fabrication of phase-pure FAPbI3 with improved performance and stability8  Recently  incorporation of smaller inorganic ‘ A ’ cations  such as Cs and Rb  has further improved the stability and PCE of the PVSK solar cells with the lowest open-circuit voltage ( VOC ) deficit of 039 V1415  As a result  typical high efficiency devices nowadays incorporate PVSK with FA  MA  Cs  Rb  and Br having relatively larger Eg than 160 eV1516  However  such compositional engineering has enhanced the VOC and stability at the expense of short-circuit current density ( JSC ) due to increased Eg  Utilization of pure FAPbI3 is desired in regards to its lower Eg  which is close to the optimum value for a single junction solar cell suggested by the detailed balance limit17  However  no efficient method has been developed so far to fabricate a high quality phase-pure FAPbI3 film and device  Recently  the manipulation of surface energy has been proposed as a means to stabilize metastable PVSK phases such as CsPbI3 and FAPbI3181920  Swarnkar et al  reported ambient stable α-CsPbI3 in the form of a colloidal quantum dot  in which the contribution of surface energy significantly increases due to the high surface-to-volume ratio18  Very recently  Fu et al  reported that the cubic FAPbI3 phase can be stabilized by functionalizing the surface with large-sized organic molecules19  They demonstrated that the functionalized surface contributes to lower formation_energy to stabilize the cubic FAPbI3 phase at room temperature  However  the steady-state PCE was as low as 145 %  Several attempts have been made to utilize such approach  where impressive improvements in performance and stability have been demonstrated2122232425  However  their performance and stability are still relatively poor comparing with those of MAPbI3 or mixed-cation-halide PVSK solar cells  Here we report a method to fabricate high-quality stable FAPbI3 PVSK films using 2D PVSK  Incorporation of 2D phenylethylammonium lead iodide ( PEA2PbI4 ) PVSK into precursor solution enables the formation of phase-pure FAPbI3 films with a tenfold enhancement in photoluminescence ( PL ) lifetime  The 2D PVSK is spontaneously formed at the grain boundaries of FAPbI3 to protects the FAPbI3 from moisture and assists in charge separation/collection  Thanks to the superior optoelectronic quality  we were able to fabricate a PVSK solar cell with a stabilized efficiency of 2064 % ( certified stabilized efficiency of 1977 % )  Notably  the PVSK solar cell shows a peak VOC of 1130 V  corresponding to a loss-in-potential of 035 V considering the Eg of 148 eV versus 039 V for mixed-cation-halide perovskite solar cells15  Furthermore  the device demonstrates significantly enhanced ambient and operational stability  Results Effects of 2D perovskite on phase purity of FAPbI3 FAPbI3 films were prepared by the modified adduct method  in which N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone ( NMP ) was used as a Lewis base2627  To the PVSK precursor solution  2D PVSK ( PEA2PbI4 ) precursors with different molar ratios ranging from 125 to 10 mol % were added  The steady-state PL spectra of the films were measured and are shown in Supplementary Fig  1  As seen in Fig  1a and Supplementary Fig  1  we observed no obvious changes in PL peak position until the amount of 2D PVSK reached 10 mol %  With 10 mol % PVSK  the PL peak was blue-shifted by 6 nm  The blueshift of the PL peak might be due to formation of a quasi-3D PVSK  where charge carriers are confined by large potential barrier originated from the 2D PVSK28  Based on this observation  we presume the added 2D PVSK does not result in the formation of the quasi-3D PVSK if it remains below a certain threshold  This threshold was found to be lower than 10 mol %  where this quantity was then optimized based on photovoltaic performance ( Fig  1a and Supplementary Fig  2 )  A planar heterojunction architecture consisting of Indium doped SnO2 ( ITO ) glass/compact-SnO2/PVSK/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag or Au was utilized for construction of PVSK solar cells in this study ( cross-sectional scanning electron microscopic ( SEM ) images of the device are shown in Supplementary Fig  3 )  The addition of 167 mol % 2D PVSK was found to be optimal for the photovoltaic performance ( ca  11 % improvement in PCE )  Notably  addition of 10 mol % 2D PVSK significantly degraded the PCE to lower than 1 %  which might result from formation of quasi-3D PVSK as the large potential barrier originating from 2D PVSK could hinder the charge transport  Fig  1 figure 1

diffraction patterns  c absorption and normalized PL spectra of bare FAPbI3 and FAPbI3 with 167 mol % PEA2PbI4 2D perovskite  Inset of c shows onset region of the absorption spectra with linear approximation ( solid lines ) Full size image X-ray diffraction patterns ( XRD ) of bare FAPbI3 and FAPbI3 with 167 mol % PEA2PbI4 are shown in Fig  1b  As can be seen  the bare FAPbI3 film contains hexagonal non-PVSK phase ( δ-phase ) while the PVSK film prepared with 167 mol % PEA2PbI4 shows pure PVSK phase29  Even smaller amount of 2D PVSK ( 125 mol % PEA2PbI4 ) effectively suppresses the formation of δ-phase ( Supplementary Fig  4 )  Furthermore  the overall signal intensity and full-width-half-maximum ( FWHM ) were enhanced with the addition of the 2D PVSK  indicating improved crystallinity  We speculate that the added large phenylethylammonium molecules from 2D PVSK precursors interact with FAPbI3 crystals to facilitate formation of the cubic PVSK phase during crystallization19  Such a speculation is correlated with the observation in the XRD measurements in Supplementary Fig  4  in which the signal intensity and FWHM of XRD peaks are systematically enhanced with increased amounts of the added 2D PVSK ( Supplementary Figs  4  5 )  The enhancement of preferred orientation along the ( 001 ) plane with increased 2D PVSK also indicates the added precursors of the 2D PVSK functionalize the specific crystal facet to change the surface energy during the crystal growth30  A closer inspection on the normalized X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) patterns of the PVSK films with different amounts of added 2D PVSK ( Supplementary Fig  6 ) was taken to find any correlations between the added 2D PVSK and crystal structure of FAPbI3  Interestingly  a systematic change in peak position was observed with different amounts of 2D PVSK for which the XRD peaks were slightly shifted toward higher angles with the addition of relatively smaller amounts of 2D PVSK ( 125  167  250  and 50 mol % )  This indicates that the lattice constant of FAPbI3 is reduced  likely due to compressive strain associated with the added 2D PVSK  We speculate that the reduction in lattice constant can be also related to the enhanced phase purity of cubic FAPbI3 as it will have equivalent effects with incorporation of smaller ‘ A ’ site cations on the tolerance_factor and thus enthalpy of formation31  Lower angle peaks at around 12° appear upon addition of 10 mol % 2D PVSK corresponding to the formation of quasi-3D PVSK ( inset of Supplementary Fig  4f ) 32  The pure phase PVSK film with 167 mol % PEA2PbI4 shows enhanced absorption over all wavelengths ( Fig  1c ) compared to the bare FAPbI3 film where the absorption onset is hardly changed ( Insent of Fig  1c )  The absorption onset is complemented by almost identical normalized PL spectra  which indicates that the Eg was maintained  The enhanced absorption as seen when the 2D PVSK was added is probably due to an enhanced phase purity of the FAPbI3  with partial contribution from an enhanced light scattering owing to the improved crystallinity33  The absorption spectra with different amounts of 2D PVSK are demonstrated in Supplementary Fig  7  While all the PVSK films with 2D PVSK showed enhanced absorption compared to bare FAPbI3 films  a slight blueshift of the absorption onset with decreases in absorption over the whole-wavelength region was identified with the addition of 10 mol % of 2D PVSK  which is correlated with the blueshift of the steady-state PL spectrum that can be associated with the formation of quasi-3D PVSK  Photoluminescence properties and photovoltaic performance Steady-state and time-resolved PL profiles were investigated in Fig  2a  b  The steady-state PL intensity was largely enhanced more than five times from 43 ×105 to 23 × 106 with addition of 167 mol % PEA2PbI4 into FAPbI3 film ( Fig  2a )  The large enhancement of PL intensity was attributed to a significantly elongated PL lifetime as seen in Fig  2b  The time resolved PL profiles were fitted to exponential decay  in which bi- and tri-exponential decay models were used for the bare and 2D PVSK incorporated PVSK films  respectively ( Supplementary Table 1 )  The relatively fast decay component ( τ1 around 3 ns ) was assigned to charge carrier trapping induced by trap states formed due to the structural disorder such as vacancy or interstitial defects while much slower components ( τ2  τ3 ) were assigned to free carrier radiative recombination34353637  With addition of 167 mol % 2D PVSK  proportion of the fast decay component ( τ1 ) was decreased ( from 518 % to 465 % ) while τ2 significantly elongated from 785 ns to 1487 ns  which indicates reduced defect density and enhanced charge carrier lifetime  We attributed such improvements to enhanced phase purity and crystallinity of FAPbI3 as observed from XRD measurements ( Fig  1b )  which decreases the structural disorders at grain interiors and/or boundaries38  Moreover  a new decay component ( τ3 ) with a significantly long lifetime ( > 1 μs ) appeared after addition of the 2D PVSK  which is likely related to the added 2D PVSK  As a result  the average PL lifetime was enhanced by almost one order of magnitude from 394 to 3769 ns with addition of 2D PVSK  During the optimization of the device  incorporation of 2 mol % Cs was found to further enhance the performance and reproducibility of the devices without a noticeable change in Eg ( Supplementary Figs  8–12  see Supplementary Notes 1  2 and 3 for additional discussion on the optimization process and impacts of 2 mol % Cs )  With additional 2 mol % Cs  the fraction of τ1 was further decreased  indicating a further decreased defect density  which was also observed in previous studies14  Consequently  the steady-state PL intensity and average PL lifetime was further enhanced  rationalizing the improved PCE with 2 mol % Cs ( Supplementary Table 1 )  It is worth noting that the PL lifetime was significantly reduced with 10 mol % of 2D PVSK due to formation of quasi-3D PVSK ( Supplementary Fig  13 )  Fig  2 figure 2

parenthesis are from reverse ( from VOC to JSC ) and forward scan ( from JSC to VOC )  respectively Full size image The PCE distribution of the devices incorporating corresponding the PVSKs is compared in Fig  2c ( distribution of photovoltaic parameters can be found in Supplementary Fig  14 )  The average photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Supplementary Table 2  The average PCE of the bare FAPbI3 PVSK solar cells was significantly enhanced by 13 % from 1595 ± 036 % to 1808 ± 052 % with addition of 167 mol % PEA2PbI4  The average PCE was further enhanced to 1916 ± 037 % with 2 mol % of Cs ( Hereafter  the devices based on bare FAPbI3 are denoted as control while the devices based on FA098Cs002PbI3 with 167 mol % PEA2PbI4 are denoted as target for convenience )  Current density and voltage ( J–V ) curves of the optimized control and target devices are demonstrated in Fig  1d  in which the highest PCE of the target device reached 2106 % ( JSC : 2444 mA cm−2  VOC : 1126V  FF : 0765 ) while a PCE of 1641 % was achieved with the control device ( JSC : 2423 mA cm−2  VOC : 1048V  FF : 0646 )  A stabilized PCE of 2064 % was achieved with the target device while that of control device was 1580 % ( Fig  2e )  External quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra of the devices were compared in Fig  2f  An integrated JSC of 239 mA cm−2 from the target device was well-matched with the value measured from the J–V scan ( < 5 % discrepancy )  while control device shows that of 212 mA cm−2 with a relatively large discrepancy of 14 %  The relatively large discrepancy from the control FAPbI3 device is probably due to a more pronounced hysteresis  as seen in Fig  1d  which also results in a large discrepancy between the stabilized PCE and the PCE measured from the J–V scan  The performance of control device was highly reproducible  With optimized process parameters  the average PCE of 2005 ± 045 % was demonstrated over 74 devices ( Supplementary Fig  15 )  We obtained the peak VOC of 1130 V with the target device ( Supplementary Fig  16 ) corresponding to a loss-in-potential of 035 V considering a Eg of 148 eV  which is the lowest VOC deficit reported to date for PVSK solar cells  One of the target devices was sent out for measurement in an independent laboratory and achieved a certified stabilized PCE of 1977 % ( Supplementary Fig  17 )  The current–voltage curve and EQE spectra matched well with those measured by our group ( Supplementary Fig  18 )  The enhanced device performance with 2D PVSK is mainly due to improved FF and VOC  which can be attributed to improved phase purity and elongated carrier lifetime with reduced defect density  facilitating carrier transport and reducing the charge recombination14  The reduced non-radiative recombination loss with 2D PVSK was also confirmed in devices by electroluminescence ( EL ) measurements in Supplementary Fig  19  in which maximum radiance ( 404 Wsr−1 cm−2 ) and EL EQE ( 049 % ) of the target devices were significantly enhanced compared to those of the control devices ( 287 Wsr−1 cm−2  006 % ) 15  Moisture stability and TEM analysis Under ambient conditions  a cubic FAPbI3 PVSK phase is subject to undergo conversion to a hexagonal non-PVSK phase  resulting in serious degradation in photovoltaic performance814  The phase transformation is even accelerated under high-relative humidity14  To evaluate the effects of 2D PVSK incorporation on phase stability  we investigated changes in absorbance of the film under relative humidity ( RH ) of 80 ± 5 %  Figure 3a shows photos of the PVSK film stored for different time  Bare FAPbI3 film was almost completely bleached within 24 h whereas no obvious change in color was observed from the films containing 2D PVSK both with and without Cs  Figure 3b demonstrates the absorbance ( at 600 nm ) of the FAPbI3 films with and without 2D PVSK as a function of exposure time ( individual absorption spectra can be found in Supplementary Fig  20 )  The absorbance of the bare FAPbI3 rapidly degraded during 24 h  while FAPbI3 films with 2D PVSK did not show noticeable degradation within 24 h With addition of 2 mol % Cs  the film also remained stable after 24 h The color change of the bare FAPbI3 film under high RH is due to its transformation to the δ-phase as can be seen in XRD spectra in Supplementary Fig  21a whereas no detectable change in color for the films with 2D PVSK is correlated with their neat XRD spectra without the δ-phase ( Supplementary Figs  21b  c )  The enhanced phase stability under high RH implies that the possible ingression pathway of moisture in the PVSK film is passivated  Previously  we demonstrated grain boundary engineering techniques using the adduct approach  in which the additives had precipitated at grain boundaries if not incorporated into the lattice of PVSK3438  We supposed that grain boundaries within the film  which have been reported to be ingression pathways for moisture  might be passivated by the added 2D PVSK39  Fig  3 figure 3 Improved moisture stability with 2D perovskite at grain boundaries  a Photos of the perovskite films incorporating bare FAPbI3

FA098Cs002PbI3 film with 167 mol % PEA2PbI4  Inset of c demonstrates the lower magnification image showing the polycrystalline nature with grain boundaries  The highlighted area ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) were investigated in d and e  respectively  Inset of d and e show Fast Fourier transform ( FFT ) analysis of the area within boxes  respectively Full size image Indeed  the vertically aligned 2D PVSK was sparsely observed from SEM images in Supplementary Fig  10b  c with addition of 2D PVSK ( see also Supplementary Fig  22 and Supplementary Note 4 for additional discussion )  However  the enhanced moisture stability throughout the whole-film implies that the 2D PVSK probably exist along the grain boundaries  To confirm our assumption  transmission electron microscopic ( TEM ) images of the FAPbI3 film with 2D PVSK was analyzed in Fig  3c–e  The inset of Fig  3c shows a chunk of the polycrystalline film scratched off from the substrate  Several hundreds of nanometer sized grains and their boundaries are clearly visible from the image  and from which one of the grains is magnified in Fig  3c  The region ( 1 ) in Fig  3c  which is the grain interior  was magnified and analyzed using Fast Fourier transform ( FFT ) in Fig  3d  in which an inter-planar spacing of 32 Å is well-matched with the ( 002 ) reflection of cubic FAPbI3 ( Supplementary Table 3 )  At region ( 2 )  which is grain boundary  the FFT analysis revealed an inter-planar distance of 80 Å ( Fig  3e )  correlating to a characteristic ( 002 ) reflection of 2D PEA2PbI4 ( Supplementary Fig  23 and Supplementary Table 4 )  This supports the presence of 2D PVSK at grain boundaries  which was further confirmed by elemental distribution ( EDS ) analysis ( Supplementary Fig  24 )  At grain boundary regions  relatively larger amounts of carbon and nitrogen were detected  which could be due to presence of phenylethylammonium cation in the 2D PVSK  Band structure and electrical properties A schematic in Fig  4a shows 2D PVSK formation at the grain boundaries of the 3D PVSK film  Since the 2D PEA2PbI4 PVSK with aromatic rings and longer alkyl chains is expected to be more resistant to moisture  it protects the defective grain boundaries of 3D PVSK  resulting in significantly enhanced moisture stability of the film  Regardless of the improved stability  however  one can expect degraded electronic properties of the film due to the poor charge carrier mobility of the 2D PVSK  We investigated the band structure of FA098Cs002PbI3 ( with 167 mol % of 2D PVSK ) and PEA2PbI4 PVSK  which is illustrated in Fig  4b  The valence band maximum was measured using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy ( UPS  Supplementary Fig  25 )  while the Eg was determined from Tauc plots ( Supplementary Fig  26 )  As seen in Fig  4b  FA098Cs002PbI3 and PEA2PbI4 PVSK shows type I band alignment  Such band alignment resembles the alignment between PVSK and PbI2 formed at grain boundaries  which was found to reduce charge recombination and assist in charge separation/collection4041  Thus  analogous advantages of 2D PVSK at grain boundaries can be expected  Conductive atomic force microscopy ( c-AFM ) was performed in Fig  4c–f to see spatially resolved electrical properties of the films  Under ambient light conditions ( Fig  4c  d )  current flow in the PVSK film with 2D PVSK was higher at/near the grain boundaries while relatively uniform current flow was observed in the bare FAPbI3 film  With light illumination ( Fig  4e  f )  the current flow was further enhanced at/near the grain boundaries with 2D PVSK whereas current flow in bare FAPbI3 film was uniformly increased  which indicates charge separation and collection of photo-generated electrons is facilitated more so at grain boundaries with 2D PVSK  As suggested for PbI2  thin 2D PVSK regions at grain boundaries might suffer downward band bending under illumination ( dashed line in Fig  4b ) where photo-generated electrons are transferred from grain interiors  Due to the high-potential barrier to the holes  charge recombination will be reduced  which might be the origin of the superior PL lifetime and photovoltaic performance with 2D PVSK  Fig  4 figure 4 Band alignment and local conductivity with 2D perovskite  a Schematics of the device incorporating polycrystalline 3D perovskite film with 2D

Full size image Ambient and operational stability Finally  the stability of the control and target devices was compared  Figure 5a demonstrates the changes in PCE of the unencapsulated devices stored in a desiccator ( relative humidity lower than 30 %  evolution of an individual photovoltaic parameter can be found in Supplementary Fig  27 )  While the control device degraded by 29 % for 1392 h  the target device maintained 98 % of its initial efficiency during this time  The operational stability of the devices was also compared by maximum power point ( MPP ) tracking under 1 sun illumination in Fig  5b  Without encapsulation  the PCE of the control device rapidly degraded by 68 % during 450 min whereas that of target device was relatively less ( 20 % ) during the time  We performed 500 h of light exposure test with the encapsulated control ( bare FAPbI3 device ) and target devices ( w/ 167 mol % 2D PVSK )  The encapsulated devices were exposed to ca  09 sun ( 90 ± 5 mW cm−2 ) under open-circuit condition  of which the steady-state PCE was periodically measured for different exposure time  As seen in Fig  5c  both of the devices showed a rapid initial decay in PCE followed by slower decay with an almost linear profile  which is in agreement with previous reports42  After 500 h of exposure  the control device degraded to ca  523 % of its initial PCE whereas the target device maintained 723 % of the initial PCE  indicating enhanced stability with addition of 2D PVSK  We could extract tentative T80 ( time at which PCE of the device decays to 80 % of initial PCE ) for the devices by fitting of the post-burn-in region in which the PCE of the device shows an almost linear decay profile ( after 48 h )  The T80 for control and target devices were calculated to be 592 h and 1362 h  respectively  This indicates the stability of the device was significantly improved with addition of 2D PVSK  We also performed MPP tracking of the encapsulated target device under 1 sun ( 100 mW cm−2 ) illumination in Supplementary Fig  28  A total of 187 % of initial PCE was degraded for 130 h of operation  which is relatively slower compared to the device maintained at open-circuit condition  This is correlated with previous studies that attributed the faster degradation under open-circuit condition to larger number of photo-generated charge carriers recombining within the device43  Under operational condition with abundant photo-generated charges and built-in electric field  the major factors causing the degradation of the devices might be the highly mobile and reactive charged defects ( ions ) and/or trapped charge carriers associated with it4244  We suppose that migration of the charged defects or ions is possibly suppressed by 2D PVSK at grain boundaries  The temperature-dependent conductivity ( σ ) measurement of the lateral devices was performed to evaluate the activation energy for the ion migration ( Fig  6 )  The activation energy ( Ea ) for the migration can be determined according to the Nernst-Einstein relation42  where k is Boltzmann constant  σ0 is a constant  Inset of Fig  6a describes the structure of the lateral devices  With bare FAPbI3 PVSK  exponential enhancement in conductivity was clearly identified at around 130 K ( Fig  6a )  which is attributed to contribution of ions  The Ea for bare FAPbI3 film was calculated to be 016 eV  indicating significant contribution of activated ions at room temperature  which might cause degradation of the material and device under operational condition with built-in electric field  The pronounced current–voltage hysteresis behavior was observed even at very low temperature ( 180 K  Fig  6c )  In case of the PVSK film with 2D PVSK  the film did not show noticeable enhancement in conductivity with increased temperature ; although  the overall conductivity was relativity lower than the bare FAPbI3 film ( Fig  6c )  Even with moderate light illumination  it does not show the indicative of activated ions  As a result  the current–voltage curve did not show any hysteresis behavior ( Fig  6d )  As the grain boundaries of 3D perovskite were reported to be a major pathway for the migration of ions39  passivating the grain boundaries by incorporation of the ion-migration-immune 2D PVSK likely suppressed overall ion migration in the target device45  In addition  the improved phase purity of the film might also partially contribute to the suppressed ion migration because the secondary phase can generate defect sites that can act as an additional pathway for ion migration  We believe the suppressed ion migration contributes to enhanced operational stability of the target device  Fig  5 figure 5 Improved stability with 2D perovskite  a Evolution of power

way to fabricate phase-pure formamidinium tri-iodide PVSK with high-optoelectronic quality and stability by incorporating 2D PVSK  The large phenylethylammonium molecules from 2D PVSK precursors interact with FAPbI3 crystals to facilitate formation of the cubic PVSK phase during crystallization  which subsequently functionalize the grain boundaries after completion of the crystallization  The resulting phase-pure PVSK film has an identical Eg ( 148 eV ) to that of pure FAPbI3 with an order of magnitude enhanced PL lifetime  Average PCE of 2005 ± 045 % over 74 devices and the highest stabilized PCE of 2064 % ( certified stabilized PCE of 1977 % ) was achieved  Regardless of its low Eg  the PVSK solar cell showed the peak VOC of 1130 V  corresponding to the lowest loss-in-potential of 035 V among all the reported PVSK solar cells  Owed to the functionalized grain boundaries by the 2D PVSK  the phase stability of the film under high RH significantly improved and migration of ions ( or charged defects ) was suppressed  resulting in significantly improved ambient and operational stability of the device  We believe our approach to utilize spontaneously formed grain boundary 2D PVSK will provide important insights for the research community to design PVSK materials to achieve record PCEs accompanied by high stability and longevity  Methods Synthesis of phenylethylammonium iodide In a typical synthesis  48 g of phenethylamine ( 396 mmol  Aldrich  > 99 % ) was dissolved in 15 mL of ethanol and placed in iced bath  Under vigorous stirring  108 g of hydroiodic acid ( 57 wt % in H2O  481 mmol  Sigma-Aldrich  9999 %  contains no stabilizer ) was slowly added to the solution  The solution was stirred overnight to ensure complete reaction  which was followed by removal of the solvent by a rotary evaporator  The resulting solid was washed with diethyl ether several times until the color is changed to white  The white solid was further purified by recrystallization in mixed solvent of methanol and diethyl ether  Finally  white plate-like solid was filtered and dried under vacuum ( yield around 90 % )  Device fabrication Indium doped tin oxide ( ITO ) glass was cleaned with successive sonication in detergent  deionized ( DI ) water  acetone and 2-propanol for 15 min  respectively  The cleaned substrates were further treated with UV-ozone to remove the organic residual and enhance the wettability  A total of 30 mM SnCl2∙2H2O ( Aldrich  > 99995 % ) solution was prepared in ethanol ( anhydrous  Decon Laboratories Inc )  which was filtered by 02 μm syringe filter before use  To form a SnO2 layer  the solution was spin-coated on the cleaned substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s  which was heat-treated at 150 °C for 30 min  After cooling down to room temperature  the spin-coating process was repeated one more time  which was followed by annealing at 150 °C for 5 min and 180 °C for 1 h The SnO2 coated ITO glass was further treated with UV-ozone before spin-coating of PVSK solution  The PVSK layer was prepared by the modified adduct method26  The bare FAPbI3 layer was formed from the PVSK solution containing equimolar amount of HC ( NH2 ) 2I

20 s where 015 mL of diethyl ether ( anhydrous  > 990 %  contains BHT as stabilizer  Sigma-Aldrich ) was dropped after 10 s on the spinning substrate  The resulting transparent adduct film was heat-treated at 100 °C for 1 min followed by 150 °C for 10 min  ( for the best performing target device  the annealing condition was adjusted to 80 °C 1 min followed by 150 °C for 20 min ) The spiro-MeOTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 858 mg of spiro-MeOTAD ( Lumtec ) in 1 mL of chlorobenzene ( anhydrous  998 %  Sigma-Aldrich ) which was doped by 338 μl of 4-tert-butylpyridine ( 96 %  Aldrich ) and 193 μl of Li-TFSI ( 9995 %  Aldrich  520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile ) solution  The spiro-MeOTAD solution was spin-coated on the PVSK layer at 3000 rpm for 20 s by dropping 17 μl of the solution on the spinning substrate  On top of the spiro-MeOTAD layer  ca  100 nm-thick silver or gold layer was thermally evaporated at 05 Ås−1 to be used as an electrode  Material characterization

atmosphere  The one sun illumination was generated from Oriel Sol3A with class AAA solar simulator ( Newport )  in which light intensity was calibrated by NREL-certified Si photodiode equipped with KG-5 filter  Typically  the J–V curves were recorded at 01 Vs−1 ( between 12 V and −01 V with 65 data points and 02 s of delay time per point )  During the measurement  the device was covered with

common accessory mineral in a variety of mafic and ultramafic rocks  but perovskite deposits are rare and studies of perovskite ore deposits are correspondingly scarce  Perovskite is a key rock-forming mineral and reaches exceptionally high concentrations in olivinites  diverse clinopyroxenites and silicocarbonatites in the Afrikanda alkaline–ultramafic complex ( Kola Peninsula  NW Russia )  Across these lithologies  we classify perovskite into three types ( T1–T3 ) based on crystal morphology  inclusion abundance  composition  and zonation  Perovskite in olivinites and some clinopyroxenites is represented by fine-grained  equigranular  monomineralic clusters and networks ( T1 )  In contrast  perovskite in other clinopyroxenites and some silicocarbonatites has fine- to coarse-grained interlocked ( T2 ) and massive ( T3 ) textures  Electron backscatter diffraction reveals that some T1 and T2 perovskite grains in the olivinites and clinopyroxenites are composed of multiple subgrains and may represent stages of crystal rotation  coalescence and amalgamation  We propose that in the olivinites and clinopyroxenites  these processes result in the transformation of clusters and networks of fine-grained perovskite crystals ( T1 ) to mosaics of more coarse-grained ( T2 ) and massive perovskite ( T3 )  This interpretation suggests that sub-solidus processes can lead to the development of coarse-grained and massive perovskite  A combination of characteristic features identified in the Afrikanda perovskite ( equigranular crystal mosaics  interlocked irregular-shaped grains  and massive zones ) is observed in other oxide ore deposits  particularly in layered intrusions of chromitites and intrusion-hosted magnetite deposits and suggests that the same amalgamation processes may be responsible for some of the coarse-grained and massive textures observed in oxide deposits worldwide  Similar content being viewed by others Polymineralic inclusions

sk ore Field Article 01 December 2021 Introduction Oxide deposits formed by a range of magmatic  metamorphic and sedimentary processes ( Borrok et al  1998 ; Force 1991 ; Hou et al  2017 ; Irvine 1977 ; Latypov et al  2017 ) are important sources of economically critical elements  like Cr  Fe  V  Ti and platinum group metals  Perovskite ( CaTiO3 ) is not currently mined but could be a significant future titanium resource  This mineral is a typical accessory phase in a range of ultramafic and silica-undersaturated alkaline rocks  such as kimberlites  melilitolites  foidolites and carbonatites ( Campbell et al  1997 ; Chakhmouradian and Mitchell 1997 ; Nielsen 1980 )  In rare cases  perovskite is an abundant rock constituent  such as bebedourites in the Salitre alkaline complex  Brazil ( Barbosa et al  2012 )  dunites in the Gardiner carbonatite complex  Greenland ( Campbell et al  1997 ; Nielsen et al  1997 )  and Benfontein kimberlite sills in South Africa ( Dawson and Hawthorn 1973 )  However  perovskite deposits of significant tonnage and grade are exceptionally rare ; the few examples  where the economic potential of the perovskite mineralisation has been explored are structurally and texturally complex alkaline–ultramafic intrusions at Afrikanda in northwestern Russia ( Herz 1976 )  Tapira in southeastern Brazil ( Brod 1999 )  and Powderhorn in Colorado  USA ( Armbrustmacher 1981 )  It remains uncertain how the perovskite accumulated to ore-grade levels in these settings  Scarcity of perovskite ore deposits has not entailed many genetic studies  Several scenarios have been proposed to account for perovskite-rich zones  the most common involves magmatic layering due to gravitational settling ( Brod 1999 ; Dawson and Hawthorn 1973 )  On the other hand  perovskite-rich segregations show textural similarities to other oxide deposits  so genetic models for oxide ores may be pertinent to the genesis of perovskite accumulations  Relevant models include in situ crystallisation ( Charlier et al  2006 ; Latypov et al  2013 ; Pang et al  2007 ; Vukmanovic et al  2013 )  magma mixing ( Eales et al  1990 ; Irvine 1977 ; Kinnaird et al  2002 )  liquid immiscibility ( Kolker 1982 ; Lister 1966 ; McDonald 1965 ; Zhou et al  2005 )  mobilization of cumulate suspension from staging magma reservoirs ( Eales and Costin 2012 ; Mondal and Mathez 2006 )  and a range of postmagmatic ore-forming processes  including post-cumulus growth ( Vidyashankar and Govindaiah 2009 ; Yudovskaya and Kinnaird 2010 ) and deposition from hydrothermal fluids ( Cawthorn 2011 ; Harlov et al  2016 ; Knipping et al  2015 ; Pushkarev et al  2015 )  The current array of contrasting genetic models for the formation of oxide deposits suggests that sources of metals and mechanisms of their accumulation are not exclusive and should not be pigeonholed  Our study of perovskite from the Afrikanda alkaline–ultramafic complex targets the understanding of mechanisms responsible for the development of related massive ore textures  We describe the mineral assemblages and textures of the main Afrikanda lithologies and define three key perovskite textural types and associated chemical trends  We discuss the stages of perovskite textural development in the ultramafic rocks at Afrikanda  and the possibility of similar processes operating in other oxide deposits worldwide  Geological background The Afrikanda alkaline–ultramafic complex is one of the smallest intrusions in the Devonian ( ~ 380 Ma ) Kola Alkaline Province that hosts more than twenty plutonic and subvolcanic bodies  including alkaline  ultramafic  carbonatite  and melilitolite suites ( Kukharenko et al  1965 )  The Afrikanda complex is a multiphase intrusion emplaced into Archaean gneisses of the Belomorian Mobile Belt during rifting of the Fennoscandian Shield ( Chakhmouradian and Zaitsev 1999 ; Kramm et al  1993 )  The complex has a ~ 115 km2 circular shape at the current level of erosion  identified with gravimetric data as a 5 km thick ellipsoidal composite body with a NW-dipping conduit ( Arzamastsev et al  2000 ; Chakhmouradian and Zaitsev 2004 )  The complex has a concentric internal structure ( Afanasyev 2011 ; Kukharenko et al  1965 ) and hosts texturally and modally diverse olivinites and clinopyroxenites  cross-cut by minor intrusions of carbonatitic and foidolitic rocks ( Chakhmouradian and Zaitsev 2004 )  The olivinites and minor melilite-bearing olivinites are found as xenoliths ( up to 7 m ) in the clinopyroxenites  implying that the former rocks represent the earliest intrusive phase at Afrikanda ( Chakhmouradian and Zaitsev 1999 )  The term “ olivinites ” is used to emphasize that magnetite and perovskite  not chromite  are the major opaque minerals and to maintain consistency with previously published work on Afrikanda and other complexes in the Kola Alkaline Province and petrogenetically similar igneous provinces elsewhere in Russia  Most of the intrusion is composed of texturally and compositionally diverse clinopyroxenites ( Chakhmouradian and Zaitsev 2004 )  These clinopyroxenites are coarse-grained in the centre and transition outwards from fine-grained to nepheline-bearing along the margins  before grading to melteigites  The perovskite ore and perovskite-bearing rocks are hosted in the coarse-grained clinopyroxenites  referred to in the Russian literature as “ ore pyroxenites ”  located in the central part of the complex  The ultramafic rocks often exhibit alternating oxide- and silicate-rich layers that are considered to represent igneous layering ( Chakhmouradian and Zaitsev 2004 )  The oxide layers are primarily composed of perovskite and titanomagnetite and are enriched in rare earth elements ( REE ) ( Chakhmouradian and Zaitsev 2004 ; Yudin and Zak 1971 )  A carbonatitic suite  also known as calcite–amphibole–clinopyroxene rocks  occurs in the central part of the complex as branching veins ( 2 cm to 2 m thick ) and seemingly irregular ( in outcrop ) bodies that cross-cut the ultramafic series ( Chakhmouradian and Zaitsev 1999 )  According to the field  geochemical and mineralogical evidence  carbonatitic rocks are distinct from the clinopyroxenites  despite the abundance of diopside and perovskite in both  The carbonatitic rocks are mostly massive and coarse-grained to pegmatitic with modal proportions that change considerably over a short distance  producing a succession from silicocarbonatites to calcite carbonatites ( Chakhmouradian et al  2008 ; Chakhmouradian and Zaitsev 2004 ; Pekov et al  1997 )  The silicocarbonatites show a widespread mineralogical variability on a small spatial scale ( Chakhmouradian et al  2008 ; Chakhmouradian and Zaitsev 1999  2002  2004 ; Zaitsev and Chakhmouradian 2002 )  Alkaline feldspathoidal rocks appear to be the last intrusive phase and are principally represented by the melteigite–urtite series  The bulk of these rocks is associated with the nepheline-bearing clinopyroxenites in the eastern part of the complex  but pegmatoid ijolites comprising major nepheline  magnetite  perovskite and  locally  biotite also occur in the core as dikes cross-cutting the ultramafic and carbonatitic rocks ( Chakhmouradian and Zaitsev 1999 )  The Afrikanda perovskite-magnetite deposit is confined to the central part of the complex  dominated by coarse-grained clinopyroxenites ( > 50 % ) that host blocks of olivinites and are cross-cut by carbonatitic and feldspathoidal rocks  The ore comprises 15–35 vol % Ti-rich magnetite and 10–36 vol % perovskite  and shows wide variations in the abundance of silicate minerals and calcite  reflecting extreme petrographic heterogeneity of this deposit  The measured reserves  delineated to a depth of 300 m  include 343 Mt of ore averaging 125 wt % Fe and 83 wt % TiO2 ( Afanasyev 2011 )  Methodology All instruments used for the characterisation of samples are housed at the University of Tasmania  Australia  Polished samples were analysed by backscattered electron ( BSE ) imaging  energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry ( EDS ) and electron backscatter diffraction ( EBSD ) using a Hitachi SU-70 field emission scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) in the Central Science Laboratory  The SEM is fitted with an Oxford XMax80 EDS detector and an HKL Nordlys Nano EBSD camera  Major and trace element and U–Pb isotope analyses of perovskite and titanite were conducted using an Agilent 7900 quadrupole ICPMS  coupled to a Coherent COMPex Pro 193 nm ArF excimer laser system equipped with a Laurin Technic ( Resolution S155 ) constant geometry ablation cell at the School of Earth Sciences  Additional details are provided in the Appendix  Petrography of rock units Melilite-bearing olivinites Melilite-bearing olivinites are fine- to medium-grained  inequigranular rocks composed of forsterite ( 03–2 mm )  åkermanite ( 06–27 mm )  perovskite ( 50–550 µm ) and magnetite ( 02–15 mm )  and cut by calcite and wollastonite veinlets  Inclusions of euhedral perovskite ( 30–200 µm ) are also found in all other minerals  Perovskite grains are physically separated by serpentine  The preferential orientation of elongate forsterite and magnetite grains and ubiquitous serpentine in the same orientation defines a weak planar fabric in the rock  The interconnected networks and clusters of smaller euhedral perovskite grains enclose and distort the anhedral åkermanite  forsterite and magnetite grains generating intergrown  irregular and concave shapes ( Fig  1a )  Åkermanite is sodium-rich ( 2–3 wt % Na2O ) with thin rims of monticellite ( 11–12 wt % FeO ) surrounding some crystals  The forsterite crystals ( ~ Fo86−88 ) contain up to 1 wt % CaO and are partially replaced and cross-cut by serpentine with magnetite infill  Ferroan monticellite lamellae are observed within a few olivine grains ( Fig  2a )  Magnetite is compositionally homogeneous with high Ti  Mg and Al contents ( 4–7  1–2 and 1–2 wt % respective oxides )  Fig  1 figure 1 Backscattered electron ( BSE ) images of characteristic textures and mineralogy of the three main Afrikanda rock types  a Olivinites composed of

inequigranular rocks mainly composed of clinopyroxene  perovskite and magnetite with minor calcite  richterite  phlogopite  magnesiohastingsite  titanite  chlorite and various REE minerals ( Fig  1b )  Diopside ( 02 to 1 mm ) is zoned with titanomagnetite and magnesiohastingsite lamellae ( Fig  2b ) and inclusions of calcite  phlogopite and titanite  Diopside is partially replaced by magnesiohastingsite  biotite and clinochlore  Perovskite shows a range in grain sizes ( 005 to more than 2 mm )  shapes ( rounded to irregular ) and zonation ( homogeneous to complexly zoned )  and varies from chains of euhedral crystals to large areas of interlocking grains  Magnetite grains are rounded ( 03 to 13 mm  with rare grains up to 10 mm ) and contain variable Ti  Mg and Al contents ( < 4  3 and 2 wt % respective oxides )  Magnetite also contains lamellae of Mg-rich ilmenite ( Fig  2c )  trellis-like and irregular patches of ferroan spinel ( < 25 µm ) and Mn- and Mg-rich ilmenite ( < 50 µm )  The Mg-rich ilmenite lamellae contain small crystals of ferroan Ti-rich spinel ( 1 to 3 µm ) and baddeleyite ( < 1 µm ) ( Fig  2d )  REE phases are observed as inclusions in other minerals  with ancylite- ( Ce ) in richterite  cerite- ( Ce ) in calcite  and ancylite- ( Ce )  cerite- ( Ce ) and loparite- ( Ce ) in titanite  Silicocarbonatites The examined silicocarbonatite samples are extremely inequigranular ( fine- to coarse-grained ) and predominantly composed of calcite  diopside  perovskite  magnetite  magnesiohastingsite and titanite  In perovskite-rich areas  calcite occurs as veinlets ( up to 5 mm in width )  euhedral crystals ( 03 to > 4 mm across ) and interstitial to perovskite ( 03 to 2 mm )  and is the most abundant mineral in the samples ( up to 50 vol % )  Titanite and cerite ( less common ) are observed at the peripheral areas of the calcite veinlets  Titanite is the most abundant interstitial mineral  with REE minerals such as cerite- ( Ce )  loparite- ( Ce ) and ancylite- ( Ce ) found enclosed in the titanite  Magnetite has low Ti  Mg and Al contents ( less than 1 wt %  respectively ) and contains lamellae of Mn- and Mg-rich ilmenite and irregular grains of Zn- and Fe-rich spinel  Perovskite shows a range of grain sizes ( 005 to more than 2 mm )  shapes ( rounded to irregular )  and zonation ( homogeneous to complexly zoned )  and varies from small interlocking grains to large areas of massive perovskite ( Fig  1c )  Perovskite also occurs as clusters with accessory titanite  calcite  loparite- ( Ce ) and rare fluorapatite  For more detailed descriptions of the mineralogy and textures of silicocarbonatites  the reader is referred to publications by Chakhmouradian and Zaitsev ( 1999  2002  2004 ) and Zaitsev and Chakhmouradian ( 2002 )  Perovskite textures Three distinct perovskite textures are identified in the three main rock types at Afrikanda  These types are defined by their morphology  composition  zoning patterns and abundance of multiphase inclusions ( Fig  3a–f )  Fig  3 figure 3 Representative BSE images of the various perovskite textures  a T1 in olivinites  b T1 in clinopyroxenite  c T2 in clinopyroxenite  d T2 in silicocarbonatite  e T3 in clinopyroxenite  f T3 in silicocarbonatite  Cal calcite  Di diopside  Lpr loparite  Mt magnetite  Ol olivine  Srp serpentine  REE-prv REE-perovskite  Ttn titanite Full size image Type one ( T1 ) perovskite is observed in the olivinites and clinopyroxenites  characterised by interconnected polygonal crystal clusters and networks  The euhedral pseudo-octahedral perovskite grains ( 50–550 µm ) have straight boundaries with widespread 120° triple-junctions ( Fig  3a )  Multiphase inclusions are abundant in grain cores  The number of inclusions is dependent on grain size  with a general trend of more inclusions with increasing grain size  Most of the perovskite grains exhibit no detectable zoning in BSE images  while a small number of grains along the zone of contact with magnetite grains have a lower-AZ rim ( AZ = average atomic number )  Perovskite T1 in the clinopyroxenites has a greater number of grains with a low-AZ rim along their contact with both adjacent perovskite and magnetite grains  The perovskite grains neighboured by magnetite can also exhibit oscillatory zoning with multiple narrow bands along the grain boundaries ( Fig  3b )  The grain boundaries between perovskite are straight  whereas boundaries with other minerals are curvilinear  The perovskite grain boundaries in the melilite olivinites and clinopyroxenites are clearly visible  however  EBSD revealed that some of these grains are a composite of several subgrains  each with slight deviations in crystal orientation ( Fig  4aiii  biii )  Type two ( T2 ) perovskite in the clinopyroxenites is represented by an intricate mosaic of interlocking anhedral grains ( 01 to 1 mm ; Figs  1b  3c ) and in the silicocarbonatites  by rounded grains ( 02 to > 2 mm ) surrounded by interstitial material ( Figs  1c  3d )  Triple junctions are observed between adjacent perovskite grains in the clinopyroxenites  at approximately 120°  Multiphase and monomineralic inclusions of phlogopite  magnetite  loparite- ( Ce )  calcite  titanite and fluorapatite vary from rare to abundant among the examined samples  Perovskite in the silicocarbonatites contains a greater proportion of monomineralic inclusions and fewer multiphase inclusions than that in the clinopyroxenites  Zoning is prominent in all perovskite grains and can be highly complex in some areas or individual grains  Large grains commonly display less compositional complexity than the smaller grains  The zoning in the core is challenging to decipher due to compositional changes occurring along the grain boundaries and fractures ( Figs  3d  5a )  In BSE images  most grains have a darker core and comparatively lighter rim caused by differences in concentration of Na  light rare earth elements ( LREE )  and Nb ( Fig  5d )  The changes in composition at the rims are not systematic  often showing irregular  embayed patterns ( Fig  5a )  In some samples  perovskite has darker rim in areas where perovskite is in direct contact with magnetite or calcite ( Fig  5c )  Fig  4 figure 4 Structural analysis and crystallographic orientation of perovskite grains in the different textures  a T1 in olivinites  b T1 in clinopyroxenite  c T2 in clinopyroxenite  d T2 in silicocarbonatite  e T2 ( right ) and T3 ( left ) in silicocarbonatite  f T3 in clinopyroxenite  i BSE

in their high AZ  are referred to here as REE-perovskite  The mineral ranges in size from 20 µm to 15 mm and can exhibit irregular zoning due to differences in Na  LREE and Nb contents ( Fig  3d )  The REE-perovskite forms irregular  cuspate shapes as halos around loparite- ( Ce ) in perovskite and at perovskite rims that are commonly in contact with interstitial loparite- ( Ce ) and titanite ( Fig  2e )  Type 2 perovskite coexists with titanite  calcite and loparite- ( Ce ) ; rare fluorapatite was also found in the silicocarbonatites  Titanite is zoned and forms irregular wedge-shaped crystals between perovskite  thin rims around perovskite and intergrown with interstitial ilmenite ( 02-1 mm )  REE-perovskite and loparite- ( Ce ) associated with T2 perovskite are more abundant in the silicocarbonatites  which also contain a larger proportion of interstitial minerals  Perovskite grain boundaries can be difficult to distinguish in BSE images  especially in the silicocarbonatites  however  in the Euler images the boundaries are clearly visible ( Fig  4cii  dii )  The Euler patterns also show that in the clinopyroxenites  most large irregularly shaped grains have only one crystallographic orientation  while the smaller more-rounded grains still have differences in orientation that indicate the presence of subgrains ( Fig  4ciii )  The irregular grain boundaries of large perovskite crystals suggest they developed from multiple smaller grains ( Fig  4cii )  In the silicocarbonatites  the small and large perovskite grains have only one orientation ( Fig  4diii )  Type 3 ( T3 ) in the clinopyroxenites and silicocarbonatites is represented by massive perovskite with patches of irregular zoning and rare multiphase inclusions  The intensity of the zoning varies across the samples  some areas are almost homogeneous and others exhibit complex patterns due to extreme variations in Na  LREE and Nb contents ( Fig  4b )  Chakhmouradian and Zaitsev ( 1999 ) also reported small-scale order-of-magnitude variations in Th in REE-perovskite and loparite- ( Ce ) mantling T3  These authors also described oscillatory growth patterns truncated by Na-REE ( ± Nb  Th ) -rich areas in euhedral cubo-octahedral crystals  Mineral inclusions of titanite  calcite  loparite- ( Ce ) and cerite are dispersed throughout massive perovskite and between perovskite grains  Generally  areas of perovskite with interstitial minerals contain fewer mineral inclusions  and vice versa  Interstitial titanite can be intergrown with ilmenite and form large patches up to 1 mm containing scattered ilmenite and perovskite  Symplectite-like intergrowths of titanite  rutile and ilmenite ( 200–500 µm ) are typical in some silicocarbonatites ( Fig  2f )  Type 3 perovskite lacks easily distinguishable grain boundaries  The Euler images show that perovskite is massive  with the same crystallographic orientation for large areas of perovskite ( Fig  4eii  fii )  Multiphase inclusions in perovskite The perovskite-hosted multiphase inclusions in the three rock types show rounded  elongated and irregular shapes  and range from < 5 to 50 µm across  The inclusions are all identified as primary based on their random/unsystematic distribution within the grains and the lack of association with secondary features  such as healed fractures  The inclusions typically contain three to ten mineral phases and include anhydrous and water-bearing silicates  carbonates  oxides  sulphides and phosphates  The abundance of multiphase inclusions and their mineralogical complexity decrease from the olivinites to clinopyroxenites and then silicocarbonatites  A detailed analysis and discussion on these multiphase inclusions will be presented in a subsequent publication  Perovskite compositions The textural types of perovskite in the three rock types vary in major and trace element compositions  The substituent elements show a negative correlation with Ca and Ti and a positive correlation with each other ( Fig  6a–d )  Type 1 perovskite has the lowest abundances of substituent elements and a limited range of compositions  notably up to 2 wt % REE and less than 1 wt % Fe ( Fig  6d )  The range in element concentrations is greater in T2 and T3 perovskite due to their complex zoning patterns  with the most compositional scatter observed in T2 perovskite from the silicocarbonatites and T3 perovskite from the clinopyroxenites ( Fig  6 )  Type 2 perovskite contains 1–7 wt % REE and up to 15 wt % Nb and Fe  while T3 perovskite has 4–7 wt % REE  1–2 wt % Nb  and up to 15 wt % Na and Fe  Fig  6 figure 6 Bivariate plots of LA-ICPMS major- and trace-element chemistry of the perovskites  Symbols correspond to the four perovskite textures found in the Afrikanda

lanthanides decreasing with increasing atomic number [ La > Nd > Pr > Sm ; ( La/Yb ) CN = 140–2300 ]  Chondrite-normalised REE patterns for all textural types exhibit a negative slope ( Fig  7 )  Overall  the chondrite profiles show a relative enrichment in all REE from T1 to T3  with a greater increase in light REE for T2 and T3 compared to T1  The complete set of LA-ICPMS data is presented

isotopic measurements were obtained for perovskite from the olivinites  45 from the clinopyroxenites and 124 from the silicocarbonatites  All but one analysis were used in age calculations  Perovskite contains abundant common Pb and so concordia intercept ages using the Tera–Wasserburg plot are reported  The Pb isotope composition of calcite was analysed and used as a common-Pb anchor for the concordia intercept ages because this mineral has high Pb/U ratios  The measured 207Pb/206Pb value of calcite is 08277 ± 00039 and  thus  differs from the two-stage Pb evolution model of Stacey and Kramers ( 1975 ) for 380 Ma  Perovskite from all lithologies gives a concordia intercept age of 3683 ± 12 +/- 748 Ma ( including systematic uncertainties ) with an MSWD of 080 and a probability-of-fit of 098 ( Fig  8a )  Perovskite ages for each of the analysed lithologies are reported in Table 1  Fig  8 figure 8 Tera–Wasserburg concordia plot for a perovskite and b titanite analyses  Symbols : a

Fig  8b )  The complete set of U–Pb geochronology results is presented in the Appendix  Discussion Age of the Afrikanda complex The Palaeozoic igneous complexes in the Kola Alkaline Province were emplaced during a relatively short time during the Late Devonian ( 380−360 Ma ) with no reliably post-Devonian magmatic events recorded to date ( Arzamastsev et al  2000 )  The Afrikanda complex was emplaced at ~ 380 Ma with other alkaline–ultramafic complexes  including Kovdor  Turiy Mys  Lesnaya Varaka and Ozernaya Varaka ( Arzamastsev and Wu 2014 )  Our geochronological study of perovskite from the melilite olivinites  clinopyroxenites and silicocarbonatites yielded similar ages of 3704 ± 54  3689 ± 29  3681 ± 13  respectively ( Table 1 )  Our average perovskite age of 3683 ± 12 Ma ( Fig  8a ) is in good agreement with most of the previously published U–Pb ages for this intrusion ( Fig  9 )  including : 364 ± 3 Ma and 374 ± 10 for perovskite from clinopyroxenite ( Kramm et al  1993 ; Reguir et al  2010 )  371 ± 8 Ma for perovskite from silicocarbonatite ( Reguir et al  2010 )  and 377 ± 3 Ma for schorlomite from silicocarbonatite ( Salnikova et al  2018 )  Somewhat older ages were reported by Wu et al  ( 2010  2013 ) for perovskite from clinopyroxenite  calcite-bearing perovskite ore and ijolite–melteigite ( 376–385 Ma  averaging 381 ± 2 Ma )  and for calzirtite and zirconolite from clinopyroxenites ( Wu et al  2010 )  Several factors could be responsible for the slight age discrepancies between our data and the data of Wu et al  ( 2010  2013 )  including the choice of U–Pb calibration material  susceptibility of some analytical techniques to matrix effects  and the choice of a common-Pb anchor  Our study supports the contemporaneous emplacement of the various rock types ( olivinites  clinopyroxenites and silicocarbonatites ) in the Afrikanda complex  as indicated by the identical ages of the perovskite from the different lithologies ( Fig  9 )  Evidence for the relatively rapid emplacement of the Afrikanda deposit comes primarily from the homogeneity of the perovskite U–Pb ages ( MSWD of 080 for all perovskite analyses )  at least at the precision attainable with the LA-ICPMS system used  Additionally  our study presents new insights into the common-Pb isotopic composition of the Afrikanda perovskite and shows that the initial Pb isotopic composition of its parental magma is significantly more radiogenic than predicted by the two-stage model of Stacey and Kramers ( 1975 )  Fig  9 figure 9 Age summary of the alkaline ultramafic

Salnikova et al  ( 2018 ) Full size image U–Pb age data have not been previously reported for titanite from the Afrikanda complex  Significant scatter in the U–Pb system for titanite is a result of either Pb movement within the titanite structure after crystallisation  or the incorporation of radiogenic and common Pb  Lead loss or partial re-setting of the U–Pb system during later re-crystallisation events could also be responsible for some of the scatter ( Fig  8b )  Using data whose concordance is better than 50 %  an age of 3742 ± 53 Ma was calculated and is consistent with the perovskite results discussed above ( Table 1 )  However  a range of younger titanite ages that are more discordant due to Pb loss suggest there may have been a re-setting or titanite crystallisation event  Development of perovskite textures The detailed textural and chemical examination of perovskite in the olivinites  clinopyroxenites and silicocarbonatites revealed three perovskite types distinguished by morphology  zonation  inclusion abundance and chemical composition  The olivinites host T1 perovskite ( Figs  1a  3a )  whereas the clinopyroxenites contain T1–3 perovskite ( Figs  1b  3b–d ) and similar T2 and T3 textures are observed in the silicocarbonatites  We have separated the geological interpretation of the ultramafic rocks ( discussed below ) from that of the silicocarbonatites  The focus here is primarily on the textural evolution of the olivinites and clinopyroxenites  because perovskite textures in the silicocarbonatites have been discussed previously by Chakhmouradian and Zaitsev ( 1999  2004 )  Olivinites and clinopyroxenites Textures of rocks are the sum of all processes involved from the initial formation through maturation  and can be used to understand the sequence and nature of each of the evolutionary stages  However  the process of textural equilibration can effectively obscure features related to earlier developmental phases  so we can only speculate from the existing textures about the nature of a rock prior to recrystallization ( Pike and Schwarzman 1977 )  In the case of the Afrikanda rocks  T1 perovskite forms chains and clusters and may suggest that at some point in the early history of the rock individual euhedral grains of perovskite were disseminated and then clumped together to form clusters and chains ( Figs  1a  3a  b )  However  we can not provide clues on the origin of these individual perovskite grains due to the subsequent overprinting events  Therefore  we focus here on development of the Afrikanda perovskite ore by reconstructing the later stages of mineral amalgamation and recrystallization  Textural equilibration The T1 perovskite aggregates consist of closely packed equigranular crystals with pseudo-octahedral shapes  forming straight boundaries that converge at ~ 120° triple junctions  This arrangement resembles granoblastic-polygonal textures ( Figs  3a  10a )  as observed in monomineralic cumulates  mantle-derived ultramafics and massive metamorphic rocks such as granofelses ( Fig  10a  b ) ( Higgins 2011 ; Holness et al  2005  2006 ; Hunter 1987 ; Kretz 1966 ; Wandji et al  2009 )  Therefore  we suggest the granoblastic-polygonal texture of T1 perovskite indicates that the host rocks have experienced dynamic textural equilibration  The granoblastic-polygonal texture of T1 perovskite in olivinites and clinopyroxenites differs marginally due to the variable abundance and distribution of the surrounding minerals  with perovskite in the olivinites clumped together forming aggregates  but dispersed in clinopyroxenites forming chains  Textural equilibration is a well-known phenomenon in natural systems ( eg  Higgins 2015  2017 ; Holness et al  2006 )  but the bulk of empirical data  computer simulations and models comes from materials research  especially alloys  ceramics and thin films ( eg  Holm et al  2016 )  Thus  our current understanding of textural equilibration is limited to relatively simple systems ( from a geologist ’ s standpoint ) that differ both chemically and mechanically from oxide-silicate assemblages described in the present work  Another challenge in adopting materials science theories to rocks is terminology ; for example  their use of the term “ recrystallization ” is essentially restricted to deformation-induced phenomena  whereas processes addressed in this paper would be described as “ grain growth due to annealing ” [ eg  Chap  11 in Humphreys and Hatherly ( 2004 ) ]  According to previously published experimental evidence  the degree and style of textural equilibration depend on many parameters  notably temperature  pressure  grain distribution  modal homogeneity of the precursor  high-temperature phase transitions  the presence of structural defects  and such kinetic factors as cooling rate ( Clark et al  1977 ; Humphreys and Hatherly 2004 ; Kreitcberg et al  2017 ; McCloy et al  2009 ; Syrenko and Klinishev 1973 )  Because we observe no evidence for postmagmatic metamorphism at Afrikanda  and the subsolidus mineral assemblages common in the silicocarbonatites record a temperature range of 200–400 °C ( Chakhmouradian and Williams 2004 ; Chakhmouradian and Zaitsev 2004 )  we assume the documented textural changes arose during cooling  The process involved grain boundary migration  boundary-angle adjustment  dislocation movement  loss of inclusions  and ultimately  coarsening of the grains to minimise their internal and surface energies ( Hunter 1987 )  We suggest that after perovskite accumulation  slow cooling of the ultramafic rocks enabled the transformation of many small  randomly oriented and possibly irregularly fitted perovskite grains into the observed polygonal mosaics ( Figs  1a  3a  10a )  Fig  10 figure 10 BSE images of granoblastic textures ( a–d ) SEM ( e  f ) Plane-polarized light  a Equigranular mosaic of T1 perovskite from olivinite in the

image Perovskite coalescence and coarsening Grain coalescence and coarsening are important processes in the late stages of textural equilibration ( Doherty et al  1997 ; Hunter 1987 )  In this section  we discuss grain growth during subsolidus evolution of the ultramafic rocks at Afrikanda as a continuation of the previously recognised textural equilibration  The development of larger grains can either occur by grain boundary migration  ie  through the dissolution of small crystals and simultaneous growth of larger crystals  or by grain coalescence  where adjacent grain boundaries are eliminated as similarly oriented crystals coalesce ( Higgins 2011 ; Li 1962 )  The application of EBSD in our study of perovskite enables us to identify and differentiate between these two types of grain growth ( Humphreys 2001 )  Some large grains in T1 and T2 perovskite are composed of subgrains with slightly different crystallographic orientations ( circled in Fig  4a–c )  These subgrains within larger perovskite grains suggest the dominant mechanism of grain growth was grain rotation and coalescence  Experimental evidence has shown that coalescence is favoured over grain boundary migration at lower temperatures ( Rios et al  2005 ; Sandström et al  1978 ; Varma and Willits 1984 ; Walter and Koch 1963 )  This further supports that the observed perovskite textures and their inferred transformation represent a postmagmatic environment  The process of grain coarsening occurs via diffusion of vacancies in the crystal lattice  in an effort to eliminate or homogenise high angle  irregular  and large area boundaries ( Li 1962 )  These disequilibrium features are removed as adjacent crystals adopt similar crystallographic orientations and grain boundaries are eliminated as similarly oriented grains coalesce into one larger crystal ; this process is exemplified by T1 and T2 perovskite ( circled in Fig  4a–c ) ( Jones et al  1979 ; Li 1962 ; Rios et al  2005 )  These larger grains can continue to grow at low-angle boundaries with neighbouring small grains ( Li 1962 )  Also during coalescence  the new grain boundaries straighten  removing 120° triple junctions by adjusting the dihedral angles of the adjacent grains  This process alters the morphology of the newly coalesced grain and neighbouring grains ( see Fig  4 in Rios et al  ( 2005 ) )  Triple junctions are typical in T1 perovskite  while less common triple junctions in T2 are no longer strictly at 120° due to the boundary migration associated with grain coalescence ( Fig  3c ; Vernon 1970 )  Type 2 perovskite shows the best examples of grain coalescence  with EBSD images capturing grain coalescence “ in progress ” ( like T1 ) and at completion  Larger T2 perovskite grains in the clinopyroxenites have some remaining triple junctions and are composed of multiple misoriented subgrains of similar sizes to T1 perovskite ( Fig  4ciii )  We suggest the large grains initially resembled T1 perovskite clusters prior to coalescence and have not completely adopted a uniform orientation  Further  we interpret the textural equilibration in the Afrikanda perovskite samples to indicate that coalescence and coarsening of small equilibrated polygonal clusters ( T1 ) enabled the development of a mosaic of larger T2 polycrystalline grains with interlocking grain boundaries and smaller areas of massive T3 perovskite  Effects of recrystallization The coarsening of accumulated perovskite during recrystallization in the Afrikanda complex is supported by the complex chemical zoning patterns in perovskite and exsolution lamellae in the associated minerals  Perovskite chemical zoning Perovskite-group minerals serve as sensitive indicators to changes in parental environments through complex substitutions of multiple elements in their structure ( Chakhmouradian et al  2013 ; Mitchell et al  2017 )  The variation in the composition and zoning of perovskite from T1 to T3 records the chemical evolution of its crystallisation environment under open- or closed-system conditions  Zoning patterns can be caused by chemical fluctuations in the parental medium  changes in the physical conditions during crystal growth  or solid-state redistribution of elements ( Dowty 1976a  b )  Perovskite in T1 is distinguished from T2 and T3 perovskite by the state of textural equilibration and significant differences in chemical composition  Importantly  T1 grains have no internal zoning  consistently low REE values and minor compositional variation localized to the rims of some grains in contact with magnetite ( Figs  3b  6a–d )  Perovskite in the clinopyroxenite shows far more compositional variation  with simple zoning along perovskite grain contacts and oscillatory patterns at the contacts adjacent to magnetite ( Fig  3b )  We interpret the internal compositional homogeneity to record textural equilibration of perovskite grains  and the minor zoning to arise from later metasomatic processes  In contrast  T2 and T3 perovskite are significantly more complex with non-systematic and discontinuous zoning ( Fig  5a  b )  Their composition is highly variable  particularly with respect to REE contents ( Fig  6d ) and is linked with the irregular and complex zoning patterns  Zoning in T2 and T3 perovskite could be associated with the development of local chemical gradients during grain coalescence  where the differential diffusion of cations creates compositional complexity and irregularity superposed over the existing grain morphology ( Fig  6d )  Perovskite in T3 is massive and most of T3 is relatively homogeneous  with some areas still displaying convoluted zoning with no clear pattern ( Fig  3e  f )  We suggest these homogeneous areas re-equilibrated through solid-state diffusion removing the complex zoning and physical impurities such as multiphase inclusions  Areas that are texturally heterogeneous underwent limited textural re-equilibration ; however  the zoning is still less complex or abundant than in T2 perovskite  Controls on perovskite compositions The composition of T1 perovskite is fairly homogeneous  while T2 and T3 vary significantly  reflecting changes in the availability of such elements as REE  Nb and Th ( Fig  6c  d )  In T2 perovskite  these elements are primarily concentrated at the rims and along the grain boundaries ( Fig  2e  5a  c  d )  This type of zoning can be produced by selective cation diffusion during re-equilibration of perovskite with a fluid phase  This process has been invoked to explain perovskite zoning in some kimberlites ( Chakhmouradian et al  2013 ) and loparite- ( Ce ) replacement by cation-deficient phases in some alkaline rocks ( Chakhmouradian et al  1999 )  We suggest the high-REE rims in the Afrikanda T2 perovskite are probably associated with the progressive infiltration of REE and other substituent elements into perovskite from a fluid percolating along grain boundaries and fractures ( Fig  2e )  The formation of T3 perovskite was a continuation from T2 polycrystalline grains  and resulted in higher levels of REE ( on average ) in T3 relative to T2 perovskite from the same rock type ( Fig  7 )  This enrichment in REE possibly required input of these elements from an external source ( eg  carbonatitic or alkaline magma ; Chakhmouradian and Mitchell 1997 )  We envisage that continuous flux of REE through the ultramafic intrusion under open-system conditions produced the compositional variations  The presence of REE-perovskite and loparite- ( Ce ) as discontinuous rims and overgrowths on T2 and T3 perovskite ( Figs  2e  5a  b ) is also undoubtedly linked to the infiltration of a REE-rich fluid in an open system  We agree with Chakhmouradian and Mitchell ( 1997 ) that these minerals developed due to infiltration of REE-rich CO2-rich fluid  which facilitated both fracturing and the uptake of REE ( ± Th ± Nb ) in the perovskite structure  The infiltration of REE into the crystal structure produces a diffuse marginal zone of REE-perovskite ( Fig  2e )  whose width is controlled by the kinetics of diffusion and the relative diffusivity of differently charged cations ( Chakhmouradian et al  2013 )  Similar perovskite–loparite- ( Ce ) reaction rims and mantles have been reported in other carbonatite complexes and  less commonly  in evolved kimberlites ( Chakhmouradian et al  1999 ; Chakhmouradian and Mitchell 1997  2000 )  Exsolution lamellae Exsolution lamellae are a common feature in minerals that have undergone re-equilibration to rid their crystal structure of impurities through solid-state diffusion ( Putnis 2009 )  Exsolution textures in the olivinites and clinopyroxenites include monticellite lamellae in forsterite ( Fig  2a )  magnetite and magnesiohastingsite lamellae in diopside ( Fig  2b )  and inclusions of spinel and ilmenite in Ti-rich magnetite ( Fig  2c  d )  Calcium is generally a minor constituent in forsterite  with concentrations lower than 1 wt % ( Jurewicz and Watson 1988 ; Simkin and Smith 1970 )  The rare occurrence of Ca-rich exsolution phases  such as diopside and monticellite-kirschsteinite  have been reported as a product of postmagmatic transformation of olivine in terrestrial rocks ( Gaeta 1996 ; Markl et al  2001 ; Xiong et al  2017 ; Yufeng et al  2008 ) and meteorites ( McKay et al  1998 ; Mikouchi et al  1995 )  We interpret the textures in the Afrikanda samples to have formed by exsolution of Fe-rich monticellite during postmagmatic equilibration of Ca-rich forsterite  Elongate lamellae of oxide phases in pyroxenes are observed in mafic igneous and metamorphic rocks ( Fleet et al  1980 ; Garrison and Taylor 1981 )  Based on petrographic evidence  we suggest that exsolution of Ti-rich magnetite and magnesiohastingsite from the diopside host at Afrikanda also occurred during subsolidus equilibration  Magnetite is observed in both rock types  but the composition and homogeneity ( ie  the nature and relative abundance of exsolution lamellae ) differs between the examined olivinite and clinopyroxenite samples  Exsolution textures in Ti-rich magnetite are common in mafic plutonic rocks and have been the subject of many researches ( Haggerty 1991 ; Price 1980 ; Ramdohr 2013 )  Exsolution textures reflect the chemical composition and cooling history of the precursor magnetite ( Buddington and Lindsley 1964 ; Howarth et al  2013 ; Von Gruenewaldt et al  1985 )  The magnetite in the olivinites has the highest concentrations of Ti  Mg and Al and does not exhibit any exsolution lamellae  Magnetite in the clinopyroxenite samples has much lower levels of these elements due to preferential partitioning of Ti and Mg into ilmenite  and Mg and Al into spinel inclusions ( Fig  2d )  The variation in magnetite texture between the two rock types supports the suggestion that they underwent different degrees of subsolidus re-equilibration  Perovskite textures in the silicocarbonatites Chemical composition and zoning Perovskite zoning in the silicocarbonatites is more complex than in the clinopyroxenites  The T2 perovskite has oscillatory zoning in the cores and irregular zoning at the rims ( Fig  5d ) and in T3 massive perovskite has areas with oscillatory or irregular zoning  as well as homogeneous areas  The oscillatory zoning in T2 and T3 perovskite is a primary magmatic feature  The irregular complex zoning juxtaposed over primary growth patterns in these perovskite varieties was caused by progressive infiltration of REE  Na and locally also Nb and Th into the structure during postmagmatic fluid-driven alteration ( Chakhmouradian and Zaitsev 1999 )  This process culminated with the deposition of REE-perovskite and loparite- ( Ce ) locally along the margin of  and fractures within  perovskite crystals ( Figs  3d  5c  d )  Titanite crystallised after these minerals  indicating either an increase in silica activity  or a decrease in fluid temperature ( Chakhmouradian 2004 )  The formation of symplectitic intergrowths of titanite with rutile and ilmenite ( Fig  2f ) implies increasing fluid acidity or  more likely  a further decrease in temperature  which would expand the stability fields of both rutile and ilmenite at a given pH  p ( CO2 ) and a ( Fe2+ ) ( Chakhmouradian 2004 ; Chakhmouradian and Mitchell 2002 )  Occasional grains of T2 perovskite rimmed by low-REE material are much less common and could be produced by the inverse process  ie  extraction of REEs from perovskite by percolating fluids ( Fig  5c )  The compositionally homogeneous sections in T3 perovskite probably re-equilibrated through solid-state diffusion  which erased such primary textural characteristics as growth zoning and multiphase inclusions  Textural development In the silicocarbonatites  we observe irregularly shaped crystals with continuous crystallographic orientation  similar to the clinopyroxenites ; however  the small perovskite grains also have a single crystallographic orientation and are not a composite of subgrains ( Fig  4diii )  The absence of EBSD evidence of subgrain coalescence and the preservation of oscillatory zoning in T2 and T3 perovskite suggests that the coarse-grained perovskite did not undergo the same coalescence and amalgamation processes as those observed in the ultramafic rocks  However  the similarities in chemical composition  zoning patterns and associated minerals [ eg  titanite  REE-perovskite and loparite- ( Ce ) ] indicate that the perovskite from both the ultramafic rocks and silicocarbonatites experienced the same fluid-driven alteration  We propose that the silicocarbonatites did not undergo perovskite recrystallization due to the lower solidus temperature of the silicocarbonatites compared to the ultramafic rocks  Also  the perovskite was initially fine-grained in the olivinites and clinopyroxenites but coarse-grained in the silicocarbonatites  so the difference in initial grain size may have impeded perovskite re-crystallisation in the silicocarbonatites  Textural similarities with other oxide deposits Several textural features that support the process of perovskite amalgamation and re-equilibration in the Afrikanda complex are observed in other oxide-rich igneous systems  namely chromite and magnetite deposits ( Charlier et al  2006 ; Dill 2010 ; Mungall 2014 )  as well as mantle-derived lherzolites and dunites ( Wandji et al  2009 )  apatite in carbonatites ( Chakhmouradian et al  2017 ; Kamenetsky et al  2015 )  recrystallized nepheline syenites ( Chakrabarty et al  2016 ; Ulbrich 1993 ) and magnesian-ilmenite xenolith/xenocrysts in kimberlites and basanites ( Mitchell 1973 ; Leblanc et al  1982 )  These features include granoblastic mosaics  massive textures  grain coarsening and the transition from inclusion-rich to inclusion-free grains ( Christiansen 1985 ; Ghisler 1976 ; Yudovskaya and Kinnaird 2010 )  Understanding the mechanisms responsible for the development of these features in disseminated and massive ore bodies within chromitite and magnetitite layers remains ambiguous  Granoblastic mosaics and massive textures For comparison  we have chosen typical examples of ophiolite dunites  podiform chromitites and ultramafic xenoliths  Chains of connected euhedral chromite crystals observed in ultramafic xenoliths  igneous complexes like Bushveld ( South Africa ) and Fiskenaesset ( Greenland ) and the Oman ophiolite resemble networks of T1 perovskite ( Fig  10e )  Granoblastic textures in peridotitic xenoliths from the subcontinental lithospheric mantle are highlighted by the equigranular  euhedral olivine with interspersed linear chromite chains ( Fig  10e  f )  The latter are similar to the T1 perovskite chains at Afrikanda ( Fig  10b )  The xenolith textures reflect metamorphic stresses that caused mineral grains to recrystallize into granoblastic mosaic textures with straight margins and 120° triple junctions ( Pike and Schwarzman 1977 )  At Bushveld and Fisknaesset  small chromite grains are generally euhedral to subhedral and form elongate chains  also reminiscent of T1 perovskite ( Ghisler 1970 ; Sampson 1932 ; Yudovskaya and Kinnaird 2010 )  Silicate mineral inclusions are common and mostly restricted to grain cores  Chromitites in the Oman ophiolite belt demonstrate an increasing grain size with deformation ( Christiansen 1986 )  Christiansen ( 1985 ) described three morphological types of chromite ( A  B and C ) that are comparable to the three textural types of perovskite ( T1  T2 and T3 )  respectively  in the present study  Type A consists of closely packed subhedral to euhedral chromite grains that mostly range between 05 and 1 mm across and regularly host silicate inclusions  Type B is closely packed  subhedral to anhedral chromite grains between 01 mm and 45 mm in size with occasional silicate inclusions  Type C is composed of massive  closely packed and interlocking anhedral chromite grains with indiscernible boundaries and an estimated size larger than A- and B-type grains  Christiansen ( 1985  1986 ) proposed that the coarsening of chromite occurred during recrystallization and was driven by strain-induced grain boundary migration and/or grain growth driven by interfacial energy gradient  We suggest that a similar mechanism was responsible for the textural evolution of perovskite in the Afrikanda ultramafic rocks  Chains of connected crystals with granoblastic-polygonal textures are also observed in disseminated magnetite ore from the Panzhihua layered mafic intrusion  China  In this intrusion  magnetite mostly forms net textures with densely packed clusters of polygonal grains with straight boundaries and 120° interfacial angles ( Fig  10c ) that resemble the granoblastic texture of T1 perovskite ( Figs  1a  3a  10a ; Pang et al  2007 ; Zhou et al  2005 )  The presence of both inclusion-rich euhedral grains and inclusion-poor anhedral grains is also observed in chromitite layers from the Oman ophiolite belt and the Fiskenaesset and Bushveld complexes ( Christiansen 1985 ; Ghisler 1976 ; Yudovskaya and Kinnaird 2010 )  The transition between these textures can be associated with late post-magmatic processes including re-equilibration  post-cumulus growth and contact metamorphism  The development of these inclusion-free grains and the associated massive textures at Afrikanda and other oxide deposits will be discussed in a subsequent publication  No conclusive and/or unifying model has been proposed to explain the ore distributions and textural transformations observed in the aforementioned mineral deposits  Traditionally  the formation of oxide-rich seams  bands  stringers and layers has been linked to magmatic processes  Perovskite  chromite and magnetite deposits share textural features that could imply that their development involved similar mechanisms  As we suggest for perovskite in the Afrikanda alkaline–ultramafic complex  the initial crystallisation of oxide minerals ( whether magmatic or not ) is followed by their textural re-equilibration at subsolidus temperatures  This re-equilibration produces perceptible changes in the morphology  size  orientation and compositional homogeneity of oxide mineral grains  From an exploration standpoint  the most important outcome of these processes is the accumulation of early-formed crystals into high-density oxide-rich zones and their coarsening and “ purification ” to form high-grade mineralized zones  Conclusions The textural and chemical examination of perovskite from the olivinites  clinopyroxenites and silicocarbonatites in the Afrikanda alkaline–ultramafic complex revealed three types of perovskite ( T1 to T3 ) and lead to the following conclusions : 1  Perovskite from olivinites  clinopyroxenite and silicocarbonatite yielded similar ages  with an average of 3683 ± 12 Ma  The perovskite and titanite ages support the contemporaneous emplacement of these lithologies at Afrikanda  The ages are slightly younger than previously published ages and could be due to discrepancies associated with the technique or reflect the timing of recrystallization  2  In ultramafic rocks ( olivinites and clinopyroxenites )  the progressive coarsening of perovskite from small  euhedral  disseminated grains into large anhedral and massive grains  and the various textures and zoning patterns is evidence of post-magmatic recrystallization and textural re-equilibration  We propose the post-magmatic development of perovskite involved three stages : ( 1 ) textural equilibration enabling the development of perovskite clusters and chains after initial perovskite crystallisation ; ( 2 ) grain rotation and coalescence of the small equilibrated polygonal clusters to form larger anhedral polycrystalline mosaics ; ( 3 ) in some areas the continued consolidation and coarsening transform the large polycrystalline perovskite into massive perovskite  3  The textural similarities between perovskite from Afrikanda and chromite and magnetite layers in various igneous complexes suggest similar post-magmatic coarsening processes are also involved in the development of other oxide ore deposits with monomineralic layers  ReferencesAuthor Correction : Solution-processed perovskite light emitting diodes with efficiency exceeding 15 % through additive-controlled

conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of single-junction perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) has rapidly boosted to 252 % [ 1 ]  approaching the Shockley-Queisser limit  A potential strategy to further elevate the PCE of single-junction PSCs is to fabricate all-perovskite tandem solar cells [ 23 ]  which is composed of a wide-bandgap ( 17–19 eV ) top sub-cell and a low-bandgap ( 09–12 eV ) bottom sub-cell  All-perovskite tandem solar cells have the potential to achieve PCE of over 30 %  However  the development of the all perovskite tandem photovoltaic has been severely impeded by the lack of highly efficient low-bandgap mixed Pb-Sn PSCs due to their large open-circuit voltage deficit  Realizing over 30 % efficiency tandem cell requires the low-bandgap PSC to be at least 21 %  Therefore  developing highly efficient low-bandgap mixed Pb-Sn PSCs plays a critical role in realizing high-performance all-perovskite based tandem solar cells [ 4 ]  Very recently  Tan et al  [ 5 ] from Nanjing University reported a monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cell with a certified efficiency of 248 %  which is the highest PCE for all-perovskite tandem solar cell to date  In this report  they proposed to add a small amount of metallic tin powder into the precursor solution of low-bandgap mixed Pb-Sn perovskites to inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+  The control yellow perovskite solution became orange-red rapidly when it was exposed to ambient air due to the oxidation of Sn2+  while the solution with tin powder still remained yellow ( Figure 1 ( a ) )  The added tin powder in the perovskite solution can readily reduce the already formed undesired Sn4+ into Sn2+ via the comproportionation reaction Sn+Sn4 + →2Sn2+  which effectively reduces the Sn vacancies inside the crystal grains and the trap density in mixed Pb-Sn perovskite film  By the assistance of tin powder reduction effect  a remarkably long carrier diffusion length of 3 μm has been achieved for low-bandgap mixed Pb-Sn perovskite film ( Figure 1 ( b ) )  Consequently  the champion device delivered an impressively high PCE of 211 % for low-bandgap mixed Pb-Sn PSCs ( Figure 1 ( c ) )  To fabricate monolithic all-perovskite solar cells ( Figure 1 ( d ) )  the authors cleverly employed atomic layer deposition ( ALD ) to form a compact thin layer of SnO2 instead of using sputtered indium tin oxide ( ITO )  since the thick ITO layer not only has parasitic absorption in the near-infrared spectral region but also easily induce shunting channels in the subcells  and the compact SnO2 layer by ALD can avoid damage to the wide-bandgap front sub-cells during the subsequent solution processing of low-bandgap bottom sub-cells  In addition  an ultrathin Au layer was inserted between SnO2 and PEDOT : PSS layer to promote charge carrier recombination in the tunnel junction ( Figure 1 ( d  e ) )  Based on the PCE advancement of low-bandgap mixed PbSn PSCs as bottom subcell and the tandem structure optimizations  the authors achieved certified PCE of 248 % of all-perovskite tandem solar cells retaining 90 % of initial PCE after 463 h under operational condition of one sun illumination ( Figure 1 ( f ) )  This work shines a light on how to fulfill the potential of high-performance all-perovskite tandem solar cells  © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH

materials are one of the most important class functional materials  which exhibit abundant physical properties such as ferroelectric  piezoelectric  dielectric  ferromagnetic  magnetoresistant  and multiferroic properties [ 1–5 ]  which are widely investigated in the past century  The perovskite oxide structures with a chemical formula ABO3 is coined from the prototype CaTiO3 mineral called perovskite  where A and B are two different metal ions with very different ionic sizes  and O anions are bonded to them  In a cubic perovskite structure  A ions occupy at cube corner positions ( 0  0  0 )  B ions sit at the body center position ( 1/2  1/2  1/2 )  and oxygen anions are located at face-centered positions such as ( 1/2  1/2  0 )  ( 1/2  0  1/2 )  and ( 0  1/2  1/2 )  as illustrated in Fig  1a  A-sited ions are coordinated by 12 oxygens  fitting into the dodecahedral site of the framework ( Fig  1b )  The B-sited ions are coordinated by six oxygens in octahedral coordination  which are transition metal ions such as 3d  4d  and/or 5d elements  Since most of the metal elements in the periodic table can be used for constructing perovskite oxides by rationally combining different metal ions at A- and B-sites [ 6 ]  therefore  the perovskite structure is featured to be structural simplicity and flexibility  By appropriate chemical substitutions at the A- and/or B-sites many desirable properties of perovskite oxides can be tailored  However  in practice  most perovskite oxides display a distorted structure rather than a cubic structure to accommodate the A- and B-cations  In the past century  the perovskite-type oxides are probably the most studied family of oxides  In the 1920s Goldschmidt et al  [ 1 ] carried out the pioneering structural works on the perovskites  Up to now  numerous perovskite oxide compounds with a variety of properties have been synthesized  It is also demonstrated that the diversity of the synthesized perovskite oxide compounds provides the wide spectrum of ferroelectric  dielectric  piezoelectric  magnetic  optical and multiferroic properties  which have important applications in memory devices  sensors  actuators  ceramic capacitors  and multiple-state memories and spintronic devices controlled by electric and magnetic fields [ 7–10 ]  Fig  1 figure 1 a Unit cell of a cubic ABO3 perovskite structure and b framework of an ABO3 perovskite structure where corner-shared oxygen octahedral extending in three dimensions Full size image Many perovskite oxide compounds prepared by solid-state reaction exhibit polycrystalline nature  The problems of this synthesis technique arise from that some starting oxides ( eg  PbO  Bi2O3 ) may vaporize  and the resulting microstructures of perovskite oxides obtained by this method exhibit poor chemical homogeneity  significant particle agglomeration  and coarse large particle sizes  To solve the above problems and to produce homogeneous and stoichiometric perovskite oxide powders  wet chemical routes such as sol–gel process [ 11  12 ]  hydrothermal synthesis [ 13 ]  microwave-hydrothermal synthesis [ 14 ]  and microemulsion synthesis [ 15 ] techniques have been developed in recent years  Perovskite oxide nanopowders and thin films with controlled levels of dopants have been prepared via sol–gel process by using metal alkoxides as precursors  Perovskite oxide thin films are also successfully grown by physical vapor deposition ( PVD ) or pulsed laser deposition ( PLD )  With the progress of the miniaturization of microelectronic devices  electronic devices based on perovskite-type 3D oxide nanostructures are highly required  which have recently been developed  For example  artificial 3D perovskite ( La  Pr  Ca ) MnO3 ( LPCMO ) nanoboxes have been fabricated by employing a combination of nanoimprint and PLD techniques for high performance correlated perovskite oxide nanoelectronics [ 16 ]  It is believed that the promising nanofabrication and nanoscale properties of the perovskite-type 3D oxide nanostructures will provide new possibilities for exploring novel size-induced perovskite oxide nanoelectronics  Generally  perovskite oxide nanostructured materials can be classified as zero-dimensional ( 0D ) ( nanopowders )  one-dimensional ( 1D ) ( such as nanowires  nanotubes  and nanorods )  two-dimensional ( 2D ) ( eg  thin films  nanodot arrays  and lamellae patterns )  and three-dimensional ( 3D ) ( such as vertically aligned nanowires  rods  or tubes ) nanostructures  In the past decades  much progress has been achieved in the fabrications of nanoscale perovskite oxide materials  In this chapter  we focus on the preparation methods of perovskite-type oxide materials  which cover bulk perovskite oxide ceramics  perovskite oxide nanopowders  perovskite ( 1D  2D  and 3D ) oxide nanostructures  First  we introduce the synthesized methods for bulk perovskite oxide ceramics and then summarize the prepared methods of perovskite oxide nanopowders  where solid  liquid  or gas phase precursors are used  Emphasizes are given to the preparation methods of perovskite ( 1D  2D  and 3D ) oxide nanostructures due to their superior physical and chemical properties  and the possibility for exploring intrinsic size effects of physical properties  Finally  we provide a future outlook of preparation methods of perovskite-type oxide materials  2 Preparation of Bulk Perovskite-Type Oxides The fabrication of perovskite-type oxide ceramics includes powder preparation  calcination  and final sintering  For the electrical property measurement  the perovskite-type oxide ceramic samples are needed to be machined  electroded  and poled  The poling process is performed by application of a DC field to orient the ferroelectric domains and induce piezoelectricity  A flowchart of a typical manufacturing process for perovskite piezoelectric ceramics with metal oxides as starting materials is shown in Fig  2  Since the electromechanical properties of piezoelectric ceramics are highly dependent upon the processing conditions  to obtain the best piezoelectric properties  the poling voltage and temperature should be optimized in poling process  The physical properties ( eg  ferroelectric  piezoelectric  and dielectric properties ) of perovskite oxide ceramics can be measured by different methods  Details can be found elsewhere [ 17 ]  Fig  2 figure 2 Flowchart of a typical oxide manufacturing process for perovskite piezoelectric oxide ceramics Full size image 3 Synthesis of Perovskite-Type Oxide Nanopowders 31 Solid-State Reaction Route Solid-state reaction method is one of the most conventional routes for synthesizing perovskite oxide nanopowders ( eg  BiFeO3 ( BFO )  KNbO3  etc  ) [ 18  19 ]  This process consists of weighting the starting materials ( the corresponding oxides or carbonates )  mixing  milling  and then calcinating them at elevated temperatures to form the perovskite phase  For example  BFO multiferroic nanoparticles are obtained by solid-state reaction method with Bi2O3 and Fe2O3 as the starting oxides in the temperature range of 800–830 °C  This process includes weighting the starting materials ( Bi2O3 and Fe2O3 )  mixing  milling  and calcinating them at high temperatures to form the perovskite phase  However  in the synthesis of perovskite stoichiometric BFO nanoparticles via solid-state reaction method  it is difficult to avoid the formation of impurity phases such as sillenite-type Bi25FeO39 and mullite-type Bi2Fe4O9  To understand the formation process of BFO nanoparticles  the reaction pathways in the solid-state synthesis of multiferroic BFO were investigated [ 20 ]  It was found that the diffusion of Bi3+ ions into Fe2O3 controlled the whole process which involves the formation of impurity phases  A schematic diagram illustrating the reaction paths in the solid-state synthesis of BFO nanopowders is shown in Fig  3 [ 20 ]  which explains why small amounts of impurity phases are always companied with BFO nanoparticles  In addition  the particle size of Fe2O3 powder controls the diffusion distance  which plays an important role in controlling the formation of unreacted phases in this system  A similar condition also appears in the formation of BT nanoparticles from a mixture of BaCO3 and TiO2  where the growth of BaTiO3 is governed by the diffusion of Ba2+ ions through a perovskite layer [ 21  22 ]  Besides the BT nanopowders  BaZrO3 ( BZ ) powders are also synthesized by a similar method [ 23 ]  Besides the conventional solid-state reaction method  other prepared methods such as molten salt synthesis  mechanical milling method  sol–gel process  and hydrothermal synthesis are also developed  which are described below  Fig  3 figure 3 Copyright © 2011  Elsevier Ltd A schematic diagram illustrating the reaction paths in the solid-state synthesis of BiFeO3  When the solid-state reaction proceeds  the penetration profile of the Bi ions into the Fe2O3 particles leads to the formation of different compounds  Initially  the 25:1 ( Bi : Fe ) sillenite phase is formed in the outer surface and the 1:1 BiFeO3 perovskite phase is developed as moving inside the structure  But the nuclei of the 1:2 Bi2Fe4O9 phase is also formed in deeper inside  constituting the diffusion/reaction front toward the iron oxide core  As the temperature increases diffusion will be favored and more perovskite may be formed in spite of the iron-rich nucleus  Due to the competition between the complete formation of BFO and the crystallization of Bi2Fe4O9 mullite crystals  the formation of BFO is blocked and eventually three phases coexist simultaneously  Reproduced with permission from [ 20 ]  M S Bernardo  T Jardiel  M

one of the simplest  most versatile  and cost-effective methods MSS method is widely used for preparing perovskite oxide powders [ 24 ]  For example  multiferroic BFO nanoparticles and La-doped BFO nanoparticles have been synthesized by MSS process in the NaCl [ 25  26 ]  NaCl–KCl [ 27  28 ]  NaCl–Na2SO4 [ 29 ]  or KNO3–NaNO3 [ 30 ] molten salts  The formation mechanisms of BFO have also been investigated  It is found that the molten salts ( eg  NaCl  NaCl–Na2SO4  KNO3–NaNO3 ) play an important role in promoting the formation of BFO phase  Recently  Pb-based perovskite relaxors such as Pb ( Mg1/3Nb2/3 ) O3 ( PMN )  Pb ( Ni1/3Nb2/3 ) O3 ( PFN ) [ 31 ]  Ba-based dielectric oxides such as Ba ( Sr  Ti ) O3  Ba ( Mg1/3Ta2/3 ) O3 [ 32 ]  and perovskite La1−xSrxMnO3 ( LSMO ) nanoparticles [ 33  34 ]  are also synthesized by MSS process  Overall  MSS method is a simple  cost-effective  and environmental-friendly approach for obtaining perovskite oxide nanopowders with uniform compositions  ideal morphology  and high purity  33 Mechanical Milling Method Recently  perovskite oxide nanoparticles such as BT  PT  PZ  and BST have been successfully synthesized by using several mechanical milling methods [ 35  36 ]  For example  by ball milling method perovskite manganite Pr07Ca03MnO3 nanopowders with average crystallite size of 29 nm were also prepared [ 37 ]  X-ray powder diffraction patterns revealed that the Pr07Ca03MnO3 nanopowders crystallized in an orthorhombic perovskite structure with a Pnma space group at room temperature  Magnetic measurements demonstrated that the Pr07Ca03MnO3 nanopowders underwent a phase transition from ferromagnetic phase to paramagnetic phase at ~120 K However  as viewed from the point of energy efficiency  the vibro-mill ( or vibratory mill or vibro-energy mill ) seems to be more attractive than the ball milling [ 35 ]  The vibro-milling has several advantages over the conventional ball milling produces  such as finer particles  narrower size distribution at a faster rate  simple equipment  low-cost starting precursors  and large-scale production of nanopowders  Therefore  the vibro-milling method can be recognized as a powerful method for synthesizing perovskite nanopowders  By choosing suitable milling time and the calcination conditions  high purity perovskite oxide nanopowders such as BT  PT  PZ with the smallest particle size of 100 nm  17 nm  and 31 nm can be mass produced  respectively [ 38 ]  Recently  complex perovskite oxides such as ( Bi  Na ) TiO3  ( K  Na ) NbO3  Pb ( Zr  Ti ) O3 have also been synthesized from micron-sized reactant powders via a mechanochemical reaction using a highly energetic ball milling process [ 39 ]  During the mechanical milling process  the mechanochemical activation by the heavy milling is the key step  which alters the physicochemical properties of the starting materials and the mechanism of synthesis  Welham [ 40 ] demonstrated that single-phase perovskite nanocrystalline BT powders were obtained in a very short milling time of ca  30–40 min  Recently  multiferroic BFO nanopowders have also been synthesized directly at room temperature by mechanochemical synthesis [ 41 ]  Although mechanochemical method has the ability to produce the products with particle sizes at nanometer scale at room temperature  its small batch sizes and very long processing times make it unsuitable in large-scale industrial applications  In addition  intensive ball milling process may result in unfavorable contaminations from the milling media  34 Wet Chemical Routes 341 Sol–Gel Processing Since the reacting species are homogenized at the atomic level in a sol–gel process  the diffusion distances are much reduced in comparison to the conventional solid-state reaction  As a consequence  the final products can be obtained at much lower temperatures by sol–gel process  Up to date multicomponent perovskite oxide nanopowders with a controlled stoichiometry have well been prepared by sol–gel process [ 42–44 ]  The processing parameters such as the starting materials  concentration  pH value  and heat treatment schedule have an important effect on the physical properties of perovskite nanopowders  A typical example is the sol–gel derived perovskite oxide BT nanopowders [ 45  46 ]  To control the grain size and its distribution  the process parameters of the gels ( eg  post-annealing temperature  time and atmosphere  heating rate ) must be optimized [ 47 ]  It is found that the annealing temperature plays an important role in controlling the BFO nanoparticle size  For example  the particle sizes of BFO nanoparticles annealed at 350 °C were less than 15 nm  whereas they are increased up to more than 100 nm as the annealed temperature was increased up to ~650 °C [ 48  49 ]  In order to obtain the BFO nanoparticles with controlled grain size  shape  and crystallinity without additional sintering steps  modified sol–gel techniques such as Pechini method  polymer complex solution  and glycol-gel reaction were developed to synthesize BFO nanoparticles  Now the BFO nanoparticles with sizes from a few nanometers to micrometers can be obtained by carefully controlling the processing parameters such as solid-state polymerization and the heat treatment process  342 Alkoxide-Hydroxide Sol–Precipitation Synthesis Alkoxide–hydroxide sol–precipitation process was first proposed by Flaschen [ 50 ]  which is widely used to produce crystalline perovskite oxide nanopowders at low temperatures and no further calcination at high temperatures are required  Perovskite BT powders have been synthesized by this method [ 50–53 ]  In this process  the hydrolysis and condensation processes are found to be the key processes of crystal growth  To well control the particle size and the shape of precipitates the water content and its additional method to the reaction system must be optimized  It is reported that BT nanopowders can be synthesized at low temperature as 80–100 °C via alkoxide-hydroxide method by using aqueous alkaline solution as a starting material [ 52 ]  That is ascribed to the hydrolysis–condensation reaction taking place instantly upon mixing the aqueous and alcohol solutions  However  the final products exhibit much agglomerated and inhomogeneous morphologies  which are unsuitable for the next powder processing and sintering  By using the solid barium hydroxide octahydrate as starting material  it is possible to modify the hydrolysis–condensation reaction due to the water molecules released in situ as Ba ( OH ) 2∙8H2O was dissolved in the alcoholic solution  The experimental results have shown that BT nanoparticles with sizes smaller than 6 nm first nucleate at 50 °C without forming the intermediate TiO2 anatase  and corner-sharing TiO6 octahedra are formed at 60 °C  The average sizes of BT powders are increased up to about 75 nm at 80 °C  and the BT nanopowders exhibit an anomalous lattice expansion with a relatively high tetragonality [ 54 ]  343 Hydrothermal Routes 3431 Hydrothermal Process The hydrothermal method  also named as the autoclave method  involves heating an aqueous suspension of insoluble salts in an autoclave at a moderate temperature and pressure where a desired phase structure is formed  It is widely used for preparing perovskite nanoparticles due to synergetic effects from solvent  temperature  and pressure  which can provide stable final products and prevent the formation of impure phases  Perovskite BFO nanoparticles with controllable particle size and morphology have been synthesized by hydrothermal synthesis [ 55–60 ]  For example  Han et al  [ 55 ] reported on Bi12Fe063O18945 nanocrystals  nano- and submicrometer-sized BFO  and Bi2Fe4O9 nanoparticles with different shapes synthesized under special hydrothermal conditions  Similarly  Wang et al  [ 56 ] also reported on hydrothermal synthesis of bismuth ferrite compounds  which were assisted by using various alkali metal ions such as K+  Na+  and Li+ ions  Pure BFO nanoparticles were synthesized at 200 °C by using 7 mol l−1 KOH and 12 mol l−1 KOH  whereas NaOH and LiNO3 solutions can stabilize Bi2Fe4O9 and Bi12 ( Bi05Fe05 ) O195 phases  respectively  in the final products regardless of their concentrations  When KNO3 is used as the mineralizer  phase-pure BFO nanoparticles with particle size of ~5 nm are synthesized  These results reveal that the alkali metal ions ( K+  Na+  and Li+ ) play an important role in the formation of rhombohedral BFO  orthorhombic Bi2Fe4O9  and cubic Bi12 ( Bi05Fe05 ) O195 nanoparticles [ 61 ]  The reaction mechanism for the synthesis of the BFO nanoparticles by the hydrothermal method can be understood from the dissolution–crystallization process  In this process  Bi3+ and Fe3+ ions are first transformed into hydroxide Fe ( OH ) 3 and Bi ( OH ) 3 in the precursors  and then they are dissolved in the precursors under the presence of alkaline mineralizers ( eg  KOH  NaOH  LiOH ) in hydrothermal conditions  As the Bi3+ and Fe3+ ionic concentrations in the alkaline solution are larger than their saturated concentrations  the BFO phase starts to be nucleated and precipitated from the supersaturated hydrothermal fluid  following the crystal growth [ 62 ]  Therefore  the particle size and morphology of BFO particles are closely related to the nucleation and crystal growth rate  which in turn are affected by the degree of supersaturation  A highly supersaturated precursor with high KOH concentration and high pH value will lead to a high nucleation rate but low growth rate  and thus smaller particle size [ 59 ]  In addition  the cationic radii of mineralizers have great effect on the size and morphology of nanoparticles  Hojamberdiev et al  [ 63 ] reported that the average particle sizes of BFO powders synthesized under mineralizers of LiOH  NaOH  and KOH  were 64 nm  120 nm  200 nm  respectively  indicating that the average particle size was increased with the cationic radii of the added mineralizers  Hydrothermal reaction is usually performed at temperature below 250 °C and even as low as 130 °C  much lower than the sol–gel process  While the perovskite oxide nanopowders are synthesized directly by hydrothermal process  however  their products are usually highly defective in their crystallographic structure [ 64  65 ]  For example  in the BT nanopowders synthesized by hydrothermal method there exists structural defects such as lattice OH− ions and barium vacancies ( )  The latter one is created at the surfaces of particles to maintain the whole electroneutrality of nanoparticle [ 64  65 ]  Due to the coexistence of point defects such as barium  titanium  and oxygen vacancies and their annihilation each other the BT lattice becomes unstable  Since the point defects with different charges may compensate each other to neutrality  some vanishing vacancies are formed upon dehydration  leading to the formation of intragranular pores ( shown in Fig  4a )  which partly disappears upon grain growth above 800 °C  In the MLCCs ceramics made from the hydrothermal BT powders  a strange expansion called “ bloating phenomena ” ( shown in Fig  4b ) appeared at the final stage of sintering ceramics  which was resulted from the inherently OH− ions and protons formed during the hydrothermal process [ 66 ]  Fig  4 figure 4 Copyright © 2005  American Ceramic Society a TEM image of the intragranular pores in the hydrothermal

nonaqueous solution ( eg  NH3  methanol  ethanol  and n-propanol )  which has the following advantages in comparison with the hydrothermal process [ 67 ] : ( i ) the reaction occurs under mild conditions and gives cubic-phase perovskite powder ; and ( ii ) the powders with particle size on the nanometer scale  exhibiting low agglomeration and a narrow particle-size distribution  due to the differences between the solvents  Up to date  several attempts have been made to synthesize superfine BT nanopowder by solvothermal synthesis [ 67–69 ]  For example  using benzyl alcohol as solvent  BT and BZ nanoparticles were synthesized by solvothermal process at relatively low temperatures of 200–220 °C [ 70 ]  TEM image of the synthesized BT nanoparticles is shown in Fig  5a  and an inset in which is their selected area electron diffraction ( SAED ) pattern  indicating the formation of cubic and tetragonal modifications of the BT perovskite structure  HRTEM images of two isolated particles with orientations in the [ 110 ] and [ 111 ] directions are shown in Fig  5b and c  respectively  Figure 5d is a fast Fourier transform ( FFT ) pattern ( equivalent to experimental electron diffraction pattern of the local region ) obtained from the HRTEM image is shown in Fig  5c  which confirms the well crystallization of the particles without defects  By using alcohol-based solvents such as ethanol  methanol  and n-propanol  nanosized ( ~20–60 nm ) cubic-phase BT powders were obtained [ 67 ]  However  the tetragonal BT nanopowders with sizes of 50–100 nm were synthesized by using EtOH as a solvent [ 68 ]  It was found that the particle size was dependent upon the feedstock concentration ( eg  the precursor concentration )  With decreasing the particle size from 89 to 58 nm  the amount of the tetragonal phase in the powder was decreased from 85 to 57 %  and the cell parameter ratio ( c/a ) also decreased from 10080 to 10071  Fig  5 figure 5 Copyright Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH

microwave-hydrothermal ( M-H ) process is a modified hydrothermal process  in which microwave is introduced to enhance the crystallization kinetics of hydrothermal process  In 1992  Komarneni et al  [ 69 ] performed the pioneering works on the microwave-hydrothermal synthesis of inorganic materials in liquid phase  and later they investigated the differences between the conventional hydrothermal syntheses ( performed with conventional means of heating ) and the M-H syntheses ( performed under heating special autoclaves with microwaves )  It is found that this process has some distinct advantages such as rapid internal heating  cost savings  as compared with the conventional hydrothermal synthesis  Up to date  the M-H process is widely used to rapidly synthesize numerous perovskite oxide nanopowders such as BT [ 71  72 ]  BST [ 73 ]  and BFO [ 74  75 ]  Microwave heating provides a new route for faster synthesizing novel inorganic nanomaterials  especially in the field of the perovskite oxide nanopowders  and it also allows to utilize more environmentally friendly solvents  yielding cleaner and purer products  35 Chemical or Physical Vapor Deposition Besides wet chemical solution methods  perovskite oxide nanopowders are also prepared by vapor deposition methods  in which the initial step is the preparation of gaseous precursor molecules by using suitable physical or chemical methods in aersol reactors [ 76  77 ]  Next  the precursor molecules react to each other in the vapor phase to produce tiny nuclei of the desired phase ( namely gas-to-particle conversion )  Subsequently  the primary particles become coalescence via collision  forming agglomerates linked together by van der Waals force [ 78 ]  The mechanism involved in the gas phase condensation process allows one to link the properties of gaseous precursors to the nanoparticles formed  Among the different physical vapor deposition processes such as thermal evaporation  magnetic sputtering  and laser ablation the main difference is their interaction process used to generate a vapor and/or plasma by the removal of the target material  The type  density  energy  and excitation of atoms  molecules  clusters  and micro- and macro-particles within the generated vapor ( plasma ) lead to different microstructures of nanocrystalline particles and thin films  The important parameters involved in the processing are time  temperature  and the amount of particles produced per unit volume  The decisive characteristics of the prepared nanoparticles include the size distribution of the primary particles  the grain boundaries  the pore sizes  the defect concentrations  and crystallinity  Recently  monodisperse PZT nanoparticles ( 4–20 nm in diameter ) are prepared by gas phase deposition [ 79 ]  This process involves several steps  including the production of amorphous and irregularly shaped PZT nanoparticles ; crystallization of the particles by an online thermal treatment ; screening the crystallized particles by a low-pressure differential mobility analyzer to yield monodisperse  highly pure  and single-crystalline PZT nanoparticles  Monodisperse perovskite oxide nanoparticles produced by this method not only provide good opportunity for investigating the size effects in ferroelectric oxide nanoparticles but also are useful for the fabrication of ferroelectric nanodevices  4 Preparation Methods of 1D Perovskite-Type Oxide Nanostructures In the past decade  many 1D perovskite oxide nanostructures have been prepared  The most used techniques are “ bottom-up ” routes ( such as template-based synthesis  hydrothermal synthesis  molten salt synthesis  electrospinning  solution-based chemical decomposition )  and “ top-down ” approaches ( such as focus ion beam ( FIB ) milling  nanoimprint lithography ( NIL ) techniques )  Basically  the prepared methods for 1D perovskite nanostructures can be divided into two categories  One is template-free synthesis  and the other one is template-assisted synthesis  In this subsequent section  the recent progress in the fabrications of 1D perovskite oxide nanostructures is summarized  41 Template-Free Synthesis Up to date  several template-free methods such as hydro/solvothermal synthesis  molten salt method  electrospinning process have been used to synthesize 1D perovskite-type oxide nanostructures ( eg  nanowires  nanotubes )  For example  Joshi et al  [ 80 ] reported the synthesis of single-crystalline perovskite BT and ST nanowires by solution-based template-free method  Single-crystalline BT [ 81 ]  PT [ 82  83 ]  and PZT [ 84 ] nanowires were also synthesized by template-free hydrothermal method  Since no organic templates are used in this process  there is no need to remove the templates after synthesis of perovskite oxide nanowires  Single-crystalline BT  ST  and PT nanowires are also synthesized by molten salt method [ 85–87 ]  The key factors for nanowire formation by molten salt method are well controlling the surface and interface energies of precursors and the selected molten salts  Monocrystalline BT nanowires are also synthesized by a modified hydrothermal process with alkali metal titanates as synthetic precursors [ 88 ]  Tetragonal PT single-crystalline nanowires with necklace-like morphology are also synthesized by electrospinning method [ 89 ]  Their lengths are in the range of tens to several tens of micrometers  and the diameters vary from 100 to 200 nm  Similarly  tetragonal PZT nanofibers are synthesized by a sol–gel electrophoresis  which is used for constructing nanogenerators for mechanical energy harvesting [ 90  91 ]  Multiferroic BFO nanowires were also synthesized by template-free hydrothermal method [ 92 ]  The diameter of an individual BFO nanowire was in the range of 45–200 nm and the length varied from hundreds of nanometers to several microns  Besides the perovskite ferroelectric oxide nanowires  single-crystalline perovskite manganite nanowires such as La05Ca05MnO3 nanowires with an orthorhombic perovskite structure were also synthesized by a hydrothermal method [ 93 ]  They grew along [ 100 ] and had uniform diameter ( ~80 nm )  and the lengths varied from several to several tens of micrometers  Similarly  single-crystalline La05Sr05MnO3  La05Ba05MnO3  and Pr05Ca05MnO3 nanowires with a cubic perovskite structure were synthesized by hydrothermal method [ 94–96 ]  In the Pr05Ca05MnO3 nanowires the charge ordering transition was suppressed and a ferromagnetic phase was observed  whereas the antiferromagnetic transition disappeared  Besides the above “ bottom-up ” approaches based on chemical routes  the “ top-down ” approaches such as FIB milling process is also used to fabricate 1D perovskite ferroelectric nanostructures such BT nanocolumns cut from BT single crystal [ 97  98 ]  This process offers the advantage of user-defined morphological control of the produced nanostructures exception time-consuming and low-throughput characters  Perovskite oxide nanotubes ( PONTs ) are also synthesized by using template-free method such as hydrothermal synthesis  For example  BT [ 99 ] and BST [ 100 ] nanotube arrays were fabricated on titanium substrates by hydrothermal method  Isolated crystalline BT and ST PONTs were also prepared by hydrothermal process performed at low temperature  where TiO2 nanotubes were used as a bona fide precursor materials [ 101 ]  42 Template-Assisted Methods The template-assisted method is a high efficient method for mass production of regular nanostructured arrays  To date  the popular templates are colloidal monolayers  anodic aluminum oxide ( AAO )  block copolymers ( BCPs )  and nanoimprint molds [ 102–105 ]  Through template-assisted methods  1D perovskite oxide nanostructures ( eg  nanowires  nanotubes  nanorings  nanobelts ) have been prepared  which offer the following advantages : ( a ) high-density regular nanostructured arrays ; ( 2 ) large surface-to-volume ratio ; and ( 3 ) dimension sizes of the final products with well control by the channels of the template  Among the commonly used template-assisted methods  the sol–gel template method is a popular one  which is widely used to fabricate highly ordered perovskite oxide nanostructures such as BT [ 106–108 ] nanowires  PT [ 109–111 ] nanotubes  and PZT [ 112–114 ] nanowires  In addition  perovskite manganite nanowires such as La1−xCaxMnO3 ( LCMO  x = 020 ) nanowires with nearly uniform diameter of about 30 nm  and ordered array of La067Sr033MnO3 nanowires with diameter of 60–70 nm and length up to tens of microns were also prepared using a simple sol–gel process combined with AAO as template [ 115 ]  Following the success of this method  perovskite oxide La0825Sr0175MnO3 nanowires were also synthesized  which exhibited polycrystalline perovskite structure [ 116 ]  Besides perovskite oxide nanowires  perovskite oxide nanotubes are also fabricated by using a sol–gel template-based method  Hernandez et al  [ 117 ] reported the pioneering works on the synthesis of perovskite BT and PT nanotubes by using AAO templates involving the so–gel technique  By the same method  PZT nanotubes [ 117–122 ] and multiferroic BFO nanotubes [ 123–127 ] have been synthesized  Although the sizes and shapes of the nanotubes are easily controlled by the used templates  the nanotubes synthesized by template-based methods in general exhibit polycrystalline structure  which is ascribed to the heterogeneous nucleation on the pore walls ; few single-crystalline perovskite oxide nanotubes are synthesized by this method  Anti-ferroelectric PZ PONTs were synthesized by pulse laser deposition within AAO templates [ 128 ]  which were composed of nanoparticles with sizes of 3–7 nm and the wall thickness was about 10 nm  Sol–gel electrodeposition process was also used to fabricate PZT nanotube arrays  where the channels of the AAO template were filled by prepared PZT sol driven by DC electrophoretic voltages [ 129 ]  Thus  the filling effect was greatly increased  Besides the negative templates  positive templates such as silicon and ZnO nanowires are also used to fabricate ferroelectric PZT nanotubes and metal-ferroelectric-metal composite nanotubes ( Pt/PZT/Pt ) by magnetron sputtering and/or pulsed laser deposition [ 130 ]  Perovskite manganite nanotube arrays ( eg  highly ordered La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 nanotubes ) were also reported  which are prepared by combining AAO template-assisted synthesis with microwave irradiation [ 131 ]  This method provides a convenient route to fabricate nanotube arrays at relative low temperatures  By using porous polycarbonate templates rare-earth manganese oxide nanotubes with nominal composition of La0325Pr030Ca0375MnO3 are also synthesized by pore wetting with the liquid precursor and then followed by microwave irradiation and further calcination at 800 °C [ 132 ]  Perovskite La059Ca041CoO3 nanotubes are also prepared by a sol–gel template method [ 133 ]  By using a template-inorganic precursor under relatively low-temperature calcination perovskite LaNiO3 nanotubes were also synthesized [ 134 ]  It was found that the LaNiO3 nanotubes exhibited a polycrystalline structure  which were composed of very small crystals with size about 3–5 nm  Ferroelectric PZT nanorings [ 135 ] and their periodic arrays [ 136 ] are also fabricated  Their microstructures are well characterized  Figure 6 shows the morphology of the resulting perovskite oxide PZT nanorings in bright-field TEM ( Fig  6a ) and dark-field STEM contrast ( Fig  6b and c )  The dimensions of the PZT nanorings are dependent on the channel size of the AAO template  but the narrowest of pores made are able to produce rings of the form illustrated in Fig  6c  The perovskite crystallography nature of the PZT nanoring was confirmed by its SAED shown in Fig  7a  and also revealed by direct imaging of lattice fringes Fig  7b  The morphology of periodic arrays of PZT nanorings is revealed by SEM image ( Fig  8a )  and the cross-sectional TEM image ( Fig  8b ) demonstrates that the height of the PZT nanorings was in the order of ~10 nm [ 136 ]  Fig  6 figure 6 Copyright © 2006  American Institute of Physics a Bright-field cross-sectional TEM image of the PZT nanorings  b  c Dark-field STEM images

Ordered BiFeO3 nanorings are also successfully fabricated by combining AAO template-assisted PLD with ion beam etching techniques [ 137 ]  Their morphologies were revealed by AFM and TEM images ( Fig

perovskite oxide thin films  nanodot arrays  lamellae patterns  nanosheets  nanoplates  nanowalls  which have important applications in the modern microelectronics  Therefore  in the past few years  several methods have been developed to synthesize perovskite oxide 2D nanostructures [ 140–142 ]  In this section  we introduce the fabrications of perovskite oxide thin films or multilayers  2D perovskite ferroelectric oxide nanostructures based on planar structures  and perovskite oxide nanosheets  51 Perovskite Oxide Thin Films or Multilayers The growths of perovskite oxide thin films or multilayers are the process of converting the starting materials into the forms of films or multilayers on a substrate from their atoms  molecules  or ions in a gaseous state  The widely used methods for growth perovskite oxide thin films or multilayers include physical vapor deposition ( PVD ) methods such as PLD  RF magnetron sputtering  and chemical methods such as chemical solution deposition ( CSD )  chemical vapor deposition ( CVD ) and metalorganic chemical vapor deposition ( MOCVD )  and molecular beam epitaxy ( MBE )  Here  we shortly introduce widely used techniques such as PLD  CSD  CVD and MOCVD  and MBE  52 Pulsed Laser Deposition ( PLD ) In 1965 Smith and Turner first used the PLD technique to grow dielectric thin films [ 143 ]  now the PLD technique becomes a popular method for thin film growth  The most important feature of the PLD process is the ability to achieve the compositions of the films almost identical with that of the target  even though the target involves a complex stoichiometry  By controlling the PLD process parameters ( eg  the laser influence  wavelength  pulse-duration and repetition rate  target to substrate distance  substrate temperature  chamber pressure ) many perovskite oxide thin films or multilayers can be grown  Good reviews on the epitaxial growth of perovskite oxide thin films and superlattices can be found in the literature [ 140–142 ]  521 Chemical Solution Deposition ( CSD ) CSD is an effective route for fabricating thin films with the advantages of low-cost  easy set-up  and coating of large areas  The development of which for perovskite oxide thin films is dated to the mid-1980s [ 144  145 ]  Up to date  many perovskite oxide thin films have been synthesized by CSD method [ 146–148 ]  In general  there are four basic steps during the growth of perovskite oxide thin films : ( a ) precursor solution preparation ; ( b ) spin- or dip-coating the solution on substrate ; ( c ) pyrolysis of the deposited solution at low temperatures ; ( d ) crystallization of the films at high temperatures [ 147 ]  The growth rate and the degree of crystallinity of perovskite oxide thin films are dependent upon the temperature of the solution  To obtain the films with the desired thickness  the deposition/pyrolysis/crystallization steps are usually repeated several times  The processing factors such as precursor solution concentration  substrate and ( eventual ) bottom electrode stack  and annealing temperature play an important role in affecting the film nucleation and growth  Details can be found in good reviews contributed from Schwartz [ 146 ]  Bassiri-Gharb et al  [ 147 ]  and Zhang et al  [ 148 ]  522 CVD and MOCVD CVD is one of the most popular routes to prepare perovskite oxide thin films in a large area with high quality and good performance  The key feature of the CSD process is the prepared materials that are required to have high vapor pressure using as the precursor and the substrate should be heated to a particular temperature to promote the deposition reaction as well as the motion of adatoms [ 149 ]  In the CVD process  the film composition and structure are greatly dependent upon the substrate temperature  the precursor delivery ratio  and the vaporizer temperature  In order to deposit successfully the complex multicomponent perovskite oxide thin films with uniform compositions over a large area  the used precursors should have matched thermal properties and reasonable vapor pressures  To better control the film quality some modified CVD technologies based on liquid injection [ 150 ] or the use of aerosol formation [ 151 ] have been developed  For example  perovskite PZT and lanthanum barium manganite ( La1−xBaxMnO3 ) thin films were synthesized by liquid injection CVD method [ 152 ]  and perovskite thin films of La1−xSrxMnO3 were deposited by aerosol and plasma-assisted CVD method [ 153 ]  Metal-organic chemical vapor deposition ( MOCVD ) is used to grow perovskite oxide thin films and superlattices [ 154 ]  This technique has some advantages over other physical deposition processes such as good control in film stoichiometry  high crystallization quality  and the ability to coat complex shapes and large areas  To meet the diversity of requirements  different MOCVD variants are developed such as low-pressure MOCVD  atmospheric pressure MOCVD  direct liquid injection MOCVD  and plasma-enhanced MOCVD [ 155 ]  In injection MOCVD process  the production of microdroplets of precursor solution is controlled by a high-speed electro-valve  which is injected into the evaporator system  The appropriate growth rates for different deposited materials are adjusted by the frequency as well as the time of the injection  Therefore  the final film stoichiometry can be well adjusted by controlling the respective concentrations of the precursors in the precursor liquid source  Up to date  injection MOCVD is widely used to grow ferroelectric perovskite oxide thin films such as BST [ 156 ]  PT [ 157 ]  PZT [ 158 ]  and BFO [ 159 ]  and perovskite oxide superlattices such as ( BT/ST ) n and ( LSMO/STO ) n [ 160 ]  523 Molecular Beam Epitaxy ( MBE ) The growth of perovskite oxide thin films by MBE method can be thought of as atomic spray painting  in which alternately shuttered elemental sources are employed to control the cation stoichiometry precisely  thus producing perovskite oxide thin films with high quality  The key steps for MBE growth of multicomponent oxides are the controlling oxide substrates terminated at well-defined ionic planes and monitoring the deposition of individual molecular/atomic layers  and so on  Reflection high-energy electron diffraction ( RHEED ) is widely used in MBE for the in situ monitoring the growing surface  Up to date  MBE has been used to grow perovskite oxide thin films and epitaxial heterostructures with exceptional quality [ 161–163 ]  53 2D Perovskite Oxide Nanostructures Based on Planar Structures 531 Top-Down Methods Up to date different “ top-down ” methods such as electron beam lithography ( EBL )  nanoimprint lithography ( NIL )  have been used to fabricate 2D perovskite oxide nanostructures based on planar structures  For example  Alexe et al  performed the pioneering researches on the 2D arrangement of perovskite ferroelectric oxide nanostructures to be used for high-density ferroelectric memories [ 164 ]  By using EBL method regular arrays of SrBi2Ta2O9 and PZT nanoisland capacitors with lateral dimensions ~100 nm were successfully fabricated  The BT nanodots were also fabricated by FIB methodology cutting from the BT single crystal  and the domain structures within the BT dots were examined [ 165 ]  532 Bottom-up Methods Besides the top-down methods  bottom-up methods such as template-assisted synthesis have been used to fabricate 2D perovskite oxide nanostructures based on lateral arrays of nanodots  For example  2D ordered ferroelectric oxide nanodots of BT  PZT  and SrBi2Ta2O9 with narrow size distributions are fabricated by template-assisted “ bottom-up ” synthetic approaches such as nanosphere lithography ( NSL ) [ 166 ]  In order to deposit multilayers of materials from the same template and to increase their crystallization quality of perovskite oxide ferroelectrics  silicon nitride shadow mask  AAO membranes  and gold nanotube membranes have been used as nanostencil masks for the fabrication of 2D arrays of perovskite oxide nanodots  For example  Lee et al  [ 167 ] fabricated the PZT nanodot arrays on the Pt/MgO substrates by using ultrathin AAO membranes as a stencil mask and PLD method  The density of ordered arrays of individually addressable Pt/PZT/Pt nanocapacitors can reach 176 Gb/inch2  which have promising applications in the ferroelectric memories with ultrahigh density  54 Perovskite Oxide Nanosheets Perovskite oxide nanosheets are also grown by wet chemical methods  Gao et al  [ 168 ] reported the synthesis of 2D single-crystal perovskite ZnSnO3 nanoplates with the ( 111 ) facets as exposed plate surfaces via a one-step hydrothermal reaction  The morphology of as-synthesized perovskite ZnSnO3 nanoplates is shown in Fig  12  where the typical SEM and TEM images reveal the as-synthesized hexagonal plate-like ZnSnO3 samples  The lattice fringes with spacing of 026 nm are clearly resolved in HRTEM image of an individual nanoplate  indicating the single-crystalline nature of the ZnSnO3 nanoplate  The corresponding SAED is shown as inset in Fig  12d  also confirms the single-crystalline nature of the ZnSnO nanoplate  Rectangular perovskite La2Ti2O7 platelets are also grown by molten salt method [ 169 ]  where the Na2SO4–K2SO4 flux was used as molten salt and analytical grade TiO2 and La2O3 oxides were used as the starting materials  While the syntheses of perovskite oxide 2D nanostructures are still at the embryonic stage  the applications of perovskite oxide 2D nanostructures in oxide microelectronic devices are full of great challenges  Much work remains to be done in this direction  Fig  12 figure 12 Copyright © 2017

approaches  The “ bottom-up ” approaches to the fabrication of nanostructures start at the atomic or molecular level  and solution-based routes ( eg  sol–gel-based CSD  templating  and hydro/solvothermal synthesis ) are the most commonly employed in the this approaches for fabricating 3D perovskite-type oxide nanostructures ( ie  vertically aligned nanowires  rods or tubes )  The “ top-down ” approaches ( eg  FIB milling and some lithographical methods such as NIL ) to fabrication of nanostructures include carving away the bulk ferroelectric material and creating coherently and continuously ordered nanosized structures by FIB technique [ 170 ]  For example  by FIB method Rémiens et al  created PZT nanoislands ( with diameter of 50 nm )  which were milled from an amorphous film layer and subsequently converted into crystalline PZT thin film by high-temperature annealing [ 171 ]  The advantages of “ top-down ” approaches for fabricating 3D perovskite oxide nanostructures via FIB milling are the precision positioning and well controlling in the shapes and sizes of the fabricated nanostructures  However  the FIB milling technique has significant drawbacks such as slow milling and patterning speeds  especially for fabricating larger structures  and it is not suitable for volume patterning nanostructures  In addition  problems are also arisen at the nanoscale due to the induced damages by the incident ions at the surfaces of the samples  Considering that the properties of 3D perovskite oxide nanostructures are much sensitive to their structures and ordered alignments  the fabrication of a large-scale nanostructure arrays with well control in the morphology and structure becomes much important [ 104 ]  To achieve the above goal  several techniques including photolithography  electron beam lithography  and scanning probe lithography have been used [ 172  173 ]  Recently  PLD in combination with the AAO template has also been used to prepare 3D perovskite ferroelectric nanostructures  Ferroelectric PZT nanocapacitor arrays with Pt top electrodes were fabricated with ultrahigh density of ~Tb/inch2 density [ 170 ]  Besides the AAO template-assisted fabrication  other methods such as 3D nanotemplate PLD have also been used to prepare 3D perovskite oxide nanostructures  In this method  an inclined substrate deposition onto the side surfaces of a 3D nanopatterned substrate is used as a 3D nanotemplate  which is schematically shown in Fig  13  and details can be found in reference [ 174 ]  As one example  crystalline ( La0275Pr035Ca0375 ) MnO3 ( LPCMO ) nanobox were grown on a MgO ( 001 ) substrate using 3D nanotemplate [ 16 ]  Figure 14 illustrates the fabrication procedure of the LPCMO nanobox  their typical SEM image  and the relationship between the wall-width of the LPCMO nanobox and the deposited time  It is found that the wall-width of the LPCMO nanoboxes can be controlled in the range of 30–160 nm by changing the deposition time  These LPCMO nanoboxes exhibit an insulator-metal transition at higher temperature than that in the corresponding film  which has promising appliactions in the fields of oxide spintronics  3D nanotemplate PLD technique provides a novel route to fabricate 3D perovskite oxide nanostructures  Fig  13 figure 13 Copyright © 2012  IOP Publishing Ltd Schematic flowchart of

in preparation methods of perovskite-type oxide materials  with a wide range scope from bulk perovskite oxide ceramics to perovskite oxide nanopowders  and to perovskite 1D  2D  and 3D oxide nanostructures  Conventional solid-state reaction is usually used to synthesize perovskite oxide ceramics  However  their resulting microstructures exhibit poor chemical homogeneity  serious particle agglomeration  and coarse large grains  Advances toward nanoscale oxide electronics have stimulated interests in the fields of perovskite oxide nanopowders  Therefore  the synthesis methods of perovskite oxide nanopowders with controlled particle size  morphology  and stoichiometry are highly required to be developed  Over the past decades  various synthesized methods using solid  liquid  or gas phase precursors have been developed to synthesize high purity  ultra-fine  and agglomerate-free perovskite oxide nanopowders  1D perovskite oxide nanostructures such as perovskite oxide nanowires and nanotubes are important structural units for constructing nanoscale electronic devices  and their novel properties open up new avenues of applications in the fields of electronics  energy harvesting  data storage  Both top-down-based direct lithography techniques and chemical bottom-up-based methods based on a solution or a dispersion ( ie  deposition in AAO templates  electrospinning  hydrothermal  and molten salt method ) have been developed to synthesize 1D perovskite oxide nanostructures  Similarly  these methods are also used to fabricate 2D perovskite oxide nanostructures  which are now considered to be excellent candidates for future oxide electronic applications  Recently  3D nanotemplate PLD technique has been developed to fabricate 3D perovskite oxide nanostructures ( eg  perovskite ( La0275Pr035Ca0375 ) MnO3 nanobox arrays ) with controllable size and morphology  This technique makes use of epitaxial thin film deposition technique and nanolithography together  which can be used to fabricate nanoboxes with tunable wall-widths or the diameters  and their adjacent distance is reduced down to 10 nm  realizing the formation of 3D perovskite oxide nanostructures beyond the resolution limitations of top-down methods  3D perovskite-type oxide nanostructures such as ( La0275Pr035Ca0375 ) MnO3 nanobox array structures fabricated by 3D nanotemplate PLD technique  exhibit an insulator-metal transition at higher temperature than that in the corresponding thin film  which provide a way to tune the physical properties of CMR oxide nanostructures  and find a promising application in oxide nanoelectronics taking the advantage of the huge electronic/spintronic phase transition  At present the growth techniques of perovskite oxide thin films used for perovskite oxide nanoelectronic devices are still in their infancy  and accurate compositional and structural controls at the atomic layer level are highly required  Recently  new techniques such as laser-MBE and reactive molecular beam epitaxy are developed  which permit to grow perovskite oxide thin films with thickness down to a mololayer limit [ 175 ]  Therefore  such 2D perovskite ultrathin films are as useful as graphene in exploring unconventional 2D correlated quantum phases and find promising applications in multifunctional electronic nanodevices

over 20 % external quantum efficiency  However  the development of perovskite light-emitting diodes with blue emission remains a great challenge  which retards further development of full-color displays and white-light illumination based on perovskite emissive materials  Here  firstly  through composition and dimensional engineering  we prepare quasi-two-dimensional perovskite thin films

the PEDOT : PSS/perovskite hybrid film  Through modulating the position of the recombination zone  we activate the majority of quasi-two-dimensional perovskite crystals  and thus demonstrate the most

perovskites have shown promising potential in a series of optoelectronic applications such as solar cells  light-emitting diodes ( LEDs )  photodetectors  and lasers1234  The booming research on metal halide perovskites can be attributed to their superior optoelectronic properties such as high absorption coefficient  long charge-carrier diffusion length  high photoluminescence quantum yield ( PLQY )  and high defect tolerance5678  In particular  owing to the nature of their facile color tunability  solution processability  and sharp emission  metal halide perovskites have been successfully applied in LEDs  extending the family of emitters9101112131415  Substantial progress has been made over the past several years in perovskite LEDs by modulating the microstructures of the perovskite emitter  suppressing surface defects  and utilizing dimensional engineering  Based on these strategies  perovskite LEDs with near-infrared  red  and green emissions have reached over 20 % external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) 161718  However  compared with the efficient near-infrared  red  and green perovskite LEDs  blue perovskite LEDs currently still suffer from inferior performance  Improving performance remains a great challenge and retards the development of possible applications such as full-color displays and white-light illumination based on perovskite LEDs  Therefore  a breakthrough in thin film perovskite LEDs with blue emission is an urgent target in this field  As blue emissions are generally considered to be in the range of ~450–500 nm  from deep blue to sky blue  in perovskite thin film emitters  there are typically two approaches that can achieve emission in this range : dimensional engineering and composition engineering  In terms of dimensional engineering  a hypsochromic shift of emission can be obtained by quantum confinement effect when reducing the dimension of perovskite from three dimensions to two dimensions  Generally  the blue photoluminescence ( PL ) and electroluminescence ( EL ) of perovskite thin films and LEDs can be achieved by forming quasi-two-dimensional ( quasi-2D ) perovskite from a three-dimensional ( 3D ) bulk perovskite  In our previous work  we incorporated a small molecule of 2-phenoxyethylamine into CH3NH3PbBr3 to form 2D perovskite to blue shift the EL from 532 to 494 nm and 462 nm to achieve the sky-blue and deep-blue perovskite LEDs  respectively19  A similar strategy was applied by using ethylammonium bromide as the ligand to form 2D perovskite thin films  which yielded a decent EQE of 26 % with EL peaks of 473 and 485 nm20  To the best of our knowledge  this performance is the leading result among all of the published data  However  the relatively poor thermal stability and ion migration problems existing in organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite are detrimental to device stability  particularly in blue perovskite LEDs  which require a higher working voltage and hence stronger electric field for operation2122  Therefore  a much more stable perovskite system is required for blue perovskite LEDs  Among the perovskite family  an all-inorganic perovskite system obtains much better structural and thermal stability than an organic–inorganic hybrid system2324  Hence  it is possible to achieve a more stable blue perovskite LED by forming a quasi-2D perovskite from a green-emissive all-inorganic 3D perovskite of CsPbBr3  According to the previous reports and our own case ( Supplementary Figure 1a )  the formation of quasi-2D perovskite could indeed blue shift the PL from the green to blue region by the quantum confinement effect1925  Unfortunately  in the case of perovskite LEDs based on these quasi-2D perovskite films  all the high energy blue emissions diminished and only the green-emissive EL was detected ( Supplementary Figure 1b )  and similar phenomenon was also observed in other report25  We attribute this phenomenon to the highly efficient energy transfer and/or charge transfer from larger bandgap perovskite to the smallest bandgap perovskite in such an all-inorganic quasi-2D perovskite system  as has also been observed in other reports and was used as a key strategy to improve the emission property of small bandgap perovskites2627  The failure in achieving blue perovskite LED by forming quasi-2D perovskite based on a CsPbBr3 system prompts us to enlarge the bandgap of the 3D component in quasi-2D perovskite films to obtain a blue EL regardless of the presence of highly efficient energy transfer and/or charge transfer from the 2D to 3D component  Composition engineering on halide anions is a proven strategy to tune the bandgap of 3D perovskite  It is well-known that partially replacing Br with Cl in an AMBr3 perovskite system ( where A represents monovalent cations and M represents metal cations ) can enlarge the bandgap of perovskite and hence blue shift its emission from green to blue28  Here we show the perovskite of CsPbCl09Br21 with emission at 484 nm in the blue region through composition engineering by incorporating Cl into CsPbBr3 lattice  Based on such a 3D perovskite system  phenylethylammonium bromide ( PEABr ) is subsequently introduced into the CsPbCl09Br21 perovskite to form a quasi-2D perovskite thin film  We find that the PEABr can efficiently passivate the traps in perovskite thin films and dramatically improve their PLQYs from 015 % to a maximum of 27 %  Moreover  we observe a vertically non-uniform distribution of perovskite crystals in the Poly ( 34-ethylenedioxythiophene ) : poly ( styrene sulfonate ) ( PEDOT : PSS ) /perovskite hybrid film in which the majority of perovskite crystals disperse at the top of the film  On the basis of the recombination zone control in this hybrid layer  we activate most of the perovskite emitters and thus successfully demonstrate a highly efficient blue perovskite LED with maximum EQE of 57 % and maximum luminance of 3780 cd m−2  which  to our best knowledge  is a record performance for perovskite LEDs with blue emission  Results Optical properties of composition-engineered perovskites Typically  all inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite  which emits green light  is composed of cesium bromide ( CsBr ) and lead bromide ( PbBr2 )  As previously mentioned  the incorporation of Cl into the CsPbBr3 lattice makes possible the shift in emission from green to blue  However  the extremely poor solubility of CsPbCl3 ( which is composed of cesium chloride ( CsCl ) and PbCl2 ) in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) limits the Cl concentration in the CsPbClxBr3− x precursor solution and hence limits the degree of hypsochromic shift of emission  Compared to PbCl2  CsCl has a better solubility in DMSO  which can be applied as one of the precursor materials for CsPbClxBr3 − x to enhance its Cl concentration  Therefore  CsCl  CsBr  and PbBr2 are used to form CsPbClxBr3 − x in our case  We studied the different molar ratios between CsCl and CsBr and the total molar ratio between ( CsCl + CsBr ) and PbBr2 is fixed to a 1:1 ratio in CsPbClxBr3 − x precursor solution  According to Fig  1  as we increased the Cl concentration in CsPbClxBr3 − x by carefully increasing the amount of CsCl  a gradual hypsochromic shift of absorption edges from green to blue was observed  illustrating that we could precisely modulate the emission color for CsPbClxBr3 − x perovskite  When the ratio of CsCl to CsBr reached 9:1  the absorption peak of CsPbCl09Br21 perovskite appeared at 478 nm in the blue region  However  when we further increased the ratio to 1:0  precipitation occurred in the precursor solution ( Supplementary Figure 2 )  suggesting that the precursor solution reached a solubility limit and became unsuitable for further processing into thin films  According to Fig  1b  a similar trend was also observed in the PL spectra  When we increased the Cl concentration in the CsPbClxBr3 − x lattice  a gradual hypsochromic shift of emission was obtained  and the bluest emission  which was achieved by the CsPbCl09Br21 perovskite  was located at the wavelength of 484 nm in the blue region  Therefore  the composition of CsPbCl09Br21 was selected as the 3D perovskite system for our subsequent study aiming to realize the target of an efficient blue perovskite LED  Fig  1 figure 1 Composition engineering for efficient

intensity of their corresponding excitonic absorption peaks  b Photoluminescence ( PL ) spectra of CsPbClxBr3 − x thin films with different molar ratios of CsCl to CsBr  c Trap densities and photoluminescence quantum yields ( PLQYs ) of CsPbCl09Br21 thin films with different ratios of phenylethylammonium bromide ( PEABr )  The trap density was calculated based on the equation Nt = 2ε0εrVTFL/ ( qL2 )  and a detailed discussion can be found in Supplementary Figures 3 and 4 d PL spectra of CsPbCl09Br21 thin films with different ratios of PEABr Full size image In metal halide perovskites  trap-assisted recombination  which relates to trap density in perovskite thin films  is a typically non-radiative recombination2  According to Fig  1c  the trap density in a pristine CsPbCl09Br21 perovskite thin film is around 41 × 1017 cm−3  causing a low PLQY of around 015 %  Noticing that the charge-carrier density in a working LED is generally of the order of < 1016 cm−3  it can be expected that such high trap density in pristine CsPbCl09Br21 perovskite thin film will probably lead to inferior performance of the corresponding LED device29  Therefore  the suppression of trap-assisted recombination by reducing the trap density is critical to achieving a higher PLQY and better device performance  Recent reports prove that 2D perovskite obtains a much lower trap density compared with its 3D counterpart because the organic ligands ( such as 2­phenoxyethylamine and butylammonium ) generally passivate surface traps of perovskite1930  With this inspiration  we used PEABr to form 2D perovskite and passivated its surface traps based on the CsPbCl09Br21 system  Encouragingly  the trap density of perovskite thin films indeed dramatically reduced from ~41 × 1017 to 30 × 1016 cm−3 as the ratio of PEABr was increased from 0 to 100 % ( Supplementary Figures 3 and 4 )  However  a further increase in PEABr concentration to 120 % resulted in an increase of trap density to around 12 × 1017 cm−3  This result was attributed to the reduced crystal quality in perovskite films ( which will be discussed later )  In addition  we performed PL lifetime measurement to cross-check the trap passivation effect  The PL lifetimes of perovskite films increased as the increase of PEABr ratios ( Supplementary Figure 5 )  which suggested that the surface trap states of perovskite had been well passivated by the PEABr molecules  Furthermore  from Fig  1c  we can observe that the PLQY is increased with reducing the trap density of the perovskite film  The PLQYs of the perovskite thin films dramatically increase from 015 to 27 % with the increase of PEABr ratios from 0 to 100 %  and it decreases again to 189 % when an overload of 120 % PEABr was added into the CsPbCl09Br21 system  The relationship between trap densities and PLQYs of perovskite thin films shows that trap-assisted recombination dominates the non-radiative recombination  and trap reduction in such mixed-halide perovskites is critical to achieving efficient blue emission  We also recorded the PL spectra of CsPbCl09Br21 thin films with different ratios of PEABr to reveal their emission colors  Interestingly  as the PEABr ratio increased  the emission peaks gradually blue shifted  and several specific peaks appeared in the deep-blue region  Similar to the CsPbBr3 system discussed previously  the presence of excitonic emission peaks at 393  418  444  and 457 nm reflected the formation of 2D PEA2Csn − 1Pbn ( ClxBr1 − x ) 3n + 1 perovskite ( corresponding to n = 1  2  3  and 4  respectively )  Therefore  2D perovskites with n = 1  2  and 3 coexisted in CsPbCl09Br21 thin films with 40 % PEABr  while the CsPbCl09Br21 thin films with 60 %  80 %  100 %  and 120 % PEABr contained 2D perovskites with n values of 1  2  3  and 4  In addition  the resultant films are quasi-2D perovskite films composed of mixture of both 2D and 3D phases as indicated by the coexistence of characteristic emission at lower energy from the 3D component  Nanostructure and morphology of perovskite thin films To further confirm the coexistence of 2D and 3D perovskites in the film  we used X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) measurement to study the structural property of the perovskite films  According to Fig  2a  in pristine CsPbCl09Br21 thin film  a main peak at 2θ of 154° appeared  corresponding to the ( 100 ) plane of 3D perovskite  When we added 40 % PEABr into CsPbCl09Br21 thin films  a specific peak at 2θ of 53° appeared  reflecting the formation of n = 1 2D perovskite31  When we further increased the PEABr ratio to over 60 %  another specific peak at 2θ of 39° appeared  and we accordingly assigned it to the n = 2 2D perovskite  According to previous report that when PEABr was used as the organic spacer to form 2D perovskite based on CsxMA1 − xPbBr3 system  the n = 1 2D perovskite obtained the lowest formation_energy than that in the 2D perovskites with higher n  which might explain the formation of n = 1 2D perovskite even though the PEABr ratio was low32  In addition  although we dramatically increased the PEABr ratio from 0 to 120 %  the XRD pattern from 3D perovskite was always present  also suggesting that the film we obtained was a quasi-2D perovskite film that combined with 2D and 3D perovskites  It is noteworthy that based on PL measurement  several specific emission peaks from different types of 2D perovskite ( n = 1  2  3  and 4 ) appeared  whereas only n = 1 and/or n = 2 perovskites were detected in the XRD measurements  We attributed this mismatch to two possible reasons : first  the orientations of 2D perovskite crystals with higher n value are not in out-of-plane direction  which become undetectable in the one-dimensional XRD measurement ; second  the non-periodic alignment of these 2D perovskite crystals with higher n value caused the absence of Bragg diffraction and hence the absence of an XRD signal33  Fig  2 figure 2

microscope ( SEM ) images at a size of 1 × 1 μm2 Full size image The morphology of perovskite thin films is another important factor governing the final performance of perovskite LEDs  Therefore  we used a scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) to characterize the morphology of perovskite thin films with different ratios of PEABr  Figure 2b shows that the pristine CsPbCl09Br21 film has a poor morphology with a large number of pinholes  However  after the introduction of PEABr  perovskite films with better morphology and coverage were obtained  As the PEABr ratio increased from 40 to 100 %  the perovskite crystal became more and more regular in shape  suggesting improved crystal quality of the perovskite thin film  Particularly in the 100 % PEABr case  a perovskite film with isolated and regular perovskite small crystals was obtained  reflecting the formation of a high-quality perovskite film that correlated well with its low trap density and high PLQY  However  when we further increased the PEABr ratio to 120 %  the perovskite crystal returned to an irregular shape  resulting in a perovskite film with poorer crystal quality  It is likely that too much PEABr suppressed the formation of perovskite crystals  with a similar phenomenon also being observed when perovskite was mixed with other amine-containing materials1634  Device structure and performance To evaluate the EL properties of CsPbCl09Br21 thin films with different ratios of PEABr  we fabricated perovskite LEDs based on the device architecture of indium tin oxide ( ITO ) /PEDOT : PSS/perovskite/1  3  5-tris ( N-phenylbenzimiazole-2-yl ) benzene ( TPBi ) /lithium fluoride ( LiF ) /Al  as shown in Fig  3a  Here  PEDOT : PSS ( CH 8000  45 nm thick ) with a deep work function of −515 eV was used as the hole injection layer35  The valance band of perovskite was confirmed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy ( UPS ) as shown ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) and the energy diagram of the whole device is presented in Fig  3a  We also summarize the device performance in Fig  3b  c and Table 1  In the pristine CsPbCl09Br21 perovskite LED  an inferior EQE of only 005 % was achieved  When we increased the PEABr ratio in CsPbCl09Br21 perovskite thin films from 0 to 100 %  the device performance improved dramatically  and the best device reached a high EQE of 36 %  However  further increasing the PEABr ratio to 120 % reduced the EQE and luminance  There are three potential reasons for these results  First  the trend of EQE change with increasing PEABr ratios is similar to that of PLQYs of perovskite films  suggesting that the EL property of perovskite LEDs is governed by the PL property of the corresponding perovskite thin films  Second  the EL property also strongly related to the trap densities of perovskite films as higher trap density could result in more severe trapping of injected charge carriers and hence cause a more severe non-radiative trap-assisted recombination  Third  the pristine perovskite thin film suffered from poor morphology due to the large number of pinholes that caused a severe leakage current in the LED device  while better film coverage and crystal quality were obtained after the introduction of PEABr from 0 to 100 %  which also resulted in the suppression of leakage current in perovskite LEDs according to Fig  3b  However  a further increase in the PEABr concentration to 120 % led to a film with decreased crystal quality compared with the 100 % PEABr case  causing a slightly drop in device performance  Fig  3 figure 3 Performance of CsPbCl09Br21

ratios of PEABr and all the EL emissions obtained narrow full-widths at half-maximum ( FWHMs ) of < 25 nm  resulting in the high color purity in Commission Internationale de l ’ Eclairage ( CIE ) coordinate as shown in Fig  3e  Similar to the CsPbBr3 system  although excitonic PL from 2D PEA2Csn − 1Pbn ( ClxBr1 − x ) 3n + 1 perovskites was observed  only one single EL peak at the lowest energy belonging to the 3D perovskite was detected in all cases  suggesting that energy transfer and/or charge transfer from higher-energy 2D perovskite to lower-energy 3D perovskite is also highly efficient in such a quasi-2D system  In addition  a gradual blue shift of EL from 487 to 478 nm was observed as the PEABr ratio increased  which correlated well with the blue shift of PL spectra because of the gradual loss of the 3D nature of the perovskite film  With the blue shift of EL spectra  the corresponding CIE value also changed from the sky blue to blue region  suggesting the successful achievement of a blue-emissive perovskite LED  Modulation of recombination zone position Recently  several reports have shown that a vertically non-uniform distribution of perovskite nanostructure exists in quasi-2D perovskite thin films  Wang et al36 reported a vertical element distribution in the perovskite multi-quantum wells in which the Pb signal gradually decreased from the top to the bottom of the perovskite thin film  suggesting that the 3D perovskite was mainly located at the top of the perovskite film  whereas the 2D perovskite was enriched at the bottom  In addition  Shang et al25 reported that only the PL from 3D perovskite could be detected under photoexcitation from the top side  whereas PL from the 2D perovskite appeared with photoexcitation from the bottom side  indirectly reflecting the vertical distribution of the perovskite nanostructure  According to these previous studies  it can be expected that the position of the recombination zone for the injected charge carriers is critical to achieving a highly efficient perovskite LED if a vertically non-uniform distribution of nanostructure is existed in the perovskite thin film  Therefore  we used a scanning transmission electron microscope to study the vertical morphology of the perovskite thin film to reveal the distribution of the perovskite  According to Fig  4a  we obtained a PEDOT : PSS/perovskite hybrid film without a distinct interface  although both the PEDOT : PSS and perovskite films were deposited layer by layer  The majority of perovskite crystals dispersed at the top of the hybrid film  whereas some crystals were embedded within the PEDOT : PSS layer  leaving a perovskite capping layer above the PEDOT : PSS film and resulting in a vertically non-uniform distribution of the perovskite crystals  We attributed this result to the rough PEDOT : PSS films regardless of the film thickness ( Supplementary Figure 7 )  which allowed a few perovskite crystals filling into the voids and being embedded by the PEDOT : PSS layer  Fig  4 figure 4 Vertical morphology of the perovskite thin film and schematic diagram of the modulation of recombination zone position  a

perovskite crystals disperse at the top of the film  if the injected electrons and holes can recombine in Zone A  a strong blue emission can be obtained ; however  if the injected electrons and holes can only recombine in Zone B  the film shows a weak blue emission Full size image In addition  we also used an energy-dispersive spectrometer ( EDS ) to further unveil the elemental distribution of perovskite crystals  Figure 4a shows the distribution of the Cs  Pb  Br  and Cl signals and their integrated signals as a function of depth  It is obvious to find that most of the elements present at the top of the film  showing a similar distribution without distinct compositional difference  In addition  the integrated Cs  Pb  Br  and Cl signals perfectly overlap with each other as a function of depth  illustrating that all of the perovskite crystals ( from top to bottom ) are in a similar stoichiometric ratio  This result provides strong evidence that every single perovskite crystal has a similar quasi-2D structure and that no obvious nanostructural distribution occurred in our case  which is different from that observed in previously mentioned reports2536  Therefore  each perovskite crystal is a single emitter and by combining the EL spectra of the CsPbCl09Br21 perovskite LEDs with different ratios of PEABr  we can conclude that in a working perovskite LED  highly efficient energy transfer and/or charge transfer occurs within those single quasi-2D perovskite crystals  as illustrated in the top schematic diagram in Fig  4b  In addition  the observation of vertically non-uniform distribution of the perovskite crystals encouraged us to further modulate the position of the recombination zone in the device aiming to produce a more efficient perovskite LED  The recombination zone is the region in which injected electrons and holes meet and recombine with each other  For LED applications  we expect that the recombination zone should be located at the emissive layer to convert electrical energy into light  In addition  the recombination zone width is also a critical parameter  and it is calculated to be ca  55 nm in our best perovskite LED ( Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Figure 8 )  As previously mentioned  the majority of emissive perovskite crystals dispersed on the top of the perovskite film ( assigned Zone A in Fig  4b )  while a small number of perovskite crystals dispersed at the bottom of the perovskite film ( assigned Zone B in Fig  4b )  Therefore  it should be much better for the injected electrons and holes to recombine in Zone A rather than in Zone B to activate the greatest number of perovskite crystals to realize a strong blue emission  as illustrated in the bottom schematic diagram of Fig  4b  Generally  the position of the recombination zone in the emissive layer can be simply controlled by the thickness of the hole and electron injection layers373839  Considering perovskite LED is typically a hole-dominant device when using PEDOT : PSS and TPBi as the hole and electron injection layer  respectively  we focused our study on the thickness control of the PEDOT : PSS layer to obtain an optimized position of the recombination zone35  We tuned the thickness of the PEDOT : PSS layer from 15 to 60 nm in the CsPbCl09Br21 perovskite LEDs with 100 % PEABr  which has shown the best EQE in our study  According to Fig  5a  b and Table 2  when the PEDOT : PSS layer was thick ( 60 nm )  a relatively poor EQE of 26 % was obtained in the perovskite LED because in a thick PEDOT : PSS case  the injected holes should take a relatively long time to pass through the thick PEDOT : PSS layer and subsequently inject into the valence band of perovskite  which results in a recombination zone position closer to Zone B  When we decreased the film thickness from 60 to 45 nm and 30 nm  the EQE of the perovskite LEDs increased dramatically from 26 % to 36 % and 57 %  respectively  In such a case  the thinner PEDOT : PSS layer allowed the injected holes to pass through in a shorter time  resulting in a position shift of the recombination zone toward Zone A  which the electrons can reach in a short time  As the position of the recombination zone gradually shifted from Zone B to Zone A as the PEDOT : PSS thickness decreased  more and more perovskite crystals were activated  leading to an increase in device performance  However  when we further decreased the PEDOT : PSS thickness to 15 nm  the perovskite LED showed a relatively poor EQE of 22 %  This result can be attributed to the poor coverage of such an ultra-thin PEDOT : PSS film on ITO  which may allow the perovskite crystals to directly get contact with the bottom electrode and therefore led to a severe leakage current in the perovskite LED ( as shown in Fig  5a ) that degraded device performance  It is worth emphasizing that based on recombination zone modulation  our best blue perovskite LED achieved a record luminance of 3780 cd m−2 and a record EQE of 57 %  which is more than twice that of the currently published data on blue perovskite LEDs  as shown in Fig  5d1019202832404142434445464748495051  Our devices also obtained excellent device reproducibility with average EQE of 45 % ( Supplementary Figure 9 )  Fig  5 figure 5 Performance of perovskite light-emitting diode ( LEDs ) ( 100 %

Full size image Table 2 Performance of perovskite LEDs ( 100 % PEABr case ) with different PEDOT : PSS thicknesses Full size table In addition  our devices presented decent spectrum stability with no shift of the EL spectrum observed when we increased the applied voltage of the LED from 36 to 56 V ( Supplementary Figure 10a )  However  when we further increased the applied voltage exceeding 6 V  the EQE and luminance of the device started to drop  and the EL spectrum also red shifted slightly by around 8 nm  which could be attributed to the phase separation within the perovskite film due to the migration of Cl− and Br−40  Moreover  the operating lifetime of the devices were also studied under a constant applied voltage of 44 V  as shown in Fig  5c  Our device obtained a half lifetime of around 10 min  which is one of the best results among the reported lifetimes of blue-emitting perovskite LEDs  as summarized in Supplementary Table 1  In addition  the EL spectrum of the device was tracked during the operation  As shown in Supplementary Figure 10b  the initial emission peak was located at 480 nm and no spectrum shift was observed at the initial 1 min  followed by a slight red shift of 3 nm in the next 3 min  During the operating time from 3 to 9 min  the emission peak continuously shifted from 483 to 488 nm and eventually pined at 488 nm for the rest of testing time  We attributed this slight red shift of spectrum to the possible phase separation occurred in the mixed-halide perovskite system  It is worth noting that other degradation processes may also occur  which requires a further investigation in the future to fully unveil the degradation mechanism  Discussion Here  we demonstrate a highly efficient blue perovskite LED by combining the strategies of composition engineering in quasi-2D perovskite crystals and modulation of the recombination zone position  In terms of composition engineering  CsCl  CsBr  and PbBr2 are used to prepare the precursor solution  and the molar ratio of CsCl : CsBr : PbBr2 of 9:1:10 is used to form the blue-emissive 3D perovskite ( CsPbCl09Br21 ) without solubility problem  Subsequently  PEABr is introduced into the CsPbCl09Br21 perovskite to passivate the trap states and form quasi-2D perovskite  which helps to obtain a blue-emissive quasi-2D perovskite thin film with PLQY up to 27 %  Moreover  we observe a vertically non-uniform distribution of quasi-2D perovskite crystals in the PEDOT : PSS/perovskite hybrid film in which the majority of perovskite crystals disperse on top of the film and only a few are embedded within the PEDOT : PSS layer  Therefore  we modulate the position of the recombination zone to the top of the perovskite film by simply controlling the thickness of the PEDOT : PSS layer to allow the majority of charges recombine in the perovskite emitters  With this strategy  we successfully demonstrate an efficient blue perovskite LED with record EQE of 57 % and luminance of 3780 cd m−2  The EL peak is located at 480 nm with FWHM of 21 nm  Our study shows that it is possible to further improve the performance of blue perovskite LEDs by carefully engineering the composition and dimension of the perovskite crystals  as well as the recombination zone position in the devices  paving the way for realization of full-color displays and white-light illumination with perovskite LEDs  However  the lifetimes of our devices are still far from that of commercial LEDs  and it is one of the tough issues has to be solved in perovskite LED field  Our finding indicates that phase separation is probably the main issue causing the device degradation in a mixed-halide perovskite system  Therefore  a pure-halide perovskite system with pure blue and red emission may be ultimately needed for stable perovskite LEDs  In addition  heat produced by the injected current and photon reabsorption may also cause a thermal stability issue ( change of film morphology or degradation of perovskite component  etc )  In such case  an efficient device structure design with excellent heat radiation and light out coupling needs to be developed  Moreover  considering the ionic nature of perovskite crystals  the strong electric field in a thin film perovskite LED also could be another possible factor for device degradation  and this would be more severe for a blue perovskite LED as which needs higher applied voltage for operation  The real degradation mechanism of perovskite LEDs is still unclear in this field  and it is of great necessity for an intelligent design for stable perovskite LEDs  Methods Materials and chemicals CsBr ( 99999 % )  CsCl ( 99999 % )  and PbBr2 ( 99999 % ) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich  PEABr ( 995 % ) was purchased from Xi ’ an Polymer Light

Exsolution on Perovskite Oxides : Insights into Mechanism  Characteristics and Novel Strategies Article Open access 28 November 2023 1 Introduction Oxides with a perovskite ABO3 structure  where A is a rare earth element and B is a transition metal  have been investigated for years as materials for various uses [ 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536 ]  They show very good catalytic properties and are less expensive than noble metals  and they can be used as catalysts to oxidize hydrocarbons and carbon oxide  and as three-way catalysts ( TWC ) [ 12345678910111213141516171819202122 ]  Perovskites LaFeO3 [ 12 ] and LaMn09Co01O3 [ 23 ] show good properties  which are further improved by introducing Ag into the perovskite  for the oxidation of carbon black  R1−xAxMnO3 perovskite manganites ( where R is a rare earth cation and A is a doping cation ) exhibit great magnetoresistance and the magnetocaloric effect [ 24 ]  Since mixed ( electron and ionic ) conduction occurs in the LaFeO3 perovskite  the latter can be used in solid oxide fuel cells [ 25 ]  ABO3 perovskites  with La in position A and metal B as Mn  Co  Fe or Cr  show good catalytic properties in oxidation processes [ 6789101112  35  36 ]  The activity of perovskites in methane oxidation decreases in the order : LaCoO3 > LaMnO3  LaFeO3 > LaCrO3 [ 9 ]  Their catalytic activity is determined mainly by oxygen mobility  the redox properties of the transition metals and the perovskite structure  As catalysts  one can also use perovskites in which the cation in position A and/or B is partially substituted with a different valency cation  In such cases  the activity of the catalysts for oxidation reactions is enhanced  When the cation in position A is substituted with a different valency cation  the oxidation number of the cation in position B changes and defects arise in the perovskite ’ s structure [ 123456  13141516171819202122 ]  As a result of a cation deficit  an oxygen deficit or an oxygen excess in position A or B non-stoichiometry may arise in the perovskite [ 4  5  24  25 ]  Oxygen vacancies are more common than cation vacancies in the perovskite ’ s structure [ 23 ]  A considerable increase in the catalytic activity of LaFeO3  LaFe05Co05O3 [ 2 ]  LaNiO3  LaCoO3 [ 1  5 ] and LaMnO3 [ 1  14  15  21 ] perovskites was achieved by partially replacing La+3 in them with an Ag+1 cation  However  there is no agreement between researchers as to the amount of silver which can be incorporated into the crystal lattice of perovskites  This may be due to the large number of different synthesis methods  co-precipitation [ 1  2  15  21  30  31 ]  citrate-gel [ 3  4  23 ]  sol–gel [ 5  27  29 ]  such as solid-state reaction [ 262728 ]  flame pyrolysis [ 5 ]  polyol [ 32 ]  hydrothermal [ 33 ]  combustion [ 24  25  34 ]  spray decomposition [ 21 ] and microemulsion methods [ 35 ]  used in the investigations  Hien et al  [ 27 ] and Ye et al  [ 28 ] found that using various methods to synthesize La1−xAgxMnO3+δ perovskite  a single perovskite phase is obtained at x < 02  Whereas at x > 02 other phases  mainly Ag-metallic ones  also form  Ehi-Eromosele et al  [ 24 ] maintain that when this perovskite was synthesized using the solid-state or sol–gel method  Ag0 was detected apart from the perovskite regardless of the amount of silver introduced  When hydrothermal synthesis was used at x > 004  Ag2O3 was found in addition to the perovskite [ 24 ]  In the case of La1−xAgxMn09Co01O3 prepared using the citrate method  an Ag2O phase  the amount of which increased with the Ag content in the perovskite  was observed [ 23 ]  A single phase of La08Ag015MnO3 perovskite was obtained using rapid solution combustion synthesis and oxalyl dihydrazine as the fuel [ 24 ]  A single phase of La09Ag01Mn09Co01O3 perovskite was obtained using the citrate method [ 4 ]  The research to date has shown that the solubility of silver in perovskites is low  This paper presents the physicochemical properties and methane and hexane oxidation activity of monolithic catalysts containing 122–129 % LaFeO3 perovskite in which some of the lanthanum was substituted with silver to give La1−xAgxFeO3  x = 0–025  The physicochemical properties of the perovskites were determined using the following methods : X-ray diffraction ( XRD )  scanning and transmission electron microscopy ( SEM  TEM )  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS )  BET specific surface area measurement  H2 temperature programmed reduction ( TPR-H2 ) and O2 temperature programmed desorption ( O2-TPD )  The effect of the silver content of the perovskite on the homogeneity of its structure and on the activity and operational stability of the catalysts containing the perovskites was examined  In the literature to date  there are no test results for monolithic catalysts on metallic support containing La1−xAgxFeO3  x = 0–025 perovskite with a silver addition  When a monolithic catalyst is used  the gas flow resistance and pressure drop on the catalyst bed decrease  Moreover  thanks to better contact between the gas and the catalyst ’ s active surface than with granular catalysts  the volume of the catalytic converter can be reduced [ 37 ]  The catalysts investigated can prove effective in removing hydrocarbons from exhaust gases and  thus  protecting the environment  2 Methods and Materials 21 Catalyst Preparation The supports for the monolithic catalysts were made of 005 mm thick heat-resistant FeCr20Al5 foil  They were shaped as 70 mm high and 26 mm diameter cylinders  with a honeycomb cross section with triangular channels  The supports were etched in 10 wt % sulfuric acid at 60 °C for 15 min  washed in distilled water and dried at 150 °C  As a result of this treatment  the specific surface area of the support increased  A washcoat containing Al2O3 with a 012 % addition of La2O3 was deposited on the prepared supports  The sol was obtained by thoroughly mixing 38 wt % Al ( OH ) 3  016 wt % La ( NO3 ) 3·6H2O  25 wt % glycerine and water  A few drops of ammonium hydroxide were added to the sol to obtain a gel  The washcoat was deposited on the monolithic supports by immersing them in the gel  drying them at 150 °C and then calcining at 400 °C for 3 h Oxides having a perovskite structure and the nominal composition La1−xAgxFeO3x = 005–025  were used as the active components  The perovskites were obtained by dissolving appropriate amounts of the precursors  La ( NO3 ) 3·6H2O ( Fluka )  Fe ( NO3 ) 3·9Η2Ο ( POCH ) and AgNO3 ( POCH )  in 150 cm3 of distilled water  The obtained solution was evaporated to dryness at a temperature of 130 °C  pulverized and calcined at 750 °C for 65 h The reaction took place in the solid phase with the liberation of NO2 and O2 gases and the formation of solid La1−x AgxFeO3 perovskites  The general equation for the production of La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites can be proposed as follows : ( 1 ) where : s solid  g gas  Obtained perovskite was ground in a mortar to obtain grains less than 010 mm in diameter  The perovskites were mixed with 06 g/cm3 citric acid solution  obtaining a slurry in which the support was then immersed  The resulting catalysts were calcined at 500 °C for 3 h The catalysts contained 122–129 wt % of the perovskite relative to the weight of the support after etching  In the same way catalysts with the perovskite but with no silver addition  containing 159 wt % and 109 wt % of LaFeO3 were made  22 Structure Characterization of the Catalysts The crystalline and phase identification of the prepared LaFeO3 perovskites was determined by X-ray powder diffraction ( XRD ) using PANanalytical X ’ Pert PRO diffractometer with Cuα radiation ( λ = 015406 nm )  Data were recorded in the 10°–80° 2θ range with an angular step of 0017° and a counting time of 026 s per step  Diffraction peaks of crystalline phases were compared with those of standard compounds reported in the JCPDS Data File  The textural properties of the prepared LaFeO3 perovskites calcined at different temperatures were obtained from nitrogen physisorption measurements at − 196 °C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus  The samples ( ~ 08 g ) were degassed in vacuum at 300 °C for 4 h prior to the measurement  The specific surface area ( SBET ) was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller ( BET ) method and the total pore volume ( Vp ) was determined at a relative pressure of P/Po = 098  The morphological and structural characterization of the LaFeO3 perovskite was additionally performed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy ( HRTEM ) using a Philips CM 20 microscope operated at 200 kV and provided 025 nm resolution  The analysis of the presented phases was made based on the fast Fourier transforms ( FFT ) obtained for the recorded pictures  The distance of the spots and angles between of them were checked with the database using the Process Diffraction program  The morphology of the catalysts was examined using FEI Quanta 250 scanning electron microscope in a secondary electron ( SE ) and back scattered electron ( BSE ) imaging mode  operating at 15 kV under 10−5 Pa pressure  Before SEM examination the samples were sputter coated with a thin layer ( ~ 15 nm ) of carbon  Temperature-programmed reduction ( TPR )  and O2-temperature-programmed desorption ( O2-TPD-MS ) were carried out using a Micromeritics apparatus model Autochem II 2920 with a thermal conductivity detector ( TCD )  The composition of the outlet gas was continuously monitored by means of a quadrupole mass spectrometer ( OmniStar QMS-200 from Pfeiffer Vacuum )  The catalyst ( 02 g ) was loaded in a quartz reactor  and prior to every TPD or TPR run was heated ( 10 °C/min ) up to 750 °C in flowing synthetic air  TPD-MS of pre-adsorbed oxygen was carried out in He as carrier gas ( 30 cm3/min )  after a saturation of the sample in 20 cm3/min of oxygen at 750 °C  followed by cooling down to 50 °C  The following temperature program was adopted : the catalyst was kept at 50 °C for 10 min  the temperature was then raised ( 10 °C/min ) to 900 °C  In TPR analysis  a 5 % H2/Ar ( 30 cm3/min ) stream was passed through the sample and the temperature was raised from 20 to 1000 °C with a ramp of 10 °C/min  XRD measurements were performed at the end of the TPR-H2 run  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) measurements were performed using a SPECS PHOIBOS 100 spectrometer and Mg anode ( 12536 eV ) operating at 250 W for high resolution spectra  Before the analysis the surface was cleaned by Ar+ sputtering with a low energy beam ( 2 keV  4 μA/cm2  60 s )  The spectra were processed and fitted by the SPECLAB and CasaXPS software using the Gaussian–Lorentzian curve profile and the Shirley baseline  The accuracy of the reported binding energies was ± 01 eV  The C 1s peak at 2848 eV  representing carbon contamination  was used as the reference for all the spectra  23 Catalytic Activity Measurements The catalytic activity in the complete oxidation of methane and n-hexane was tested in a quartz flow reactor placed in a electrical furnace with a controlled temperature rise  The reaction temperature was measured by a Cr-NiCr thermocouple placed in a monolith channel at the height of 16 mm from the gas outlet  1 % of methane was oxidized in air in the 400–700 °C range  The total gas hourly space velocity ( GHSV ) for methane oxidation amounted to 5800 h−1 ( based on the total monolith volume )  Also the activity of the catalysts in the oxidation of 1500 ppm of n-hexane in air in the 270–560 °C range and at the GHSV of 8900 h−1 was tested  Measurements were taken for each catalyst two times  and the measurement error was about ± 1 % of methane conversion measured  The methane and carbon dioxide concentrations before and after the oxidation reaction were measured using a DP-27 analyser made by Nanosens  The analyser can measure CH4 concentrations in a range of 000–500 vol % and CO2 concentrations in a range of 000–1000 % vol  with an accuracy of ± 005  A MEXA-574GE analyser made by Horiba was used to measure n-hexane and carbon dioxide concentrations in hexane oxidation  The analyser measures hexane concentrations within a range of 000–10000 ppm  CO2 concentrations within a range of 000–2000 % vol  and CO concentrations within a range of 000–1000 vol %  The conversion of hydrocarbons over the tested catalysts was calculated from the methane and n-hexane concentrations measured before and after the reaction  3 Results and Discussion 31 Catalysts Characterization 311 Structural Characterization ( XRD  BET ) The presence of a LaFeO3 perovskite phase  characterized by the strongest reflection at 2θ of ~ 33° ( PDF card No  70-7777 )  was found in the XRD patterns of the prepared LaFeO3 ( Fig  1a ) and La1−xAgxFeO3x = 005–025 catalyst samples ( Fig  1b–f )  The diffractogram recorded for the La075Ag025FeO3 sample after heat-treatment for 50 h at 700 °C is also presented ( Fig  1g )  The long-term heating can be considered a simulation of the catalytic reaction conditions  The LaFeO3 material can be described with orthorhombic symmetry in the Pbnm space group  After incorporation of silver ions into the LaFeO3 perovskite  its crystal structure did not change  However  the prepared catalytic materials are not a single phase because the XRD patterns of all samples  aside from reflections coming from the LaFeO3 perovskite structure  exhibit lines which are characteristic for La ( OH ) 3 ( 2θ at 157°  273°  280°  395° and 486° ) ( PDF Card No  83-2034 ) with a hexagonal system and P63/m space group ( Fig  1a–f )  The intensity of these reflections is similar for the La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites with 005 ≤ x ≤ 02 ( Fig  1 )  Additionally  the XRD patterns of the La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites with x = 01–025 also exhibit peaks ascribed to metallic silver ( 2θ at 381°  446° and 646° ) ( PDF Card No  06-4997 ) and the intensity of these peaks increases with the rise of Ag in the perovskite  This proves the incomplete incorporation of the silver into the LaFeO3 perovskite crystal structure and the high silver segregation upon increasing the amount of Ag in the perovskite  However  according to Pecchi et al  [ 4 ]  due to the close proximity of the strongest diffraction lines of Ag0 and Ag2O ( PDF card No  12-793 )  it has been impossible to ascertain whether or not Ag2O is present in the perovskite samples studied  Metallic Ag is not visible only in the XRD pattern of the La095Ag005FeO3 perovskite ie  for the sample with the lowest Ag content  Therefore  due to the limited solubility of Ag in LaFeO3  diffraction peaks of La1−xAgxFeO3 are not shifted towards the lower 2θ angles in comparison to corresponding peaks of the LaFeO3 sample  Bellakki et al  [ 25 ] observed peak associated with AgO  which was not visible at lower Ag content  in the XRD pattern of La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites for x > 03 ( synthesized by the combustion process using glycine as a fuel )  This demonstrates better incorporation of Ag into the perovskite structure than in our perovskites  in which the Ag peak is already visible at x = 01  Fig  1 figure 1 XRD patterns recorded for LaFeO3 ( a )  La095Ag005FeO3 ( b )  La090Ag010FeO3 ( c )  La085Ag015FeO3 ( d )  La080Ag020FeO3 ( e ) and La075Ag025FeO3 ( f ) perovskites calcined at 750 °C for 65 h and for La075Ag025FeO3 after additional heat-treatment at 700 °C for 50 h ( g ) Full size image Heating La075Ag025FeO3 perovskite for 50 h in air at 700 °C does not substantially alter the perovskite structure  as can be seen in Fig  1g  However  the reflections from the Ag phase are characterized by a weaker intensity in comparison to that from a fresh sample ( Fig  1f )  The reason may be better silver incorporation into the LaFeO3 perovskite crystal structure in the catalysts during the long-term heating  The disappearance of the reflections from the La ( OH ) 3 structure can be also seen  which was expected  After such a long time of heating  the complete conversion of the lanthanum and iron compounds to LaFeO3 perovskite occurs  The average crystallite size of LaFeO3  La1−xAgxFeO3 and metallic Ag was calculated using the Scherrer formula and the results are shown in Table 1  For LaFeO3  the average crystallite size was 48 nm and for the Ag-substituted perovskites  it was 45–47 nm  The average crystallite size of metallic Ag  calculated from the line broadening of the Ag peak at 2θ = 381° ( the most intensive Ag peak partly overlapped with a weak perovskite peak ) amounted to 31  36  40 and 41 nm for the La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskite with x = 01  015  020 and 025  respectively  However  the Ag crystallite size calculated from the peak at 2θ = 446° ( not overlapped  but low peak intensity ) was much lower  30 nm  for the perovskite with x = 020 and 025  Table 1 Characterization data for prepared La1−xAgxFeO3x = 0–025 perovskite powders and catalysts Full size table HRTEM studies of the catalysts not doped with silver and calcined in air at 750 °C for 65 h  confirmed the presence of the LaFeO3 and La ( OH ) 3 phases in the sample  as was visible on the XRD diffractograms  Example pictures in Fig  S1 ( Supplementary material ) show crystallites with lattice fringes of about 032 nm and 028 nm distance  which fit those of the ( 120 ) and ( 200 ) LaFeO3 crystal planes  respectively  The fast Fourier transform ( FFT ) from this phase contains spots with a 55° angle between them  which corresponds to the values from the database for an orthorhombic perovskite structure  Analogical analysis revealed spots in the FFT at 033 nm and 039 nm with a 90° angle between them  which characterized the ( 110 ) and ( 001 ) La ( OH ) 3 crystal planes  respectively  Additionally  very small particles of Fe2O3 with lattice fringes of 037 nm and 027 nm distance ( 47° angle between spots in the FFT )  which fit the ( 012 ) and ( 104 ) crystallographic planes  were also visible  In some pictures  La2O3 crystallites exhibited as a 030 nm spot from ( 101 ) crystal plane were present in FFT ( Fig  S1 )  These small particles ( less than 5 nm ) could not be detected by XRD  These results clearly indicate that Fe2O3 and La2O3 did not completely react under the synthesis conditions used  The unreacted iron oxide is present in the sample in the form of very small particles dispersed on the perovskite crystallites  By contrast  most of the unreacted lanthanum oxide is transformed into La ( OH ) 3 after exposure to the wet air at room temperature  Generally  lanthanum oxide is known to be highly hygroscopic and powder samples of La2O3 rapidly convert to lanthanum hydroxide in wet air [ 38 ]  For this reason  we additionally prepared the fresh LaFeO3 and La075Ag025FeO3 samples by storing them in an He atmosphere before the XRD measurements  Next  the catalysts were exposed to air overnight at room temperature and the second XRD experiments were carried out  The XRD diffractograms obtained are presented in Fig  S2 ( Supplementary material )  Thus  it is clearly visible that the XRD profiles from fresh catalysts contain the reflections from La2O3 structure ( PDF card No  05-0602 )  while those from the samples after the exposure to wet air are characterized by reflections from the La ( OH ) 3 phase  Texture characteristics of the calcined perovskites were determined based on the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the results are listed in Table 1  Regardless of the amount of silver in the La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskite  their specific surface area is nearly the same  52–56 m2/g  They are slightly lower than the specific surface area of the unsubstituted LaFeO3 perovskite ( 76 m2/g )  However  the total pore volume significantly drops from 004 cm3/g to 0012–0015 cm3/g for the LaFeO3 and La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites  respectively  This may suggest incorporation of the silver into the pores of the LaFeO3 perovskite  312 SEM–EDX Measurements An SEM analysis revealed that  irrespective of the Ag content  the active layers of La1−xAgxFeO3/FeCr20Al5 catalysts were cracked and porous ( Fig  2 )  Increasing the silver content ( x ) in the La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskite from 010 to 025 did not result in any significant changes in the morphology of the catalysts ( Figs  2a–c )  whereas a distinct difference is observed on the fracture surfaces of the layers  The catalysts ’ active layers containing 010 and 015 mol of Ag ( Figs  2a and 2b ) have a fine-grained structure  as opposed to the layer containing 025 mol of Ag  which is less compact and composed of agglomerates a few hundred nm in size ( Fig  2c )  The surfaces of all the active layers are heterogeneous with randomly distributed light precipitations about 1 µm in size  These precipitations are particularly visible in the BSE mode ( Figs  2a–c )  which indicates that their chemical composition differs from the bulk catalyst composition  This is confirmed by the layer surface mapping results from the La075Ag025FeO3 perovskite with the highest Ag content ( Fig  3 )  Although no quantitative differences in the catalyst ’ s chemical composition within the analysed area can be seen in the recorded elemental maps  the latter clearly show that the small precipitations visible in Fig  2 are enriched with Ag  This hypothesis is supported by the distribution of Ag shown in Fig  3 and by the spectra for the whole surface of the sample and for those light precipitations included in this figure  One can clearly see that only silver is distributed nonuniformly  The other elements ( oxygen  lanthanum and iron ) are homogeneously distributed on the surface  Fig  2 figure 2

Maps showing the surface distribution of oxygen  iron  lanthanum and silver  recorded using EDXS for a catalyst containing La075Ag025FeO3 perovskite Full size image Figure 2d shows the surface of the La075Ag025FeO3 catalyst after 50 h of operation at 690–700 °C  As a result of catalyst heat-treatment for 50 h  the layer ’ s surface becomes more porous and the previously visible silver-enriched precipitations disappear  Therefore  one can suppose that the silver was redistributed during the 50 h of catalyst operation  and the microscale chemical composition became homogenous  313 TPR  TPD Measurements The reduction process of the La1−xAgxFeO3 catalysts with different silver loadings was investigated using a TPR technique  Figure 4 presents the TPR profiles of a standard LaFeO3 sample and of La1−xAgxFeO3 for x = 015  025 catalysts calcined at 750 °C  Fig  4 figure 4 TPR curves for LaFeO3 catalyst calcined at 750 °C ( a )  and La1−xAgxFeO3 catalysts with silver loading x : 015 ( b ) and 025 ( c ) ; insets show the expanded low-temperature region where reduction of isolated Ag+ occurs Full size image XRD and HRTEM data showed that after heat treatment at 750 °C  the samples showed a partially ordered orthorhombic LaFeO3 phase that was contaminated mainly by La2O3/La ( OH ) 3 and amorphous Fe2O3 phases  Table 2 shows the average Fe2O3 content calculated from TPR results of perovskite samples  Nevertheless  the presence of an amorphous Fe2O3 phase can not be easily recognized due to the limitations of the XRD technique  Table 2 Results of quantitative analysis on the TPR-H2 profiles of La1−xAgxFeO3x = 0  015  025 perovskites Full size table It has been reported that the very weak TPR profiles of pure LaFeO3 were affected by preparation method  and especially by the temperature of calcination  mainly due to phase impurities ( Fe2O3 ) [ 39 ]  As shown in Fig  4a  the reduction of LaFeO3 was a stepwise process in the 150–350 °C region  The first reduction peak of the perovskite sample ( about 200 °C ) was assigned to the removal of adsorbed oxygen species  and the peak at 320 °C was due to the reduction of Fe+4 to Fe+3  The TPR signal at high temperatures  > 750 °C  ( not completely detected  even up to 1000 °C )  can be attributed to the reduction of perovskite lattice oxygen and/or part of the Fe+3/Fe+2 to Fe0  These signals are equal for all samples  The quantitative hydrogen consumption is shown in Table 2  In Fig  4a  the main H2 consumption is in the 350–750 °C range and is related mainly to the reduction of the Fe2O3 phase ( see HRTEM Fig  S1 Supplementary material )  The reason for the formation of nanocrystalline Fe2O3 could be the short time of calcination ( 65 h ) or insufficient temperature ( 750 °C ) during the calcination process  It ’ s well known  that the TPR profile of Fe2O3 contains two composite peaks  According to the calculated area ratios of individual peaks at about 420 °C and the broad peak at 590 °C  which was about 1:8 for pristine Fe2O3 ( see Table 2 )  we assume the following three-step Fe2O3 reduction process : Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe  The XRD spectra collected after TPR experiments ( Fig  S3 Supplementary material ) up to 1000 °C revealed the presence of metallic iron ( α-Fe )  Perovskite was always present as the most abundant phase and this should testify to the reduction only of a fraction of Fe+3/Fe+2 ions in the B-sites of the perovskite  Moreover  in order to preserve the perovskite structure  a fraction of La ( Ag ) ions should also be expelled from the A-sites and  in fact  extra very active dispersed metallic silver nanoclusters are present out of the perovskite lattice  Additionally  Ag-Fe nano-alloys were found after the TPR run in perovskite samples containing Ag  In the low-temperature region ( 10–150 °C ) for La1−xAgxFeO3 samples  two very low peaks ( insets in Fig  4b  c ) of H2 consumption with a maximum at 40 and 80 °C are observed  Both peaks may be attributed to the reduction of dispersed silver oxide-like species and small oxidized silver clusters Ag +δ n  The peak shoulders at 130 °C may be associated with the reduction of Ag2O on the surface of the catalyst [ 40 ]  The area of peaks in the range of 10–150 °C corresponds to an H2 consumption of ~ 11 µmol/g ( Table 2 )  which corresponds to 10–12 % of Ag+ from the total amount of silver in the catalysts  Therefore  most of the silver is stabilized in a metallic state after oxidative pre-treatment at 750 °C for La1−xAgxFeO3 samples  However  part of the silver could be in ionic ( perhaps  clustered ) forms strongly interacting with the perovskite support ( peaks at above 300 °C ) in regions where reduction of the perovskite and Fe2O3 overlapped  making analysis impossible  Ag addition to LaFeO3 led to a 60 °C shift towards lower temperature for the first reduction peak without affecting the second one  Though TPD-MS analysis is hard to interpret quantitatively  it seems unlikely that such an intense reduction feature can be ascribed to AgOx reduction  due to its very low amount  In general  the catalytic performance of materials for oxidation reactions is correlated with the capability to activate oxygen  Figure 5 presents the oxygen desorption behaviour ( O2-TPD profiles ) of the samples  However  from the TPD profiles  it is hard to differentiate the oxygen species desorbed from the samples based on the desorption temperature due to the very weak and broad peaks observed in the profiles  In general  three major oxygen desorption regions were observed for perovskite samples  The first desorption peaks belong to the α-oxygen region ( < 200 °C )  which was mainly the physical adsorbed oxygen species ( O2 ) ( < 100 °C ) and part of the active chemically adsorbed surface oxygen ( O2− or O −2 2 ) with weak interaction with surface vacancies ( 60–300 °C )  The oxygen species desorbed in the 200–500 °C range of were assigned to chemisorbed surface ( O2− or O −2 2 ) and sub-surface-active oxygen ( O− )  which was denoted as β-oxygen  The sub-surface oxygen ( O− ) was chemically adsorbed on oxygen vacancies with strong interaction with defects ( dislocation and grain frontiers ) ( 300–600 °C )  The high-temperature desorption peaks appearing above 500 °C were attributed to perovskite bulk lattice oxygen ( O−2 )  so-called γ-oxygen  Fig  5 figure 5 Oxygen-temperature-programmed desorption profiles : LaFeO3 ( a )  La085Ag015FeO3 ( b )  La075Ag025FeO3 ( c ) Full size image As shown in Fig  5a  O2-TPD results indicated that the O2 desorption peak of pure LaFeO3 carrier is very weak ( ~ 31 µmol/g ) with one desorption peak at 300 °C and very small shoulders at 201 °C  However  the O2-TPD profile of La1−xAgxFeO3 catalyst shows that there are six oxygen desorption peaks at 140  220  300  370  454 and 650 °C obtained after deconvolution of broad TPD-O2 profiles  which are associated with presence of dispersed Ag° as well as Ag+ incorporated in the bulk perovskite lattice in A-sites  Additional oxygen desorption is associated with dispersed Ag0 as well as Ag+ incorporated in the bulk perovskite lattice in A-sites  Total oxygen desorption is increased to 103 and 146 µmol/g for La085Ag015FeO3 and La075Ag025FeO3 samples  respectively  The amount of active surface oxygen species of the catalyst increases with increasing silver content and the size of Ag particles ( Table 3 )  Table 3 Results of quantitative analysis of O2-TPD profiles Full size table 314 XPS Measurements An analysis of the calculated La/Fe atomic ratios ( Table 4 ) for the powders of the La09Ag01FeO3 ( La/Fe = 24 ) and the La075Ag025FeO3 ( La/Fe = 287 ) perovskites showed that their surfaces were enriched in La relative to the nominal bulk concentration  09 and 075  respectively  Table 4 Elemental composition of powdered perovskites : La09Ag01FeO3 and La075Ag025FeO3 calcined at 750 °C  fresh ( after heating at 700 °C for 1 h ) and after 50 h of heat-treatment at 700 °C  and of monolithic catalysts with La075Ag025FeO3 perovskite deposited on FeCr20Al5 support : fresh and after 20 h of heating at 700 °C Full size table A comparison of the atomic ratios Ag/Fe and Ag/La and the absolute Ag contents in the samples analysed as-received and after Ar+ sputtering  shows the Ag content to be higher on the surface than inside the grains of perovskites La1−xAgxFeO3  x = 01 and 025 ( Table 4 )  Moderate Ar+ sputtering ( 2 keV  4 μA/cm2  60 s ) resulted in a three-fold reduction ( as measured by the ratios Ag/Fe and Ag/La ) in Ag content on the surface of the La075Ag025FeO3 sample and in a 25-fold reduction in Ag content on the surface of the La09Ag01FeO3 sample  This applies to both the fresh perovskite powders and after heat-treatment in air at 700 °C for 50 h However  after 50 h of heating  the La075Ag025FeO3 perovskite showed a further four-fold reduction in Ag content ( as measured by the ratios Ag/Fe and Ag/La ) on the analysed as-received surface  from 068 and 024 to 015 and 006  respectively ( Table 4 )  This may be indicative of silver incorporation into the structure of the perovskite after long heating at a temperature of 700 °C or silver agglomeration  Additionally  for the monolithic catalyst obtained by depositing La075Ag025FeO3 perovskite on the support made of FeCr20Al5 foil  the La/Fe ratio of 486 is considerably higher than the stoichiometric ratio and higher than the ratio obtained for the perovskite powder ( Table 4 )  which indicates an La concentration gradient in the catalyst ’ s depth profile  As a result of the selective segregation of La towards the surface  the surface silver fraction relative to the lanthanum fraction ( calculated as Ag/La ) decreased from 024 ( the perovskite powder ) to 013 ( the catalyst )  and after 20 h of heating the catalyst at 700 °C it remained essentially unchanged  At the same conditions  the Ag/Fe ratio remained at 068 ( the perovskite powder ) and 063 ( the catalyst )  After 20 h of heating  the Ag/Fe ratio decreased to 053  After heat-treatment the catalyst containing La075Ag025FeO3 perovskite deposited on a support made of FeCr20Al5 foil at 700 °C for 1 h  the XPS spectrum showed the presence 120 wt % aluminium ( Table 4 )  The presence of Al was the result of the segregation of Al3+ ions from the bulk of the FeCr20Al5 alloy towards the surface and then out of the surface of the La1−xAgxFeO3/FeCrAl catalyst at high temperatures  Initially  no Al was observed in the fresh catalyst calcined at a temperature of 500 °C  The surfaces of all the analysed samples contained considerable amounts of adventitious carbon and its compounds ( Table 4 )  Ar+ sputtering revealed that the carbon content had a mostly superficial character  A close look at the Ag 3d5/2 binding energies of metallic silver and its oxides  compiled in the NIST XPS database [ 41 ] and reported in other works [ 42  43 ] shows some dispersion of the values and their superpositions ( three different silver chemical states fall within the 12 eV interval )  which makes the assignment of spectral features a difficult task  Ag 3d5/2 is reported to range from 3679 to 3684 eV for Ag0  from 3676 to 3685 eV for Ag2O and from 3673 to 3681 eV for AgO  For these reasons  the use of the Modified Auger Parameter ( MAP ) to distinguish silver oxidation states is usually considered to be more reliable than finding the absolute ( corrected ) binding energy of Ag 3d5/2  Another advantage of the MAP is that it does not depend on the sample charge shift and so one avoids a charge correction of the spectrum  which can be misleading due to the existence of substrate/overlayer contact potentials or differential charges  However  it is still practically impossible to distinguish Ag2O from AgO  especially when the oxides occur simultaneously [ 42 ]  Figures 6 and 7 show high-resolution XPS spectra of Ag 3d and Ag MNN envelopes in the analysed samples  In the simplified deconvolution procedure  only two species of silver were hypothetically assumed  ie  Ag oxides ( AgO and Ag2O ) and metallic Ag  shifted relative to each other by 08 ± 005 eV [ 41 ]  Fig  6 figure 6 Narrow XPS scans of Ag 3d ( a ) and Ag MNN ( b ) region for La075Ag025FeO3 powder after 50 h of heat-treatment at 700 °C  analysed in as-received form and after Ar+ sputtering ( c ) Full size image Fig  7 figure 7 Narrow XPS scans of Ag 3d ( a ) and Ag MNN ( b ) region for La075Ag025FeO3/FeCrAl catalyst freshly prepared and heat-treatment at 700 °C for 1 h  analysed in as-received form and after Ar+ sputtering ( c ) Full size image In the case of La075Ag025FeO3 powders heat-treatment at 700 °C for 50 h  the calculated values of MAP  ie  MAP1 ( 3d5/2—M4N45N45 ) and MAP2 ( 3d5/2—M5N45N45 )  amounted to 7242 and 7187 eV  respectively ( Fig  6 ) as well as narrow Ag 3d5/2 ( FWHM 17 eV ) peak clearly indicated the silver to be in the oxidized homogenous form [ 42 ]  Its binding energy amounted to 3679 eV and was assigned to AgO  However  the best fit was achieved by assuming the presence of small amounts of metallic Ag that can occur under the silver oxide layer  In fact  moderate Ar+ sputtering revealed that the thin AgxO film covered Ag0 crystallites since  after the sputtering  the fraction of metallic silver in the Ag 3d spectrum increased from about 6 to 23 %  The above procedure for interpreting Ag 3d spectra was also applied to the surface of the fresh La075Ag025FeO3/FeCrAl catalyst heated at 700 °C for 1 h just before the sample was put into the UHV chamber  Additionally  in this case  the values of MAP1 and MAP2  amounting to 718 and 724 eV  respectively  unequivocally indicated the dominant presence of AgxO on the catalyst ’ s surface ( Fig  7 )  But the Ag M4N45N45 and Ag M5N45N45 peaks were not as well separated from each other as in Fig  6  which indicated greater heterogeneity of the Ag forms  including a larger fraction of Ag0  The percentage of Ag0/Agtotal on the as-received surface ( evaluated based on the deconvolution of the Ag 3d spectra )  amounted to about 34 %  after sputtering this percentage increased to 43 %  Based on the Ag 3d and Ag MNN spectra and the elemental analyses ( Table 4 )  one can conclude that the heat-treatment of La075Ag025FeO3 powder for 50 h and the catalyst made of this powder for 20 h at 700 °C resulted in an increase in the amount of Ag incorporated into the structure of the perovskite  Some of the silver probably underwent sintering/agglomeration  This is confirmed by XRD analyses  showing that the amount of Ag0 decreased after heat-treatment of the La075Ag025FeO3 perovskite for 50 h ( Fig  1 )  The shapes of the Fe spectra of all the analysed samples were very similar to each other  In the Fe 2p spectra ( Fig  8 ) two distinct peaks at binding energies of ∼ 7104 eV for Fe 2p3/2 and ∼ 7239 eV for Fe 2p1/2 with a shakeup satellite at ~ 7189 eV are observed  That latter peak corresponds to the characteristic of Fe3+ ions in their oxide form  Fig  8 figure 8 Fe 2p core level XPS spectra of La075Ag025FeO3 powders : freshly prepared ( a )  heat-treatment at 700 °C for 50 h ( b )  La075Ag025FeO3/FeCrAl catalyst after 20 h of work at 690–700 °C ( c ) Full size image The La 3d doublets located at 8340 and 8508 eV ( the spectra are not included ) were ascribed to the La–O bonds of 3d5/2 and 3d3/2  Each of the doublets was further split into two components  due to the charge transfer from the ligand 2p level to the La 4f level  The spin–orbit splitting gap of ∼ 168 eV between 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 peaks is also indicative of the La3+ state [ 44 ]  32 Catalyst Activity Testing 321 Activity of the Catalysts in Methane Oxidation The investigations have shown that the substitution of some of the La3+ in LaFeO3 with Ag+ results in an increase in the perovskite ’ s activity in methane oxidation  The test results presented in Fig  9a and in Table 5 show that when the silver content in the La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskite is increased from 005 mol to 025 mol  the catalyst ’ s activity increases and the temperature of methane conversion over the catalyst goes down  Even when as little as 005 mol of the lanthanum is substituted with silver  T10 and T50 are lower by 18 and 8 °C  respectively  in comparison to the catalyst without silver  containing 159 wt % LaFeO3  A marked increase in methane oxidation activity  in comparison with the LaFeO3 catalyst  is observed for the catalysts with La08Ag02FeO3 and La075Ag025FeO3 perovskites  The activity of the catalysts with perovskites containing silver is higher even though the La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskite content in the catalyst is over 3 wt % lower ( 122–129 wt % ) than the LaFeO3 content ( 159 wt % )  Additionally  the activity of all the catalysts with perovskites La1−xAgxFeO3x = 005–025 is distinctly higher than that of the catalyst containing 107 wt % LaFeO3  The catalysts with the La075Ag025FeO3 perovskite  containing the largest amount of silver  show the highest activity in methane oxidation ( Fig  9a )  Fig  9 figure 9 Methane conversion over La1−xAgxFeO3x = 0–025 as a function of temperature ( a )  and Arrhenius plots of reaction rates over same samples ( b )  Experimental conditions : methane concentration 1 % vol  in air  GHSV 5800 h−1 ( based on total monolith volume )  atmospheric pressure Full size image Table 5 Temperatures at light-off ( T10 )  50 % ( T50 ) and 90 % ( T90 ) conversion of methane and hexane over monolithic La1−xAgxFeO3x = 0–025 perovskite catalysts Full size table In order to determine the apparent activation energy of the methane oxidation reaction over the particular perovskites  the ln [ −ln ( 1 − α ) ] = ( 1000/T ) dependence  where α is the conversion of methane and T is the catalyst temperature  was plotted ( Fig  9b ) [ 7  14 ]  The values of apparent activation energy ( Ea ) were calculated from the Arrhenius equation based on the slope of the plotted straight line  Ea for methane oxidation over the LaFeO3 catalyst is 1066 kJ/mol  Silver addition to LaFeO3 perovskite lowers the Ea to about 915–912 kJ/mol for x = 02 and 025 ( Table 5 )  This indicates that the introduced silver has a considerable influence on methane oxidation over the catalysts tested  The specific surface of the perovskites does not contribute to the increase in the activity of the La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites as the Ag content is increased since for the perovskites containing 005–025 mol of Ag this surface is similar  amounting to 52–56 m2/g ( Table 1 )  The specific surface of the perovskites which contain Ag is smaller than that of the LaFeO3 perovskite ( 76 m2/g )  Thus  it can be concluded that the silver introduced into the perovskite enhances its methane oxidation activity  The obtained results show that  for the preparation method used  the solubility of silver in the LaFeO3 perovskite is low  XRD tests showed that a small amount of Ag0 ( with crystallites 31–41 nm in size ) is already present apart from the perovskite phase in La1−xAgxFeO3 at x ≥ 01  Additionally  the mapping of the surface of the catalyst containing La075Ag025FeO3 shows that silver precipitations are present on the surface of the perovskite layer  Other researchers point to the low solubility of silver in LaMO3 perovskites  where M = Mn  Co  Fe [ 4  15  22232425 ]  XPS tests show that the metallic silver present on the surface of La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites  x = 01  015  025  is coated with a thin film of AgxO  which suggests that Ag0 undergoes superficial oxidation during perovskite preparation  This is confirmed by TPR tests which showed that in La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites  x = 015  025  only 10–12 % of the total silver is in the form of Ag2O  More than 988 % of the total silver is stabilized in a metallic state or incorporated into the perovskite lattice  Ag2O decomposes to Ag0 at the temperature of 230–330 °C [ 15 ]  ie  at a temperature lower than that at which the oxidation of methane and hexane was conducted  At the above temperatures  the Ag2O coating the surface of Ag0 decomposes and metallic silver is present in the catalysts  favourably affecting their activity  The Ag0 covered by a stable surface oxygen species appears to be the active phase at methane oxidation  Large Ag0 crystallites 31–41 nm in size were found ( XRD ) to be present in the La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites  The size of the Ag crystallites increases from 31 nm ( x = 005 ) to 41 nm ( x = 025 ) ( Table 1 ) with the silver content in the perovskite  The simultaneous increase in the activity of the catalysts is evidence of the high activity of the large crystallites of Ag0  Similar results were obtained by Buchneva et al  [ 5 ] for LaCoO3 perovskite with an Ag addition  They found that large silver crystallites led to weak Ag–O bond and increase oxygen mobility out of the crystal lattice  causing catalyst activity increases  Small silver crystallites strongly bind oxygen  which makes its participation in the oxidation reaction difficult and lowers the activity of the perovskite [ 45 ]  The introduction silver to the LaFeO3 perovskite increases the amount of oxygen desorbed from the perovskite ’ s surface  The O2-TPD profiles of La1−xAgxFeO3x = 0–025 show that the amount of oxygen desorbed from the LaFeO3 perovskite after silver is introduced into it increases from 31 µmol/g for LaFeO3 to 103 and 146 µmol/g for La085Ag015FeO3 and La075Ag025FeO3 ( Table 3 )  This indicates an increase in active surface oxygen species that can take part in the oxidation of hydrocarbons  and an increase in oxygen mobility out of the perovskite  significantly enhancing the effectiveness of hydrocarbon oxidation  Additionally  Choudhary et al  [ 1  2 ] found that the substitution of La with Ag in LaMO3  where M = Co  Mn  Ni  Fe  and LaFe05Co05O3 perovskites increases the reactivity of the perovskite ’ s lattice oxygen at a low temperature  As a result  pure methane oxidation takes place over 30 pulses of the pulse-reaction despite the absence of oxygen in the gaseous phase  The operating stability of the most active monolithic catalyst with the La075Ag025FeO3 perovskite was tested in methane oxidation at a temperature of about 690–700 °C for 50 h During the first 14 h of catalyst operation  the conversion of methane gradually decreased from 100 % at 670 °C to 97–99 % at 690 °C and remained at this level to the end of the test ( Supplementary material Fig  S4 )  After the 50 h long operation of the La075Ag025FeO3 catalyst at 690 °C  T50 and T90 increased by 18 and 19 °C  respectively  in relation to the fresh catalyst ( Table 5 )  But the activity of this catalyst was still higher than the initial activity of the LaFeO3 perovskite catalysts without any silver addition and the activity of fresh catalysts with La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites  x = 005  01 and 015 ( Table 5 )  The XRD  XPS and TPR tests show a reduction in the amount of metallic silver after the heat-treatment of the La075Ag025FeO3 perovskite at 700 °C for 50 h This may indicate an increase in the amount of silver incorporated into the perovskite ’ s structure  However  a reduction in the amount of Ag0 in the perovskite can be one of the causes of the decrease in the catalyst ’ s activity  322 Activity of the Catalysts in Hexane Oxidation As shown in Fig  10  the activities of the catalysts with La095Ag005FeO3 and LaFeO3 perovskites for n-hexane oxidation are very similar  which means that the substitution of 005 mol of La with Ag in the LaFeO3 perovskite does not increase its activity  The catalysts with the La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites at x ≥ 01 show distinctly higher activity than the LaFeO3 catalyst  But in the investigated temperature range  only a slight increase in the catalyst activity is visible as the silver content in La1−xAgxFeO3 is further increased from 01 to 025 mol ( Fig  10 )  The T10 and T50 determined for hexane oxidation over the La08Ag02FeO3 catalyst are lower by only 8 °C for the La09Ag01FeO3 catalyst  T90  475 °C and 490 °C  respectively  was more different for these catalysts ( Table 5 )  As a result of the increase in perovskite silver content from 02 to 025 mol  T10 and T50 decrease by 17 °C and 3 °C  respectively  while T90 does not change  The La075Ag025FeO3 catalyst that had oxidized methane at 690–700 °C for 50 h showed the same activity as fresh catalyst up to about 400 °C when tested for hexane oxidation  At higher temperatures  the catalyst ’ s activity is lower than that of fresh catalyst and after catalyst operation  T90 increases by 35 °C  The La1−xAgxFeO3x = 01–025 catalysts are distinctly more active in hexane activation than the LaFeO3 catalyst without Ag ( Fig  10 )  Similar to methane oxidation  in hexane oxidation the Ag0 present outside of the perovskite shows the ability to adsorb oxygen and to increase oxygen mobility out of the crystal lattice while the partial incorporation of the silver into the perovskite ’ s crystal lattice leads to the deformation of its structure  enhancing the perovskite ’ s activity in hexane oxidation  Pecchi et al  [ 4 ] also found that despite the incomplete incorporation of Ag into the structure of La1−xAgxMn09Co01O3 perovskite the segregating metallic silver phase provides additional active centres in hexane activation  enhancing the catalyst ’ s activity  Fig  10 figure 10 Hexane conversion over La1−xAgxFeO3x = 0–025 as a function of temperature  Experimental conditions : hexane concentration 1500 ppm in air  GHSV 8 900 h −1 ( based on total monolith volume )  atmospheric pressure Full size image 4 Conclusions For the preparation method used  005–01 mol of silver is incorporated into the structure of the LaFeO3 perovskite  At x ≥ 01 some of the silver in the La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskite remains in the form of large crystals of metallic silver ( XRD ) coated with a thin film of silver oxide AgxO ( XPS  TPR )  The introduction of silver into the LaFeO3 perovskite enhances its activity in oxidation methane and n-hexane  The catalysts with La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites show higher activity in n-hexane oxidation at x ≥ 01 and higher activity in methane oxidation at x ≥ 005 than the LaFeO3 catalyst  The activity of the La1−xAgxFeO3 catalysts in the two processes increases as the Ag content increases from 005 to 025 mol  The increase in the catalysts ’ activity after the introduction of Ag into the LaFeO3 perovskite is due to changes taking place in the perovskite after some of the Ag is incorporated in its structure  Metallic silver in the form of large crystals ( 31–41 nm in size ) also plays a major role  increasing the mobility of oxygen from the crystal lattice and total amount of oxygen desorbed from the surface of the catalyst  Monolithic catalysts containing La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites are potential materials to be used in industrial processes such as exhaust gas clean up and catalytic combustion at low temperatureEffect of Silver Addition to LaFeO3 Perovskite on the Activity of Monolithic La1−xAgxFeO3 Perovskite Catalysts in

Mechanism  Characteristics and Novel Strategies Article Open access 28 November 2023 1 Introduction Oxides with a perovskite ABO3 structure  where A is a rare earth element and B is a transition metal  have been investigated for years as materials for various uses [ 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536 ]  They show very good catalytic properties and are less expensive than noble metals  and they can be used as catalysts to oxidize hydrocarbons and carbon oxide  and as three-way catalysts ( TWC ) [ 12345678910111213141516171819202122 ]  Perovskites LaFeO3 [ 12 ] and LaMn09Co01O3 [ 23 ] show good properties  which are further improved by introducing Ag into the perovskite  for the oxidation of carbon black  R1−xAxMnO3 perovskite manganites ( where R is a rare earth cation and A is a doping cation ) exhibit great magnetoresistance and the magnetocaloric effect [ 24 ]  Since mixed ( electron and ionic ) conduction occurs in the LaFeO3 perovskite  the latter can be used in solid oxide fuel cells [ 25 ]  ABO3 perovskites  with La in position A and metal B as Mn  Co  Fe or Cr  show good catalytic properties in oxidation processes [ 6789101112  35  36 ]  The activity of perovskites in methane oxidation decreases in the order : LaCoO3 > LaMnO3  LaFeO3 > LaCrO3 [ 9 ]  Their catalytic activity is determined mainly by oxygen mobility  the redox properties of the transition metals and the perovskite structure  As catalysts  one can also use perovskites in which the cation in position A and/or B is partially substituted with a different valency cation  In such cases  the activity of the catalysts for oxidation reactions is enhanced  When the cation in position A is substituted with a different valency cation  the oxidation number of the cation in position B changes and defects arise in the perovskite ’ s structure [ 123456  13141516171819202122 ]  As a result of a cation deficit  an oxygen deficit or an oxygen excess in position A or B non-stoichiometry may arise in the perovskite [ 4  5  24  25 ]  Oxygen vacancies are more common than cation vacancies in the perovskite ’ s structure [ 23 ]  A considerable increase in the catalytic activity of LaFeO3  LaFe05Co05O3 [ 2 ]  LaNiO3  LaCoO3 [ 1  5 ] and LaMnO3 [ 1  14  15  21 ] perovskites was achieved by partially replacing La+3 in them with an Ag+1 cation  However  there is no agreement between researchers as to the amount of silver which can be incorporated into the crystal lattice of perovskites  This may be due to the large number of different synthesis methods  co-precipitation [ 1  2  15  21  30  31 ]  citrate-gel [ 3  4  23 ]  sol–gel [ 5  27  29 ]  such as solid-state reaction [ 262728 ]  flame pyrolysis [ 5 ]  polyol [ 32 ]  hydrothermal [ 33 ]  combustion [ 24  25  34 ]  spray decomposition [ 21 ] and microemulsion methods [ 35 ]  used in the investigations  Hien et al  [ 27 ] and Ye et al  [ 28 ] found that using various methods to synthesize La1−xAgxMnO3+δ perovskite  a single perovskite phase is obtained at x < 02  Whereas at x > 02 other phases  mainly Ag-metallic ones  also form  Ehi-Eromosele et al  [ 24 ] maintain that when this perovskite was synthesized using the solid-state or sol–gel method  Ag0 was detected apart from the perovskite regardless of the amount of silver introduced  When hydrothermal synthesis was used at x > 004  Ag2O3 was found in addition to the perovskite [ 24 ]  In the case of La1−xAgxMn09Co01O3 prepared using the citrate method  an Ag2O phase  the amount of which increased with the Ag content in the perovskite  was observed [ 23 ]  A single phase of La08Ag015MnO3 perovskite was obtained using rapid solution combustion synthesis and oxalyl dihydrazine as the fuel [ 24 ]  A single phase of La09Ag01Mn09Co01O3 perovskite was obtained using the citrate method [ 4 ]  The research to date has shown that the solubility of silver in perovskites is low  This paper presents the physicochemical properties and methane and hexane oxidation activity of monolithic catalysts containing 122–129 % LaFeO3 perovskite in which some of the lanthanum was substituted with silver to give La1−xAgxFeO3  x = 0–025  The physicochemical properties of the perovskites were determined using the following methods : X-ray diffraction ( XRD )  scanning and transmission electron microscopy ( SEM  TEM )  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS )  BET specific surface area measurement  H2 temperature programmed reduction ( TPR-H2 ) and O2 temperature programmed desorption ( O2-TPD )  The effect of the silver content of the perovskite on the homogeneity of its structure and on the activity and operational stability of the catalysts containing the perovskites was examined  In the literature to date  there are no test results for monolithic catalysts on metallic support containing La1−xAgxFeO3  x = 0–025 perovskite with a silver addition  When a monolithic catalyst is used  the gas flow resistance and pressure drop on the catalyst bed decrease  Moreover  thanks to better contact between the gas and the catalyst ’ s active surface than with granular catalysts  the volume of the catalytic converter can be reduced [ 37 ]  The catalysts investigated can prove effective in removing hydrocarbons from exhaust gases and  thus  protecting the environment  2 Methods and Materials 21 Catalyst Preparation The supports for the monolithic catalysts were made of 005 mm thick heat-resistant FeCr20Al5 foil  They were shaped as 70 mm high and 26 mm diameter cylinders  with a honeycomb cross section with triangular channels  The supports were etched in 10 wt % sulfuric acid at 60 °C for 15 min  washed in distilled water and dried at 150 °C  As a result of this treatment  the specific surface area of the support increased  A washcoat containing Al2O3 with a 012 % addition of La2O3 was deposited on the prepared supports  The sol was obtained by thoroughly mixing 38 wt % Al ( OH ) 3  016 wt % La ( NO3 ) 3·6H2O  25 wt % glycerine and water  A few drops of ammonium hydroxide were added to the sol to obtain a gel  The washcoat was deposited on the monolithic supports by immersing them in the gel  drying them at 150 °C and then calcining at 400 °C for 3 h Oxides having a perovskite structure and the nominal composition La1−xAgxFeO3x = 005–025  were used as the active components  The perovskites were obtained by dissolving appropriate amounts of the precursors  La ( NO3 ) 3·6H2O ( Fluka )  Fe ( NO3 ) 3·9Η2Ο ( POCH ) and AgNO3 ( POCH )  in 150 cm3 of distilled water  The obtained solution was evaporated to dryness at a temperature of 130 °C  pulverized and calcined at 750 °C for 65 h The reaction took place in the solid phase with the liberation of NO2 and O2 gases and the formation of solid La1−x AgxFeO3 perovskites  The general equation for the production of La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites can be proposed as follows : $ $ left ( { 1- { text { x } } } right ) {

ground in a mortar to obtain grains less than 010 mm in diameter  The perovskites were mixed with 06 g/cm3 citric acid solution  obtaining a slurry in which the support was then immersed  The resulting catalysts were calcined at 500 °C for 3 h The catalysts contained 122–129 wt % of the perovskite relative to the weight of the support after etching  In the same way catalysts with the perovskite but with no silver addition  containing 159 wt % and 109 wt % of LaFeO3 were made  22 Structure Characterization of the Catalysts The crystalline and phase identification of the prepared LaFeO3 perovskites was determined by X-ray powder diffraction ( XRD ) using PANanalytical X ’ Pert PRO diffractometer with Cuα radiation ( λ = 015406 nm )  Data were recorded in the 10°–80° 2θ range with an angular step of 0017° and a counting time of 026 s per step  Diffraction peaks of crystalline phases were compared with those of standard compounds reported in the JCPDS Data File  The textural properties of the prepared LaFeO3 perovskites calcined at different temperatures were obtained from nitrogen physisorption measurements at − 196 °C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus  The samples ( ~ 08 g ) were degassed in vacuum at 300 °C for 4 h prior to the measurement  The specific surface area ( SBET ) was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller ( BET ) method and the total pore volume ( Vp ) was determined at a relative pressure of P/Po = 098  The morphological and structural characterization of the LaFeO3 perovskite was additionally performed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy ( HRTEM ) using a Philips CM 20 microscope operated at 200 kV and provided 025 nm resolution  The analysis of the presented phases was made based on the fast Fourier transforms ( FFT ) obtained for the recorded pictures  The distance of the spots and angles between of them were checked with the database using the Process Diffraction program  The morphology of the catalysts was examined using FEI Quanta 250 scanning electron microscope in a secondary electron ( SE ) and back scattered electron ( BSE ) imaging mode  operating at 15 kV under 10−5 Pa pressure  Before SEM examination the samples were sputter coated with a thin layer ( ~ 15 nm ) of carbon  Temperature-programmed reduction ( TPR )  and O2-temperature-programmed desorption ( O2-TPD-MS ) were carried out using a Micromeritics apparatus model Autochem II 2920 with a thermal conductivity detector ( TCD )  The composition of the outlet gas was continuously monitored by means of a quadrupole mass spectrometer ( OmniStar QMS-200 from Pfeiffer Vacuum )  The catalyst ( 02 g ) was loaded in a quartz reactor  and prior to every TPD or TPR run was heated ( 10 °C/min ) up to 750 °C in flowing synthetic air  TPD-MS of pre-adsorbed oxygen was carried out in He as carrier gas ( 30 cm3/min )  after a saturation of the sample in 20 cm3/min of oxygen at 750 °C  followed by cooling down to 50 °C  The following temperature program was adopted : the catalyst was kept at 50 °C for 10 min  the temperature was then raised ( 10 °C/min ) to 900 °C  In TPR analysis  a 5 % H2/Ar ( 30 cm3/min ) stream was passed through the sample and the temperature was raised from 20 to 1000 °C with a ramp of 10 °C/min  XRD measurements were performed at the end of the TPR-H2 run  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) measurements were performed using a SPECS PHOIBOS 100 spectrometer and Mg anode ( 12536 eV ) operating at 250 W for high resolution spectra  Before the analysis the surface was cleaned by Ar+ sputtering with a low energy beam ( 2 keV  4 μA/cm2  60 s )  The spectra were processed and fitted by the SPECLAB and CasaXPS software using the Gaussian–Lorentzian curve profile and the Shirley baseline  The accuracy of the reported binding energies was ± 01 eV  The C 1s peak at 2848 eV  representing carbon contamination  was used as the reference for all the spectra  23 Catalytic Activity Measurements The catalytic activity in the complete oxidation of methane and n-hexane was tested in a quartz flow reactor placed in a electrical furnace with a controlled temperature rise  The reaction temperature was measured by a Cr-NiCr thermocouple placed in a monolith channel at the height of 16 mm from the gas outlet  1 % of methane was oxidized in air in the 400–700 °C range  The total gas hourly space velocity ( GHSV ) for methane oxidation amounted to 5800 h−1 ( based on the total monolith volume )  Also the activity of the catalysts in the oxidation of 1500 ppm of n-hexane in air in the 270–560 °C range and at the GHSV of 8900 h−1 was tested  Measurements were taken for each catalyst two times  and the measurement error was about ± 1 % of methane conversion measured  The methane and carbon dioxide concentrations before and after the oxidation reaction were measured using a DP-27 analyser made by Nanosens  The analyser can measure CH4 concentrations in a range of 000–500 vol % and CO2 concentrations in a range of 000–1000 % vol  with an accuracy of ± 005  A MEXA-574GE analyser made by Horiba was used to measure n-hexane and carbon dioxide concentrations in hexane oxidation  The analyser measures hexane concentrations within a range of 000–10000 ppm  CO2 concentrations within a range of 000–2000 % vol  and CO concentrations within a range of 000–1000 vol %  The conversion of hydrocarbons over the tested catalysts was calculated from the methane and n-hexane concentrations measured before and after the reaction  3 Results and Discussion 31 Catalysts Characterization 311 Structural Characterization ( XRD  BET ) The presence of a LaFeO3 perovskite phase  characterized by the strongest reflection at 2θ of ~ 33° ( PDF card No  70-7777 )  was found in the XRD patterns of the prepared LaFeO3 ( Fig  1a ) and La1−xAgxFeO3x = 005–025 catalyst samples ( Fig  1b–f )  The diffractogram recorded for the La075Ag025FeO3 sample after heat-treatment for 50 h at 700 °C is also presented ( Fig  1g )  The long-term heating can be considered a simulation of the catalytic reaction conditions  The LaFeO3 material can be described with orthorhombic symmetry in the Pbnm space group  After incorporation of silver ions into the LaFeO3 perovskite  its crystal structure did not change  However  the prepared catalytic materials are not a single phase because the XRD patterns of all samples  aside from reflections coming from the LaFeO3 perovskite structure  exhibit lines which are characteristic for La ( OH ) 3 ( 2θ at 157°  273°  280°  395° and 486° ) ( PDF Card No  83-2034 ) with a hexagonal system and P63/m space group ( Fig  1a–f )  The intensity of these reflections is similar for the La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites with 005 ≤ x ≤ 02 ( Fig  1 )  Additionally  the XRD patterns of the La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites with x = 01–025 also exhibit peaks ascribed to metallic silver ( 2θ at 381°  446° and 646° ) ( PDF Card No  06-4997 ) and the intensity of these peaks increases with the rise of Ag in the perovskite  This proves the incomplete incorporation of the silver into the LaFeO3 perovskite crystal structure and the high silver segregation upon increasing the amount of Ag in the perovskite  However  according to Pecchi et al  [ 4 ]  due to the close proximity of the strongest diffraction lines of Ag0 and Ag2O ( PDF card No  12-793 )  it has been impossible to ascertain whether or not Ag2O is present in the perovskite samples studied  Metallic Ag is not visible only in the XRD pattern of the La095Ag005FeO3 perovskite ie  for the sample with the lowest Ag content  Therefore  due to the limited solubility of Ag in LaFeO3  diffraction peaks of La1−xAgxFeO3 are not shifted towards the lower 2θ angles in comparison to corresponding peaks of the LaFeO3 sample  Bellakki et al  [ 25 ] observed peak associated with AgO  which was not visible at lower Ag content  in the XRD pattern of La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites for x > 03 ( synthesized by the combustion process using glycine as a fuel )  This demonstrates better incorporation of Ag into the perovskite structure than in our perovskites  in which the Ag peak is already visible at x = 01  Fig  1 figure 1 XRD patterns recorded for LaFeO3 ( a )  La095Ag005FeO3 ( b )  La090Ag010FeO3 ( c )  La085Ag015FeO3 ( d )  La080Ag020FeO3 ( e ) and La075Ag025FeO3 ( f ) perovskites calcined at 750 °C for 65 h and for La075Ag025FeO3 after additional heat-treatment at 700 °C for 50 h ( g ) Full size image Heating La075Ag025FeO3 perovskite for 50 h in air at 700 °C does not substantially alter the perovskite structure  as can be seen in Fig  1g  However  the reflections from the Ag phase are characterized by a weaker intensity in comparison to that from a fresh sample ( Fig  1f )  The reason may be better silver incorporation into the LaFeO3 perovskite crystal structure in the catalysts during the long-term heating  The disappearance of the reflections from the La ( OH ) 3 structure can be also seen  which was expected  After such a long time of heating  the complete conversion of the lanthanum and iron compounds to LaFeO3 perovskite occurs  The average crystallite size of LaFeO3  La1−xAgxFeO3 and metallic Ag was calculated using the Scherrer formula and the results are shown in Table 1  For LaFeO3  the average crystallite size was 48 nm and for the Ag-substituted perovskites  it was 45–47 nm  The average crystallite size of metallic Ag  calculated from the line broadening of the Ag peak at 2θ = 381° ( the most intensive Ag peak partly overlapped with a weak perovskite peak ) amounted to 31  36  40 and 41 nm for the La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskite with x = 01  015  020 and 025  respectively  However  the Ag crystallite size calculated from the peak at 2θ = 446° ( not overlapped  but low peak intensity ) was much lower  30 nm  for the perovskite with x = 020 and 025  Table 1 Characterization data for prepared La1−xAgxFeO3x = 0–025 perovskite powders and catalysts Full size table HRTEM studies of the catalysts not doped with silver and calcined in air at 750 °C for 65 h  confirmed the presence of the LaFeO3 and La ( OH ) 3 phases in the sample  as was visible on the XRD diffractograms  Example pictures in Fig  S1 ( Supplementary material ) show crystallites with lattice fringes of about 032 nm and 028 nm distance  which fit those of the ( 120 ) and ( 200 ) LaFeO3 crystal planes  respectively  The fast Fourier transform ( FFT ) from this phase contains spots with a 55° angle between them  which corresponds to the values from the database for an orthorhombic perovskite structure  Analogical analysis revealed spots in the FFT at 033 nm and 039 nm with a 90° angle between them  which characterized the ( 110 ) and ( 001 ) La ( OH ) 3 crystal planes  respectively  Additionally  very small particles of Fe2O3 with lattice fringes of 037 nm and 027 nm distance ( 47° angle between spots in the FFT )  which fit the ( 012 ) and ( 104 ) crystallographic planes  were also visible  In some pictures  La2O3 crystallites exhibited as a 030 nm spot from ( 101 ) crystal plane were present in FFT ( Fig  S1 )  These small particles ( less than 5 nm ) could not be detected by XRD  These results clearly indicate that Fe2O3 and La2O3 did not completely react under the synthesis conditions used  The unreacted iron oxide is present in the sample in the form of very small particles dispersed on the perovskite crystallites  By contrast  most of the unreacted lanthanum oxide is transformed into La ( OH ) 3 after exposure to the wet air at room temperature  Generally  lanthanum oxide is known to be highly hygroscopic and powder samples of La2O3 rapidly convert to lanthanum hydroxide in wet air [ 38 ]  For this reason  we additionally prepared the fresh LaFeO3 and La075Ag025FeO3 samples by storing them in an He atmosphere before the XRD measurements  Next  the catalysts were exposed to air overnight at room temperature and the second XRD experiments were carried out  The XRD diffractograms obtained are presented in Fig  S2 ( Supplementary material )  Thus  it is clearly visible that the XRD profiles from fresh catalysts contain the reflections from La2O3 structure ( PDF card No  05-0602 )  while those from the samples after the exposure to wet air are characterized by reflections from the La ( OH ) 3 phase  Texture characteristics of the calcined perovskites were determined based on the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the results are listed in Table 1  Regardless of the amount of silver in the La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskite  their specific surface area is nearly the same  52–56 m2/g  They are slightly lower than the specific surface area of the unsubstituted LaFeO3 perovskite ( 76 m2/g )  However  the total pore volume significantly drops from 004 cm3/g to 0012–0015 cm3/g for the LaFeO3 and La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites  respectively  This may suggest incorporation of the silver into the pores of the LaFeO3 perovskite  312 SEM–EDX Measurements An SEM analysis revealed that  irrespective of the Ag content  the active layers of La1−xAgxFeO3/FeCr20Al5 catalysts were cracked and porous ( Fig  2 )  Increasing the silver content ( x ) in the La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskite from 010 to 025 did not result in any significant changes in the morphology of the catalysts ( Figs  2a–c )  whereas a distinct difference is observed on the fracture surfaces of the layers  The catalysts ’ active layers containing 010 and 015 mol of Ag ( Figs  2a and 2b ) have a fine-grained structure  as opposed to the layer containing 025 mol of Ag  which is less compact and composed of agglomerates a few hundred nm in size ( Fig  2c )  The surfaces of all the active layers are heterogeneous with randomly distributed light precipitations about 1 µm in size  These precipitations are particularly visible in the BSE mode ( Figs  2a–c )  which indicates that their chemical composition differs from the bulk catalyst composition  This is confirmed by the layer surface mapping results from the La075Ag025FeO3 perovskite with the highest Ag content ( Fig  3 )  Although no quantitative differences in the catalyst ’ s chemical composition within the analysed area can be seen in the recorded elemental maps  the latter clearly show that the small precipitations visible in Fig  2 are enriched with Ag  This hypothesis is supported by the distribution of Ag shown in Fig  3 and by the spectra for the whole surface of the sample and for those light precipitations included in this figure  One can clearly see that only silver is distributed nonuniformly  The other elements ( oxygen  lanthanum and iron ) are homogeneously distributed on the surface  Fig  2 figure 2 Morphology of La1−xAgxFeO3 catalysts with silver addition for x : 01 ( a )

result of catalyst heat-treatment for 50 h  the layer ’ s surface becomes more porous and the previously visible silver-enriched precipitations disappear  Therefore  one can suppose that the silver was redistributed during the 50 h of catalyst operation  and the microscale chemical composition became homogenous  313 TPR  TPD Measurements The reduction process of the La1−xAgxFeO3 catalysts with different silver loadings was investigated using a TPR technique  Figure 4 presents the TPR profiles of a standard LaFeO3 sample and of La1−xAgxFeO3 for x = 015  025 catalysts calcined at 750 °C  Fig  4 figure 4 TPR curves for LaFeO3 catalyst calcined at 750 °C ( a )  and La1−xAgxFeO3 catalysts with silver loading x : 015 ( b ) and 025 ( c ) ; insets show the expanded low-temperature region where reduction of isolated Ag+ occurs Full size image XRD and HRTEM data showed that after heat treatment at 750 °C  the samples showed a partially ordered orthorhombic LaFeO3 phase that was contaminated mainly by La2O3/La ( OH ) 3 and amorphous Fe2O3 phases  Table 2 shows the average Fe2O3 content calculated from TPR results of perovskite samples  Nevertheless  the presence of an amorphous Fe2O3 phase can not be easily recognized due to the limitations of the XRD technique  Table 2 Results of quantitative analysis on the TPR-H2 profiles of La1−xAgxFeO3x = 0  015  025 perovskites Full size table It has been reported that the very weak TPR profiles of pure LaFeO3 were affected by preparation method  and especially by the temperature of calcination  mainly due to phase impurities ( Fe2O3 ) [ 39 ]  As shown in Fig  4a  the reduction of LaFeO3 was a stepwise process in the 150–350 °C region  The first reduction peak of the perovskite sample ( about 200 °C ) was assigned to the removal of adsorbed oxygen species  and the peak at 320 °C was due to the reduction of Fe+4 to Fe+3  The TPR signal at high temperatures  > 750 °C  ( not completely detected  even up to 1000 °C )  can be attributed to the reduction of perovskite lattice oxygen and/or part of the Fe+3/Fe+2 to Fe0  These signals are equal for all samples  The quantitative hydrogen consumption is shown in Table 2  In Fig  4a  the main H2 consumption is in the 350–750 °C range and is related mainly to the reduction of the Fe2O3 phase ( see HRTEM Fig  S1 Supplementary material )  The reason for the formation of nanocrystalline Fe2O3 could be the short time of calcination ( 65 h ) or insufficient temperature ( 750 °C ) during the calcination process  It ’ s well known  that the TPR profile of Fe2O3 contains two composite peaks  According to the calculated area ratios of individual peaks at about 420 °C and the broad peak at 590 °C  which was about 1:8 for pristine Fe2O3 ( see Table 2 )  we assume the following three-step Fe2O3 reduction process : Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe  The XRD spectra collected after TPR experiments ( Fig  S3 Supplementary material ) up to 1000 °C revealed the presence of metallic iron ( α-Fe )  Perovskite was always present as the most abundant phase and this should testify to the reduction only of a fraction of Fe+3/Fe+2 ions in the B-sites of the perovskite  Moreover  in order to preserve the perovskite structure  a fraction of La ( Ag ) ions should also be expelled from the A-sites and  in fact  extra very active dispersed metallic silver nanoclusters are present out of the perovskite lattice  Additionally  Ag-Fe nano-alloys were found after the TPR run in perovskite samples containing Ag  In the low-temperature region ( 10–150 °C ) for La1−xAgxFeO3 samples  two very low peaks ( insets in Fig  4b  c ) of H2 consumption with a maximum at 40 and 80 °C are observed  Both peaks may be attributed to the reduction of dispersed silver oxide-like species and small oxidized silver clusters Ag +δ n  The peak shoulders at 130 °C may be associated with the reduction of Ag2O on the surface of the catalyst [ 40 ]  The area of peaks in the range of 10–150 °C corresponds to an H2 consumption of ~ 11 µmol/g ( Table 2 )  which corresponds to 10–12 % of Ag+ from the total amount of silver in the catalysts  Therefore  most of the silver is stabilized in a metallic state after oxidative pre-treatment at 750 °C for La1−xAgxFeO3 samples  However  part of the silver could be in ionic ( perhaps  clustered ) forms strongly interacting with the perovskite support ( peaks at above 300 °C ) in regions where reduction of the perovskite and Fe2O3 overlapped  making analysis impossible  Ag addition to LaFeO3 led to a 60 °C shift towards lower temperature for the first reduction peak without affecting the second one  Though TPD-MS analysis is hard to interpret quantitatively  it seems unlikely that such an intense reduction feature can be ascribed to AgOx reduction  due to its very low amount  In general  the catalytic performance of materials for oxidation reactions is correlated with the capability to activate oxygen  Figure 5 presents the oxygen desorption behaviour ( O2-TPD profiles ) of the samples  However  from the TPD profiles  it is hard to differentiate the oxygen species desorbed from the samples based on the desorption temperature due to the very weak and broad peaks observed in the profiles  In general  three major oxygen desorption regions were observed for perovskite samples  The first desorption peaks belong to the α-oxygen region ( < 200 °C )  which was mainly the physical adsorbed oxygen species ( O2 ) ( < 100 °C ) and part of the active chemically adsorbed surface oxygen ( O2− or O −2 2 ) with weak interaction with surface vacancies ( 60–300 °C )  The oxygen species desorbed in the 200–500 °C range of were assigned to chemisorbed surface ( O2− or O −2 2 ) and sub-surface-active oxygen ( O− )  which was denoted as β-oxygen  The sub-surface oxygen ( O− ) was chemically adsorbed on oxygen vacancies with strong interaction with defects ( dislocation and grain frontiers ) ( 300–600 °C )  The high-temperature desorption peaks appearing above 500 °C were attributed to perovskite bulk lattice oxygen ( O−2 )  so-called γ-oxygen  Fig  5 figure 5 Oxygen-temperature-programmed desorption profiles : LaFeO3 ( a )  La085Ag015FeO3 ( b )  La075Ag025FeO3 ( c ) Full size image As shown in Fig  5a  O2-TPD results indicated that the O2 desorption peak of pure LaFeO3 carrier is very weak ( ~ 31 µmol/g ) with one desorption peak at 300 °C and very small shoulders at 201 °C  However  the O2-TPD profile of La1−xAgxFeO3 catalyst shows that there are six oxygen desorption peaks at 140  220  300  370  454 and 650 °C obtained after deconvolution of broad TPD-O2 profiles  which are associated with presence of dispersed Ag° as well as Ag+ incorporated in the bulk perovskite lattice in A-sites  Additional oxygen desorption is associated with dispersed Ag0 as well as Ag+ incorporated in the bulk perovskite lattice in A-sites  Total oxygen desorption is increased to 103 and 146 µmol/g for La085Ag015FeO3 and La075Ag025FeO3 samples  respectively  The amount of active surface oxygen species of the catalyst increases with increasing silver content and the size of Ag particles ( Table 3 )  Table 3 Results of quantitative analysis of O2-TPD profiles Full size table 314 XPS Measurements An analysis of the calculated La/Fe atomic ratios ( Table 4 ) for the powders of the La09Ag01FeO3 ( La/Fe = 24 ) and the La075Ag025FeO3 ( La/Fe = 287 ) perovskites showed that their surfaces were enriched in La relative to the nominal bulk concentration  09 and 075  respectively  Table 4 Elemental composition of powdered perovskites : La09Ag01FeO3 and La075Ag025FeO3 calcined at 750 °C  fresh ( after heating at 700 °C for 1 h ) and after 50 h of heat-treatment at 700 °C  and of monolithic catalysts with La075Ag025FeO3 perovskite deposited on FeCr20Al5 support : fresh and after 20 h of heating at 700 °C Full size table A comparison of the atomic ratios Ag/Fe and Ag/La and the absolute Ag contents in the samples analysed as-received and after Ar+ sputtering  shows the Ag content to be higher on the surface than inside the grains of perovskites La1−xAgxFeO3  x = 01 and 025 ( Table 4 )  Moderate Ar+ sputtering ( 2 keV  4 μA/cm2  60 s ) resulted in a three-fold reduction ( as measured by the ratios Ag/Fe and Ag/La ) in Ag content on the surface of the La075Ag025FeO3 sample and in a 25-fold reduction in Ag content on the surface of the La09Ag01FeO3 sample  This applies to both the fresh perovskite powders and after heat-treatment in air at 700 °C for 50 h However  after 50 h of heating  the La075Ag025FeO3 perovskite showed a further four-fold reduction in Ag content ( as measured by the ratios Ag/Fe and Ag/La ) on the analysed as-received surface  from 068 and 024 to 015 and 006  respectively ( Table 4 )  This may be indicative of silver incorporation into the structure of the perovskite after long heating at a temperature of 700 °C or silver agglomeration  Additionally  for the monolithic catalyst obtained by depositing La075Ag025FeO3 perovskite on the support made of FeCr20Al5 foil  the La/Fe ratio of 486 is considerably higher than the stoichiometric ratio and higher than the ratio obtained for the perovskite powder ( Table 4 )  which indicates an La concentration gradient in the catalyst ’ s depth profile  As a result of the selective segregation of La towards the surface  the surface silver fraction relative to the lanthanum fraction ( calculated as Ag/La ) decreased from 024 ( the perovskite powder ) to 013 ( the catalyst )  and after 20 h of heating the catalyst at 700 °C it remained essentially unchanged  At the same conditions  the Ag/Fe ratio remained at 068 ( the perovskite powder ) and 063 ( the catalyst )  After 20 h of heating  the Ag/Fe ratio decreased to 053  After heat-treatment the catalyst containing La075Ag025FeO3 perovskite deposited on a support made of FeCr20Al5 foil at 700 °C for 1 h  the XPS spectrum showed the presence 120 wt % aluminium ( Table 4 )  The presence of Al was the result of the segregation of Al3+ ions from the bulk of the FeCr20Al5 alloy towards the surface and then out of the surface of the La1−xAgxFeO3/FeCrAl catalyst at high temperatures  Initially  no Al was observed in the fresh catalyst calcined at a temperature of 500 °C  The surfaces of all the analysed samples contained considerable amounts of adventitious carbon and its compounds ( Table 4 )  Ar+ sputtering revealed that the carbon content had a mostly superficial character  A close look at the Ag 3d5/2 binding energies of metallic silver and its oxides  compiled in the NIST XPS database [ 41 ] and reported in other works [ 42  43 ] shows some dispersion of the values and their superpositions ( three different silver chemical states fall within the 12 eV interval )  which makes the assignment of spectral features a difficult task  Ag 3d5/2 is reported to range from 3679 to 3684 eV for Ag0  from 3676 to 3685 eV for Ag2O and from 3673 to 3681 eV for AgO  For these reasons  the use of the Modified Auger Parameter ( MAP ) to distinguish silver oxidation states is usually considered to be more reliable than finding the absolute ( corrected ) binding energy of Ag 3d5/2  Another advantage of the MAP is that it does not depend on the sample charge shift and so one avoids a charge correction of the spectrum  which can be misleading due to the existence of substrate/overlayer contact potentials or differential charges  However  it is still practically impossible to distinguish Ag2O from AgO  especially when the oxides occur simultaneously [ 42 ]  Figures 6 and 7 show high-resolution XPS spectra of Ag 3d and Ag MNN envelopes in the analysed samples  In the simplified deconvolution procedure  only two species of silver were hypothetically assumed  ie  Ag oxides ( AgO and Ag2O ) and metallic Ag  shifted relative to each other by 08 ± 005 eV [ 41 ]  Fig  6 figure 6 Narrow XPS

7 Narrow XPS scans of Ag 3d ( a ) and Ag MNN ( b ) region for La075Ag025FeO3/FeCrAl catalyst freshly prepared and heat-treatment at 700 °C for 1 h  analysed in as-received form and after Ar+ sputtering ( c ) Full size image In the case of La075Ag025FeO3 powders heat-treatment at 700 °C for 50 h  the calculated values of MAP  ie  MAP1 ( 3d5/2—M4N45N45 ) and MAP2 ( 3d5/2—M5N45N45 )  amounted to 7242 and 7187 eV  respectively ( Fig  6 ) as well as narrow Ag 3d5/2 ( FWHM 17 eV ) peak clearly indicated the silver to be in the oxidized homogenous form [ 42 ]  Its binding energy amounted to 3679 eV and was assigned to AgO  However  the best fit was achieved by assuming the presence of small amounts of metallic Ag that can occur under the silver oxide layer  In fact  moderate Ar+ sputtering revealed that the thin AgxO film covered Ag0 crystallites since  after the sputtering  the fraction of metallic silver in the Ag 3d spectrum increased from about 6 to 23 %  The above procedure for interpreting Ag 3d spectra was also applied to the surface of the fresh La075Ag025FeO3/FeCrAl catalyst heated at 700 °C for 1 h just before the sample was put into the UHV chamber  Additionally  in this case  the values of MAP1 and MAP2  amounting to 718 and 724 eV  respectively  unequivocally indicated the dominant presence of AgxO on the catalyst ’ s surface ( Fig  7 )  But the Ag M4N45N45 and Ag M5N45N45 peaks were not as well separated from each other as in Fig  6  which indicated greater heterogeneity of the Ag forms  including a larger fraction of Ag0  The percentage of Ag0/Agtotal on the as-received surface ( evaluated based on the deconvolution of the Ag 3d spectra )  amounted to about 34 %  after sputtering this percentage increased to 43 %  Based on the Ag 3d and Ag MNN spectra and the elemental analyses ( Table 4 )  one can conclude that the heat-treatment of La075Ag025FeO3 powder for 50 h and the catalyst made of this powder for 20 h at 700 °C resulted in an increase in the amount of Ag incorporated into the structure of the perovskite  Some of the silver probably underwent sintering/agglomeration  This is confirmed by XRD analyses  showing that the amount of Ag0 decreased after heat-treatment of the La075Ag025FeO3 perovskite for 50 h ( Fig  1 )  The shapes of the Fe spectra of all the analysed samples were very similar to each other  In the Fe 2p spectra ( Fig  8 ) two distinct peaks at binding energies of ∼ 7104 eV for Fe 2p3/2 and ∼ 7239 eV for Fe 2p1/2 with a shakeup satellite at ~ 7189 eV are observed  That latter peak corresponds to the characteristic of Fe3+ ions in their oxide form  Fig  8 figure 8 Fe 2p core level XPS spectra of La075Ag025FeO3 powders : freshly prepared ( a )  heat-treatment at 700 °C for 50 h ( b )  La075Ag025FeO3/FeCrAl catalyst after 20 h of work at 690–700 °C ( c ) Full size image The La 3d doublets located at 8340 and 8508 eV ( the spectra are not included ) were ascribed to the La–O bonds of 3d5/2 and 3d3/2  Each of the doublets was further split into two components  due to the charge transfer from the ligand 2p level to the La 4f level  The spin–orbit splitting gap of ∼ 168 eV between 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 peaks is also indicative of the La3+ state [ 44 ]  32 Catalyst Activity Testing 321 Activity of the Catalysts in Methane Oxidation The investigations have shown that the substitution of some of the La3+ in LaFeO3 with Ag+ results in an increase in the perovskite ’ s activity in methane oxidation  The test results presented in Fig  9a and in Table 5 show that when the silver content in the La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskite is increased from 005 mol to 025 mol  the catalyst ’ s activity increases and the temperature of methane conversion over the catalyst goes down  Even when as little as 005 mol of the lanthanum is substituted with silver  T10 and T50 are lower by 18 and 8 °C  respectively  in comparison to the catalyst without silver  containing 159 wt % LaFeO3  A marked increase in methane oxidation activity  in comparison with the LaFeO3 catalyst  is observed for the catalysts with La08Ag02FeO3 and La075Ag025FeO3 perovskites  The activity of the catalysts with perovskites containing silver is higher even though the La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskite content in the catalyst is over 3 wt % lower ( 122–129 wt % ) than the LaFeO3 content ( 159 wt % )  Additionally  the activity of all the catalysts with perovskites La1−xAgxFeO3x = 005–025 is distinctly higher than that of the catalyst containing 107 wt % LaFeO3  The catalysts with the La075Ag025FeO3 perovskite  containing the largest amount of silver  show the highest activity in methane oxidation ( Fig  9a )  Fig  9 figure 9 Methane conversion over La1−xAgxFeO3x = 0–025 as a function of temperature ( a )  and Arrhenius plots of reaction rates over same samples ( b )  Experimental conditions : methane concentration 1 % vol  in air  GHSV 5800 h−1 ( based on total monolith volume )  atmospheric pressure Full size image Table 5 Temperatures at light-off ( T10 )  50 % ( T50 ) and 90 % ( T90 ) conversion of methane and hexane over monolithic La1−xAgxFeO3x = 0–025 perovskite catalysts Full size table In order to determine the apparent activation energy of the methane oxidation reaction over the particular perovskites  the ln [ −ln ( 1 − α ) ] = ( 1000/T ) dependence  where α is the conversion of methane and T is the catalyst temperature  was plotted ( Fig  9b ) [ 7  14 ]  The values of apparent activation energy ( Ea ) were calculated from the Arrhenius equation based on the slope of the plotted straight line  Ea for methane oxidation over the LaFeO3 catalyst is 1066 kJ/mol  Silver addition to LaFeO3 perovskite lowers the Ea to about 915–912 kJ/mol for x = 02 and 025 ( Table 5 )  This indicates that the introduced silver has a considerable influence on methane oxidation over the catalysts tested  The specific surface of the perovskites does not contribute to the increase in the activity of the La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites as the Ag content is increased since for the perovskites containing 005–025 mol of Ag this surface is similar  amounting to 52–56 m2/g ( Table 1 )  The specific surface of the perovskites which contain Ag is smaller than that of the LaFeO3 perovskite ( 76 m2/g )  Thus  it can be concluded that the silver introduced into the perovskite enhances its methane oxidation activity  The obtained results show that  for the preparation method used  the solubility of silver in the LaFeO3 perovskite is low  XRD tests showed that a small amount of Ag0 ( with crystallites 31–41 nm in size ) is already present apart from the perovskite phase in La1−xAgxFeO3 at x ≥ 01  Additionally  the mapping of the surface of the catalyst containing La075Ag025FeO3 shows that silver precipitations are present on the surface of the perovskite layer  Other researchers point to the low solubility of silver in LaMO3 perovskites  where M = Mn  Co  Fe [ 4  15  22232425 ]  XPS tests show that the metallic silver present on the surface of La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites  x = 01  015  025  is coated with a thin film of AgxO  which suggests that Ag0 undergoes superficial oxidation during perovskite preparation  This is confirmed by TPR tests which showed that in La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites  x = 015  025  only 10–12 % of the total silver is in the form of Ag2O  More than 988 % of the total silver is stabilized in a metallic state or incorporated into the perovskite lattice  Ag2O decomposes to Ag0 at the temperature of 230–330 °C [ 15 ]  ie  at a temperature lower than that at which the oxidation of methane and hexane was conducted  At the above temperatures  the Ag2O coating the surface of Ag0 decomposes and metallic silver is present in the catalysts  favourably affecting their activity  The Ag0 covered by a stable surface oxygen species appears to be the active phase at methane oxidation  Large Ag0 crystallites 31–41 nm in size were found ( XRD ) to be present in the La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites  The size of the Ag crystallites increases from 31 nm ( x = 005 ) to 41 nm ( x = 025 ) ( Table 1 ) with the silver content in the perovskite  The simultaneous increase in the activity of the catalysts is evidence of the high activity of the large crystallites of Ag0  Similar results were obtained by Buchneva et al  [ 5 ] for LaCoO3 perovskite with an Ag addition  They found that large silver crystallites led to weak Ag–O bond and increase oxygen mobility out of the crystal lattice  causing catalyst activity increases  Small silver crystallites strongly bind oxygen  which makes its participation in the oxidation reaction difficult and lowers the activity of the perovskite [ 45 ]  The introduction silver to the LaFeO3 perovskite increases the amount of oxygen desorbed from the perovskite ’ s surface  The O2-TPD profiles of La1−xAgxFeO3x = 0–025 show that the amount of oxygen desorbed from the LaFeO3 perovskite after silver is introduced into it increases from 31 µmol/g for LaFeO3 to 103 and 146 µmol/g for La085Ag015FeO3 and La075Ag025FeO3 ( Table 3 )  This indicates an increase in active surface oxygen species that can take part in the oxidation of hydrocarbons  and an increase in oxygen mobility out of the perovskite  significantly enhancing the effectiveness of hydrocarbon oxidation  Additionally  Choudhary et al  [ 1  2 ] found that the substitution of La with Ag in LaMO3  where M = Co  Mn  Ni  Fe  and LaFe05Co05O3 perovskites increases the reactivity of the perovskite ’ s lattice oxygen at a low temperature  As a result  pure methane oxidation takes place over 30 pulses of the pulse-reaction despite the absence of oxygen in the gaseous phase  The operating stability of the most active monolithic catalyst with the La075Ag025FeO3 perovskite was tested in methane oxidation at a temperature of about 690–700 °C for 50 h During the first 14 h of catalyst operation  the conversion of methane gradually decreased from 100 % at 670 °C to 97–99 % at 690 °C and remained at this level to the end of the test ( Supplementary material Fig  S4 )  After the 50 h long operation of the La075Ag025FeO3 catalyst at 690 °C  T50 and T90 increased by 18 and 19 °C  respectively  in relation to the fresh catalyst ( Table 5 )  But the activity of this catalyst was still higher than the initial activity of the LaFeO3 perovskite catalysts without any silver addition and the activity of fresh catalysts with La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites  x = 005  01 and 015 ( Table 5 )  The XRD  XPS and TPR tests show a reduction in the amount of metallic silver after the heat-treatment of the La075Ag025FeO3 perovskite at 700 °C for 50 h This may indicate an increase in the amount of silver incorporated into the perovskite ’ s structure  However  a reduction in the amount of Ag0 in the perovskite can be one of the causes of the decrease in the catalyst ’ s activity  322 Activity of the Catalysts in Hexane Oxidation As shown in Fig  10  the activities of the catalysts with La095Ag005FeO3 and LaFeO3 perovskites for n-hexane oxidation are very similar  which means that the substitution of 005 mol of La with Ag in the LaFeO3 perovskite does not increase its activity  The catalysts with the La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites at x ≥ 01 show distinctly higher activity than the LaFeO3 catalyst  But in the investigated temperature range  only a slight increase in the catalyst activity is visible as the silver content in La1−xAgxFeO3 is further increased from 01 to 025 mol ( Fig  10 )  The T10 and T50 determined for hexane oxidation over the La08Ag02FeO3 catalyst are lower by only 8 °C for the La09Ag01FeO3 catalyst  T90  475 °C and 490 °C  respectively  was more different for these catalysts ( Table 5 )  As a result of the increase in perovskite silver content from 02 to 025 mol  T10 and T50 decrease by 17 °C and 3 °C  respectively  while T90 does not change  The La075Ag025FeO3 catalyst that had oxidized methane at 690–700 °C for 50 h showed the same activity as fresh catalyst up to about 400 °C when tested for hexane oxidation  At higher temperatures  the catalyst ’ s activity is lower than that of fresh catalyst and after catalyst operation  T90 increases by 35 °C  The La1−xAgxFeO3x = 01–025 catalysts are distinctly more active in hexane activation than the LaFeO3 catalyst without Ag ( Fig  10 )  Similar to methane oxidation  in hexane oxidation the Ag0 present outside of the perovskite shows the ability to adsorb oxygen and to increase oxygen mobility out of the crystal lattice while the partial incorporation of the silver into the perovskite ’ s crystal lattice leads to the deformation of its structure  enhancing the perovskite ’ s activity in hexane oxidation  Pecchi et al  [ 4 ] also found that despite the incomplete incorporation of Ag into the structure of La1−xAgxMn09Co01O3 perovskite the segregating metallic silver phase provides additional active centres in hexane activation  enhancing the catalyst ’ s activity  Fig  10 figure 10 Hexane conversion over La1−xAgxFeO3x = 0–025 as a function of temperature  Experimental conditions : hexane concentration 1500 ppm in air  GHSV 8 900 h −1 ( based on total monolith volume )  atmospheric pressure Full size image 4 Conclusions For the preparation method used  005–01 mol of silver is incorporated into the structure of the LaFeO3 perovskite  At x ≥ 01 some of the silver in the La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskite remains in the form of large crystals of metallic silver ( XRD ) coated with a thin film of silver oxide AgxO ( XPS  TPR )  The introduction of silver into the LaFeO3 perovskite enhances its activity in oxidation methane and n-hexane  The catalysts with La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites show higher activity in n-hexane oxidation at x ≥ 01 and higher activity in methane oxidation at x ≥ 005 than the LaFeO3 catalyst  The activity of the La1−xAgxFeO3 catalysts in the two processes increases as the Ag content increases from 005 to 025 mol  The increase in the catalysts ’ activity after the introduction of Ag into the LaFeO3 perovskite is due to changes taking place in the perovskite after some of the Ag is incorporated in its structure  Metallic silver in the form of large crystals ( 31–41 nm in size ) also plays a major role  increasing the mobility of oxygen from the crystal lattice and total amount of oxygen desorbed from the surface of the catalyst  Monolithic catalysts containing La1−xAgxFeO3 perovskites are potential materials to be used in industrial processes such as exhaust gas clean up

additive Article 16 February 2024 Introduction The interest of power conversion from light source has been on the rise over the years as an alternative energy generation technology since it is considered as natural  renewable  clean  safe as well as free from negative side impacts to human and nature  Even though current photovoltaic market is dominated by first generation silicon solar cell by 80–90 % with highest recorded efficiency at Standard Test Condition ( STC ) above 25 % [ 1  2 ]  second generation Thin Film solar cell is rapidly approaching behind at current highest efficiency based on STC positioning CIGS and CdTe based thin film at 226 and 221 %  respectively [ 3 ]  Even with the advantages of first generation solar cell  the production cost is still higher that the other generations and 50 % of the cost is originated from the price of the silicon wafer itself [ 4 ]  In contrast to silicon solar cell  lesser material is needed to produce thin film solar cell and the production of thin films does not require complicated processing steps as compared to silicon solar cell  The production cost is much lower and this is one of the main advantages for this technology to outrun the existing solar cell technology [ 5 ]  Currently  ongoing research for thin film absorber material is much focusing on CdTe solar cells considering these materials permits high-efficiency and stability [ 6 ] ; however  due to the fact that limited availability and rising cost of Te with projected demand for PV module is high [ 7 ]  a new material as an absorber layer is needed to replace these material  From the concept of thin film  in 1991  Michael Graetzel introduced the architecture of Dye Sensitized Solar Cell ( DSSC ) and it is categorized into third generation solar cell  Similar to the thin film solar cell  DSSC also possess several advantages that is closing the gaps between existing silicon solar cell technology such as low-manufacturing cost  eco-friendliness  availability  and simple manufacturing requirements  Other than the architecture of ‘ Dye ’ and ‘ Sensitizer ’ in DSSC  the difference between DSSC and thin film solar cell is the involvement of redox couple to assist the light-power conversion  While there are researches focusing on the stability of DSSC [ 8 ]  other research groups are also focusing on the fabrication technique [ 9  10 ]  material for counter electrode [ 11  12 ] and alternative material for the sensitizer to improve its explicitly  such as CdS  Ag2S  CdTe  CdHgTe  InAs  PbS  TiO2  ZnO and carbon-based species [ 13 ]  The incorporation of perovskite material into DSSC as the sensitizer layer marks the beginning of Perovskite Solar Cell ( PSC ) advancement and it is a promising technology for future power generation from solar irradiation  PSC has attracted interest from many researchers due to its ease of fabrication steps  low-cost starting material  high-efficiency and able to outperform DSSC as well as conventional solar cells  Figure 1a shows the introduction of perovskite material in DSSC where it functions as a replacement for the dye sensitizer for the mesoporous TiO2 layer  In this type of architecture  the working concept is the same with normal DSSC where it is by redox couple and recorded efficiency is 97 % [ 14 ]  The incorporation of perovskite material in DSSC is almost similar to the concept of quantum dot ( QD ) solar cell [ 15 ]  Fig  1 figure 1 Incorporation of perovskite material from the earliest cell design ( a DSSC ) to existing design ( d Perovskite solar cell ) [ 14 ] Full size image Previous study had fabricated a non-sensitized PSC using mesoporous Al2O3 to support the perovskite layer [ 16 ]  The unique criteria of perovskite material can be observed in this study with the solar cell structure as in Fig  1b  where it was proven that the electron was not injected into the Al2O3 layer  instead it is transported through the perovskite layer to the electrode layer  This is due to the higher electron mobility in perovskite compared to Al2O3 layer  at 25 and 75 cm2V−1S−1  respectively [ 16 ]  Based on this observation  two preliminary conclusions were outlined ; electron transportation is possible in the perovskite material and it is not necessary to include electron transport material ( ETM ) in PSC [ 14 ]  This is where the cell structure of PSC leads to planar perovskite solar cells as in Fig  1d  The planar design allowed the PSC to be fabricated without the TiO2 layers which requires annealing at high temperature  Nevertheless  some research group still employs the mesoscopic perovskite solar cells ( Fig  1c ) due to the reported disadvantages of planar architecture which includes high-density of trap states and more severe hysteresis phenomenon compared to the mesoscopic perovskite solar cells [ 17 ]  Planar architecture PSC was then further developed into inverted structure  In inverted structure  we would observe the order of electrodes is flipped into p-i-n junction and hole transport layer ( HTM ) is deposited before the perovskite material [ 18 ]  It was reported that the inverted design had allowed facile and cost-effective of fabrication [ 18 ]  This review  however  will be focusing towards the mesoporous PSC and planar PSC  Planar PSC can be processed at low temperature  due to the absence of high temperature processed TiO2  has been able to achieve high power conversion efficiency close to mesoporous PSC [ 19  20 ]  Nevertheless  previous study had overcome the high temperature processed TiO2 by employing atomic layer deposition of TiO2 layers with low temperature plasma [ 21 ]  This development had enable the fabrication of PSC devices on a flexible plastic substrate and showed that mesoporous PSC can possibly be produced without the high temperature annealing process  Despite the advantages of PSC  there are several drawbacks of this architecture  One of the most concerning is the cell ’ s efficiency and stability  Since solar cell is considered as a waste of electrical and electronic equipment [ 22 ]  it is important to consider stability issues to commercialize this technology  Very few stability studies have been conducted to date [ 23 ]  It can be shown directly from the graph obtained from NREL where researchers worldwide are trying to increase the efficiency of PSC from 38 % ( 2009—Toin University ) to 211 % [ 3  24 ]  More and more researches is ongoing as this paper was completed  However  this yearly highest recorded efficiency for PSC that is recognized by NREL is so far involves lead-based material  The first recorded PSC with power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) at 38 % is lead-based material [ 24 ]  As for KRICT in their 2013  2014  and 2015 record  they are using lead-based Perovskite material [ 3 ]  the only difference between these record-breaking PSC is the fabrication process  Details about this fabrication process are yet to be published by them  Research by Oxford University in 2013 is also lead-based material  Research that incorporates lead-based PSC have been shown by many as shown in Table 1  this table eventually shows the current prospects of PSC research and it focus on the absorber material and some other parts in PSC were also considered  Their efficiency was at very satisfying level  but seldom address the issue of environmental impact that can be caused by the device  Table 1 Some of the recent research activities on PSC that involve lead-based material Full size table The toxicity issues due to lead had also been a major obstacle to commercial application of perovskite solar cells  There are complications associated with the environment and human health when lead-based materials are used in perovskite solar cells  Human exposure to lead can cause brain malfunction  premature infants and low birth rate  circulatory system damage and kidneys malfunctioning  Not only to humans  lead can also cause negative impacts to the environment as well as aquatic life  Current situations have urged researchers to focus on obtaining record-breaking efficiency of PSC  but without seriously addressing the environmental impact that lead can cause  Lead-free PSC will be undeniably crucial if this technology is to be commercialized and to compete with existing PV technologies  As current publications have address the toxicity issue of lead [ 23  44454647 ]  increasing number of researchers have attempt to find suitable replacement of lead in PSC [ 484950 ]  Most notably  Sn-based perovskite had been viewed as the most suitable replacement due to its similar chemical nature to Pb as group 14 metal  Nevertheless  the stability issues of Sn with self-doping had limits the development of Sn-based perovskite [ 51 ]  This issue can potentially be managed by adding SnF2 as inhibitor towards the formation of Sn4+ [ 51 ]  Additionally  encapsulation also improves the overall device stability which had been proven to be able to maintain 98 % of its power conversion efficiency over 100 days  Thus  there are huge potential for the development of other materials as replacement for the highly toxic lead to produce lead-free perovskite solar cells with high-efficiency  Cell structure and working mechanism of PSC The common working principle of any existing solar cell is energy absorption from light source  electron–hole separation  charge collection and electron–hole recombination  Although the exact working principle of PSC is not very well understood at the time being [ 46  50 ]  the most simple and reliable explanation is as described by Park et al  in Fig  2 [ 44 ]  Photon with enough energy is emitted onto the PSC surface and its energy is absorbed by the absorber  Electron–hole pair will be produced due to the difference in electric field applied by the electrodes  the electron and hole will be attracted  thus movement of the electron will produce electricity  Fig  2 figure 2 Schematic diagram of working principle for PSC [ 42 ] Full size image Due to the unique advantages of perovskite material which possess the ability to transport electron and hole  as showed by previous study which simulated the possibility of forming a PSC without HTM [ 43 ]  This cell pattern  however  depends on the work function of the back contact with energy of the valence band ( Ev_absorber )  This simulation is further supported experimentally by another literature [ 37 ]  Although HTM-free PSC is possible  several other researchers proved the importance of having a HTM in PSC is rather important and could affect to a positive increment of several outcomes namely PCE  FF  Voc  decreases the internal resistance of the cell as well as increases the electron lifetime thus promoting electron collection and indirectly preventing electron–hole recombination  Material and stability of PSC Initially  perovskite material is used as sensitizer in dye sensitized solar cell ( DSSC ) and it is generally in the form of Organolead Halide  The general formula for perovskite is AMX3  where A is Akyl Ammonia cation ( ex : CH3NH3 )  M is metal cation ( ex : Pb2+ ) and X is Halide Anion ( ex : br-  I− or Cl− )  According to previous research  formability of perovskite material is based on distance ratio between Akylammonia cation–Halide Anion and metal cation–halide anion ( A : X and M : X ) [ 13 ]  This ratio is known as tolerance_factor ( TF ) [ 52 ] and the formula is as below : { mathbf { TF } } =   left ( { R_ { A } +   R_ { B } } right )   /   [ sqrt { 2left ( { R_ { B } + R_ { X } } right ) } ] An ideal perovskite material possess TF = 1  where the molecular structure is perfect cubical  Distorted octahedral is to be expected when TF < 1 and this might affect the electronic properties of the material  Thus  the best material to form PSC is small cation ‘ A ’ that retain ionic radius within the range of 160 Å–250 Å will form Perovskite material  thus  Methylammonia  CH3NH3+ ( 180 Å )  Ethylammonia  CH3CH2NH3+ ( 230 Å ) and Formamidinia  NH2CH=NH2+ ( 190–220 Å ) is found to be the most suitable material [ 15  53 ]  The most common perovskite material currently used is methylammonium lead halide ( CH3NH3PbX3  X=F  Cl  Br or I )  which have suitable optical and electronic properties [ 23 ]  The basic steps to produce this solar active layer are to react PbI2 with CH3NH3I2  Keeping in mind that this reaction is reversible  in one direction is the formation of perovskite film itself and if reversed  is the decomposition to PbI2  The formation of water soluble PbI2 during the decomposition of perovskite material is the main obstacle that prevents commercialization of perovskite solar cells  Other than humidity  UV-light  solution ( perovskite compositions )  oxygen and temperature are among the factors that can cause PSC degradation [ 47  5455565758 ]  Degradation of PSC due to humidity is described in the following chemical reaction [ 45 ] : { text { CH } } _ { 3 } { text { NH } } _ { 3 } { text { PbI } } _ { 3 } left ( { text { S } } right )   leftrightarrow { text { CH } } _ { 3 } { text { NH } } _ { 3 } { text { I } } left ( { text { aq } } right )   + { text { PbI } } _ { 2 } left ( { text { S } } right ) Upon contact with humidity  the hygroscopic methylammonium iodide ( MAI ) is separated from Perovskite crystal and combines with iodine forming aqueous MAI and solid PbI2  In further reaction with humidity  MAI will subsequently decompose to aqueous methylamine  CH3NH3 ( aq ) and hydriodic acid  HI ( aq ) : { text { CH } } _ { 3 } { text { NH } } _ { 3 } { text { I } } _ { { } } left ( { text { aq } } right )   leftrightarrow { text { CH } } _ { 3 } { text { NH } } _ { 2 } left ( { text { aq } } right )   + { text { HI } } _ { 2 } left ( { text { aq } } right ) In contact with oxygen  HI will degrade and produce H2O and I2 as below equation : 4 { text { HI } } left ( { text { aq } } right )   + { text { O } } _ { 2 } left ( { text { g } } right ) leftrightarrow { text { 2I } } _ { 2 } left ( { text { s } } right )   + { text { 2H } } _ { 2 } { text { O } } Should the photochemical reaction with UV took place ; the reaction will proceed as below : 2 { text { HI } } left ( { text { aq } } right )   leftrightarrow { text { H } } _ { 2 } left ( { text { g } } right )   + { text { I } } _ { 2 } left ( { text { s } } right ) In addition of humidity  UV-light  solution ( perovskite compositions )  oxygen and temperature  other related factors were also discovered to affects the solar cells stability  Previous research has found that storage conditions also have an influence over perovskite solar cells stability [ 59 ]  Dry air was found to be the most suitable storage atmosphere ( during the drying process of HTM ) if Spiro-OMeTAD act as the HTM in the cell  Solar device architecture also eventually affects the cells stability  Jose and co-workers found that scaffold structured electron transport layer ( ETL ) produces better stability than planar structured layer [ 60 ]  These two devices  Planar and Scaffold ( Fig  3 )  were compared in the same controlled atmosphere  Fig  3 figure 3 Planar type cell ( a ) and Scaffold type cell ( b ) [ 40 ] Full size image In another study  different ETMs ; Spiro-OMeTAD  NiO  CuI  CuSCN and Cu2O  were compared for the most outstanding result with different thickness setting for ETM  absorber layer as well as HTM [ 32 ]  It was understood that humidity can cause degradation of PSC  However  using Cu2O as the ETM  it was observed that cell degradation caused by moisture can be avoided while maintaining high electron mobility  Cells with Cu2O outperform every other ETM  Recent study has also added reduced graphene oxide ( rGO ) /mesoporous ( mp ) -TiO2 nanocomposite based mesostructured perovskite solar cells [ 61 ]  The study had demonstrated the improvement in electron transport property and photon conversion efficiency which is contributed by the reduction in resistance at interface  Recent study has improved the performance and stability issue of PSC by crystal crosslinking with alkylphosphonic ( butylphosphonic ) acid ω-ammonium chlorides ( 4-ABPACI ) [ 62 ]  Through one-step solution processing  spin-coating ( which in authors opinion  this is the easiest and most favourable way to fabricate PSC in which  if this method is proved success in producing high-efficiency and high stability PSC would take this technology a wide step forward in commercializing PSC )  this team modified the surface of Methylammonium Lead Triiodide in the presence of alkylphosphonic acid ω-ammonium chlorides as the crosslink between neighbouring grains in the perovskite structure  4-ABPACI act not only to increase the cells efficiency from 88 to 167 %  but also enhancing its stability against moisture  Using XRD spectra before and after moisture test ( comparing Pristine and 4-ABPACI deposited on mp-TiO2/FTO )  Pristine cells suffer from severe corrosion compared to 4-ABPACI cells  Other moisture barrier such as carbon cathode or Al2O3 is also quite suitable ; however  it might be not suitable enough for widespread and long term stability  more extensive stabilizer is required  Encapsulation method has also been proven to be able to influence the stability of PSC  When two encapsulation techniques were compared  it was demonstrated that stability of PSC fabricated with encapsulation adopted from organic light emitting diode ( OLED ) technology was able to yield improved stability under high humidity environments compared to typical UV curable epoxy resin method [ 63 ]  It was stated that the OLED method uses a desiccant material that absorbs water that may penetrate through the epoxy resin sealant  Wang and co-workers said that in order for thin film solar cell to be fully commercialized  it is important that it complies with IEC 61646 testing standard which refers to environmental stability  which is at current research finding  this is the big thing to be solved [ 64 ]  In their paper  they address the stability issue based on the whole cell structure including the perovskite material itself  ETM and HTM layers  buffer layer as well as both of the electrodes  However  they stress more on the importance of the encapsulation layer while maintaining lead-based Perovskite material  Using lead-based perovskite is undeniably attractive due to high PCE as shown by many ( as shown in Table 1 )  Nevertheless  controlling the stability only from the encapsulation will only reduce several percent of ecotoxicity from lead as the demand for lead is still available  which means the processing of lead is still exist  From authors ’ point of view  the best method to tackle this problem is to find a suitable replacement for lead to be used in PSC  The above arguments can be supported by previous research [ 65 ]  For the first time  their team had reported the life cycle assessment ( LCA ) on ecotoxicity of PSC  Fabrication is based on two most successive reported articles on fabricating PSC that is Vapour Phase Deposition and Solution Processing  They concluded that the major contributor to negative environmental effect comes from the manufacturing process itself  The electricity required to fabricate the cell is the main arguments for this paper  and this by all means covers vapour and solution deposition  The only difference is the percentage of contribution between these two processing methods  Additionally  the life cycle impact analysis revealed that in both deposition processes  the impact was focused primarily on the human toxicity ( cancer effect ) and freshwater ecotoxicity  which is due to lead emission [ 65  66 ]  However  the article suggested that PSC technology does not pose concern in its raw materials extraction  synthesis of the starting materials and manufacture of the PSC as compared to the other solar cell technologies  In another LCA  the research focuses on the difference of TiO2 module and ZnO module for PSC [ 67 ]  The study found that both PSC modules have the shortest energy payback time compared to the other solar cell technologies while emphasizing on reducing the high energy demand processes to lower the CO2 emission factor  Lead-free perovskite solar cell Albeit the high-performance of PSCs with relatively high stability [ 68 ]  the presence of lead has been taken into caution by the many researchers  The usage of such material has caused a relative concern due to obey strict requirement to be environmental friendly which hindered the large-scale implementation of perovskite solar cells  The main concern is circulated upon the possibility of solar modules would somehow crack under environmental hazards such as hail or earthquake  and thus releasing the degraded perovskite products into the environment [ 69 ]  Previous study had argued that the Pb content in PSC could deter market acceptance due to its risk towards human health and ecosystem [ 70 ]  To such extent  researchers are in the effort to replace Pb with other suitable materials to alleviate the toxicity issues in PSCs [ 7172737475 ]  Suitable materials which have been proposed so far includes tin ( Sn )  bismuth ( Bi )  germanium ( GE ) and copper ( Cu ) [ 76 ]  Table 2 summarizes the main research on lead-free perovskite and their performance  Table 2 Research on lead free perovskite and its performance Full size table Sn has been considered as a suitable substitution for Pb in perovskite solar cells due to their similarity in chemical properties [ 48  49 ]  The use of Sn-based perovskite has been implemented in transistor with excellent charge motilities [ 88 ]  The application of Sn in perovskite solar cells usually involved the alloying of Sn/Pb with the recent study recording a 15 % efficiency in oxygen deficient environment as well as in tandem applications [ 77  899091 ]  Ogomi et al  was one of the first to vary the composition of Pb : Sn ratio and tested the performance of perovskite solar cells [ 78 ]  They had proved the possibility of Sn could be a possible option as the absorber material for solar cells  but also showed that pure Sn perovskite solar cells did not produce any photovoltaic performance  It was also demonstrated that Sn would able to intrinsically maintain its 2 + oxidation state with the presence of Pb in the absorber layer  Nevertheless  Snaith et al  has fabricated a totally Pb-free perovskite solar cells using MASnI3 as the perovskite light absorber with encapsulation and in nitrogen environment glovebox to prevent the degradation of the Sn-based perovskite absorber [ 49 ]  The study also mentioned the stability issues of Sn-based perovskite where a discoloration was observed within seconds after the absorber layer was exposed to the ambient atmosphere due to the intrinsic property of Sn2+ to oxidise rapidly to Sn4+ in the presence of oxygen [ 69 ]  However  fabrication of a complete cell was successful while in the nitrogen environment  Despite the stability issues  the study also mentioned the possibility of Pb-free perovskite to be employed in perovskite solar cells with toxicology advantage over the Pb-based perovskite solar cells  In comparison towards Pb-based perovskite absorber  a research has compared the properties ( crystal structure  optical properties and charge transporting properties ) of Pb-based and Sn-based of methylammonium ( MA ) and formamidinium ( FA ) halide perovskite  respectively [ 92 ]  It was demonstrated that the band gaps were ranging from 11 to 17 eV and showed excellent photoluminescence properties suitable for solar cell applications  Although the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ was also observed here  improved stability with high electron and hole motilities was recorded which shown potential towards Pb-free absorber layer  When Pb and Sn is applied simultaneously ( MAPb1-xSnxI3 ) in the absorber layer  it was found out that the band gap values do not behave consistently with the increase in substitution rate [ 79 ]  At low concentration of Sn  the band gap decreases  then minimum band gap value at x = 05 and 075  and lastly increases to 130 V when Pb-free perovskite was tested  When the perovskite solar cells were fabricated  lead-free device was performing at 544 % efficiency compared to Pb-based device at 831 %  Additionally  it was mention that since the absorber layer showed activation towards near-IR region  it can be beneficial in both single junction and in tandem architecture where the band gap is required to be near 1 eV [ 93 ]  On the other hand  investigation on mixed halide Sn-based perovskite MASnxI3-xBrx showed an increasing energy band gap values towards higher Br-content ( 130–215 eV ) [ 48 ]  Figure 4a shows the mesoscopic structure of the solar cell device with the colour change in different absorber layers on the right panel  It was stated that the lighter colours of the larger band gaps are attributed by the narrowed light absorption range of the absorber ( Fig  4b )  It was reported that the higher Br-content absorber possess higher open circuit voltage ( Voc ) and a lower short-circuit photocurrent density ( Jsc )  Most importantly  the spontaneous decomposition of the absorber layer were reported with 36 % reduction in performance while stored in nitrogen environment and encapsulated  Fig  4

energy-level diagram of CH3NH3SnI3-xBrx with TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD HTM Full size image In addition to MA and FA halide perovskite absorbers  Cs halide perovskite have also been investigated with Sn to study their compatibility [ 80  81 ]  With lower energy bandgap of 13 eV  the CsSnI3 perovskite absorber could harvest light at near-IR region and possess short-circuit photocurrent density of 343 mAcm−2  It was mentioned that the metallic nature of the CsSnI3 was alleviated by doping with 20 % SnF2 by reducing the background carrier density [ 80 ]  Organolead halide perovskite have also been investigated in inverted planar structure solar cells  with the usage of fullerene and its derivatives for the electron transporting layer  instead of inorganic metal oxide [ 949596 ]  The incorporation of Sn has been reported by a study employing a structure of ITO/CuI/CsSnI3/C60/BCP/Al [ 82 ]  The study also demonstrated the improvement in stability and performance using excess amount SnI2 during the synthesis of CsSnI3  The excess amount of SnI2 is postulated to be able to minimize the Sn vacancy defects of the tin-halide perovskite which contributes to the metallic nature of Sn  Low temperature processing was utilized in the fabrication of solar cell devices with inverted planar structure of ITO/PEDOT : PSS/FASnI2Br/C60/Ca/Al [ 83 ]  With a combination of FASnI2Br ( bandgap of 168 eV ) and low temperature annealing ( 75 °C )  a power conversion efficiency of 172 % was achieved with maintaining more than 60 % performance efficiency after 30 h in nitrogen environment  Ge-based perovskite have shown some potential as the absorber layer for photovoltaic solar cells based on density functional theory [ 97 ]  The study had prepared a series of Ge-based perovskite using Cs  MA  FA  acetamidinium  guanidinium  trimethylammonium  and isopropylammonium  to evaluate their potential as a perovskite absorber layer  It was demonstrated that these materials possess slightly higher bandgaps that the Pb counterparts  however  the problem of material stability is also present  It was demonstrated that the Ge-based perovskite performance in Voc was poor and the recorded efficiency was only 02 % [ 84 ]  Cu-based perovskite have also received attention due to its stability in air [ 98  99 ]  Compared to the 3D perovskites  Cu-based perovskite are 2D with multi quantum-well electronic structure  presenting particular electronic  magnetic and dielectric properties [ 85  88  98  100 ]  A study had fabricated Cu-based solar cells using ( CH3CH2CH2CH2NH3 ) 2CuBr4 and ( F-C8H8NH3 ) 2CuBr4  with power conversion efficiency of 063 and 051 %  respectively [ 98 ]  A study was focusing on the Br/Cl ratio to tune the light adsorption properties of Cu-based perovskite [ 99 ]  The study had postulated that the poor power conversion efficiency obtained was contributed by low absorption coefficient and heavy mass for the holes  Bi-based perovskite  A3Bi2X9 has attracted considerable attention due to its interesting properties [ 72  86  87  101102103104 ]  Bi-based perovskite have excellent stability towards moisture and less toxic compared to Pb-based perovskite  The 0D perovskite is formed due to bioctahedral ( Bi2I9 ) 3− clusters and the surrounding cations  as shown in Fig  5  Previous study has demonstrated the stability of MA3Bi2I9 in ambient environment for more than 40 days [ 72 ]  Nevertheless  the performance efficiency was sub-par with conventional structure ( 019 % ) and inverted planar structure ( 01 % ) [ 86  87 ]  On the other hand  Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite had performed slightly better at 109 % efficiency [ 72 ]  The performance of Bi-based perovskite is not as high as its Pb counterparts  Nevertheless  its potential as a less toxic alternative with high stability is expected to present some improvement in performance efficiency in the near future  Fig  5 figure 5 Schematic diagram of Bi-based perovskite ( Cs3Bi2I9 ) Full size image Conclusion and future prospect In conclusion  this review concerns the material stability of Pb-based perovskite and the alternative replacement for Pb-based perovskite in photovoltaic solar cells  In the effort to manage the material instability of Pb-based perovskite  researcher often opt for improving fabrication technique or simply replace the Pb-based perovskite with alternative material  Although several materials have been proposed  most of them either still possess some extend of stability or inherently produce low performance efficiency  Developing suitable encapsulation technique may be relevant towards enhancing perovskite resistivity towards moisture  Material selection at the ETM and HTM may also contribute to a higher performance efficiency  Although the performance efficiency of Pb-alternative perovskite is still relatively low  the study is still at its infancy  Progress is expected at this study due to the less toxic with high stability perovskite available  Research output are expected towards this aim which may transform perovskite solar cells toward a truly green  highly stable and low-cost photovoltaic solar

with HCl as an additive Article 16 February 2024 1 Introduction The investigation of inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite solar cells is of major interest since its massive increase in power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) from 38 % [ 1 ] in 2009 to 221 % in 2016 [ 2 ]  The highest PCEs so far were achieved in n-i-p device architectures  using mesoporous TiO2 as electron transport layer ( ETL ) and spiro-OMeTAD as hole transport layer ( HTL )  respectively [ 3 ]  Recently  Saliba et al  introduced a triple cation perovskite  using a combination of methylammonium  formamidinium and cesium ions ( MA/FA/Cs ) and a mixture of bromide and iodide reaching PCE values of more than 20 % together with enhanced device stability  Maximum PCEs of 211 % and 2096 % were reached with a Csx ( MA017FA083 ) ( 100−x ) Pb ( I083Br017 ) 3 perovskite absorber layer where x = 5 and 10  respectively  This A-site cation combination results in the suppression of the photovoltaic non-active “ yellow phase ” and enhances perovskite crystallinity  However  so far this route is mainly investigated in n-i-p based perovskite solar cells [ 456 ]  In these structures  TiO2 is used as ETL in most cases in combination with HTLs such as spiro-OMeTAD or other organic HTLs [ 7 ]  Despite reaching high efficiencies  commonly high temperature processing is required for the preparation of the compact and mesoporous TiO2 films limiting low cost and energy efficient fabrication  Compared to the n-i-p device structures containing mesoporous TiO2  p-i-n planar devices offer low temperature fabrication  which is favourable for roll-to-roll fabrication [ 8  9 ]  In p-i-n perovskite devices  usually PCBM is used as ETL and poly ( 34-ethylenedioxythiophene ) polystyrene sulfonate ( PEDOT : PSS ) as HTL  However  due to its acidic nature and hygroscopic character  devices with PEDOT : PSS layers might degrade faster than devices with eg  NiOx hole transport layers  which have a similar valence band energy as PEDOT : PSS films [ 1011121314 ]  Some research groups also reported better crystallinity of the perovskite film on a NiOx layer than on PEDOT : PSS [ 15  16 ]  NiOx is an inorganic metal oxide semiconductor  which exhibits high optical transmittance  high stability  easy processability  and a wide band gap that allows high hole mobility and good electron blocking ability [ 17  18 ]  There exist several methods for NiOx deposition  like atomic layer deposition  flame spray synthesis  pulsed laser deposition  sputtering and electrodeposition [ 16  19202122 ]  However  for fast and large scale roll-to-roll fabrication  coating or printing processes for the application of the NiOx films are of interest  In this regard  several methods using spin coating followed by an additional annealing step are reported [ 232425 ]  Interestingly  higher temperature treatment of the NiOx films significantly affects the device performance  Jiang et al  reported that annealing NiOx above 150 °C reduces the device performance due to the formation of Ni2O3 species [ 26 ]  A reduction of the device performance was also seen by Hou et al  when heating the NiOx film above 140 °C [ 16 ]  Moreover  it was shown that p-i-n devices with MAPbI3 as absorber layer reveal low to almost negligible hysteresis  especially if NiOx is used as HTL [ 9  27 ]  Recently  a PCE of 184 % for perovskite-based solar cells with a NiOx HTL was reported by Bai et al  who investigated the perovskite crystal growth on NiOx films and the formation of intermediate layers ( MAPbI3-DMSO ) with increasing DMSO concentration [ 25 ]  In this work  we investigate and compare different hole transport layers ( HTLs )  namely solution based NiOx  sputtered NiOx  and PEDOT : PSS  in solar cells using the triple cation lead halide perovskite Cs008 ( MA017FA083 ) 092Pb ( I083Br017 ) 3 as absorber layer in terms of solar cell performance and hysteresis properties of the devices  2 Results and discussion 21 Preparation and characterisation of the hole transport layers The synthesis of the NiOx nanoparticles was adapted from literature [ 9  26  27 ] and is conducted at room temperature with a subsequent drying step at 80 °C and a temperature treatment at 270 °C  which results in non-stoichiometric NiOx [ 26  27 ]  The X-ray diffraction pattern in Fig  1a  shows five distinct reflections at 372°  433°  627°  754° and 794° 2θ which correspond to the lattice planes ( 111 )  ( 200 )  ( 220 )  ( 311 )  and ( 222 ) of NiOx in the cubic crystal structure [ 27 ]  It also indicates that neither Ni ( OH ) 2 nor NaNO3 impurities are present  The primary crystallite size was estimated using the Scherrer equation to be around 8 nm  Fig  1 figure 1 X-ray diffractogram of the NiOx nanocrystals displaying the reflections of cubic NiOx at 372°  433°  627°  754° and 794° 2θ  which match well with the reference PDF 01-078-0429 ( a ) ; X-ray diffractogram of the Cs008 ( MA017FA083 ) 092Pb ( I083Br017 ) 3 perovskite on a glass substrate displaying all characteristic reflections according to Ref  [ 7 ] ( b ) Full size image To prepare NiOx thin films  the nanoparticles were dispersed in deionized water to form a black ink  which was used for spin coating in ambient conditions  After spin casting  the NiOx layers did not undergo further annealing or post-treatment steps  The layer thickness was found to be between 29 and 39 nm  Alternatively  10 nm thick NiOx layers were prepared by sputtering  The NiOx layers were sputtered from an oxide target ( 4-in  in diameter ) using a RF magnetron source at a power of 200 W in an Ar/O2 ( 80/20 ) mixture and a gas pressure of 5 µbar [ 28 ]  PEDOT : PSS layers ( ~ 35 nm ) were prepared by spin coating  In Fig  2a  the transmission spectra of the investigated HTLs are shown  The solution processed NiOx nanoparticle film as well as the PEDOT : PSS film showed high transparency greater than 80 % on indium tin oxide ( ITO ) substrates  Compared to that  the sputtered NiOx film showed less transmission of around 70 %  In sputtering experiments with different Ar/O2 ratios  we found that a higher O2 content ( up to 20 % ) fosters the formation of films with higher transparency  Based on that we assume that the diminished transmission stems most likely from low oxygen content in the sputtered NiOx films  We increased the transmittance of the sputtered NiOx films by an annealing step at 150 °C in ambient conditions  however  in this case problems with the wettability of the perovskite coating solution and consequently with the homogeneity of the perovskite layers occurred  Consequently  non-annealed sputtered NiOx films were used for further experiments  Fig  2 figure 2 a Transmission spectra of glass substrates covered with ITO  ITO/solution processed NiOx  ITO/sputtered NiOx and ITO/PEDOT : PSS ; b Absorption spectrum of the Cs008 ( MA017FA083 ) 092Pb ( I083Br017 ) 3 perovskite on a glass substrate  The precursor solution was 1:4 diluted compared to the precursor used for solar cell fabrication [ solvent : DMF : DMSO ( 1:4 v/v ) ] Full size image 22 Preparation of the triple cation perovskite—Cs008 ( MA017FA083 ) 092Pb ( I083Br017 ) 3 The triple cation perovskite approach incorporating cesium ( Cs )  methylammonium ( MA )  and formamidinium ( FA ) as monovalent cations was adopted from Saliba et al  [ 7 ] and was prepared with a Cs-content of 8 % ( see Sect  4 )  By combining these three different cations ( MA/FA/Cs )  the mixed cation perovskite crystalizes in a cubic crystal structure  which corresponds to a black phase [ 4 ]  In Fig  1b  the X-ray diffractogram of the triple cation perovskite ( prepared on a glass substrate ) shows the typical pattern of the perovskite structure and matches well with literature data [ 7 ]  As can be further seen  no impurities such as lead iodide  methylammonium iodide or FAPbI3 were observed  The addition of Cs fosters the formation of the desired black phase and suppresses the yellow phase of FAPbI3 [ 4 ]  Another important issue is the ratio of the solvent mixture to obtain a uniform film formation  Herein a mixture of DMSO/DMF ( 4/1 v/v ) was used because the strong coordinative solvent DMSO enhances the dissolution of PbI2 [ 29 ]  The perovskite film thicknesses were in the same range ( 280–320 nm ) on all substrates and interfacial layers  The surface morphology of a perovskite film prepared on a glass/ITO/NiOx substrate was investigated by SEM and can be seen in Fig  3a  The top view image indicates homogenous growth on NiOx with complete coverage of the perovskite film without obvious pinholes and grain sizes ranging from ~ 100 to 500 nm  The absorption spectrum ( shown in Fig  2b ) corresponds to the data in the literature [ 4  6 ]  Fig  3 figure 3 Top view SEM image of a perovskite film prepared on a NiOx layer ( a )  a schematic representation of the device structure ( p-i-n type ) used in this study ( b )  and the corresponding energy level diagram : ITO ( − 47 eV ) [ 26 ]  NiOx ( − 549 to − 185 eV ) [ 26 ]  PEDOT : PSS ( − 52 eV ) [ 31 ]  triple cation perovskite ( − 55 to − 388 eV ) [ 6 ]  PC60BM ( − 60 to − 42 eV ) [ 14  32 ] and silver ( Ag ) ( − 44 eV ) [ 22 ] Full size image 23 Device preparation Up to now  Cs—containing mixed ion perovskite solar cells were mostly fabricated in n-i-p device structures on mesoporous TiO2 [ 4  6 ]  In our study  this efficient perovskite absorber is investigated in the planar p-i-n structure adopted from organic solar cells  which already gave promising PCE values with MAPbI3 absorber layers ranging from 10 % to above 18 % [ 8  17  19  25  27  30 ]  A scheme of the used solar cell architecture is depicted in Fig  3b  In a first step  the respective HTL is deposited on glass/ITO substrates  Subsequently  the perovskite absorber layer is coated  followed by the deposition of a 50 nm thick PC60BM layer as ETL  The solar cells were completed by the deposition of silver electrodes with a thickness of approximately 120 nm by thermal evaporation  In Fig  3c  an energy level diagram of the used materials in the solar cells is presented  Compared to PEDOT : PSS ( valence band of − 52 eV )  the valence band ( VB ) of NiOx ( − 549 eV ) is well aligned to the VB of the mixed cation perovskite ( − 550 eV )  NiOx exhibits a high conduction band ( CB ) of − 185 eV whereas the CB of the perovskite is only − 388 eV  which makes NiOx a good electron blocking layer [ 6  9  26  31 ]  PC60BM ( CB : − 42 eV ) acts as electron transport layer in this device configuration [ 14  32 ]  In Fig  4 cross sectional SEM images of the prepared solar cells are displayed  In the images of the devices with a solution processed NiOx HTL depicted in Fig  4a  d  the NiOx nanoparticle films can be clearly seen and the distribution appears inhomogeneous  However  this inhomogeneity most likely does not stem from the spin coating process  but from breaking the device for the analysis of the cross-section  For the devices with PEDOT : PSS hole transport layer ( Fig  4b  e ) a homogenous PEDOT : PSS film with a thickness of around 35 nm was observed  Also the sputtered NiOx layer appears very homogenous in the cross sectional SEM images in Fig  4c  f and the thickness is approx  10 nm  In the cross sections of all devices  the perovskite films reveal a thickness between 280 and 320 nm  On top of the perovskite films  the PC60BM layers  which appear slightly darker  can be distinguished and the devices in ( Fig  4d–f ) are prepared with an additional ZnO nanoparticle layer  The ZnO nanoparticle film is homogenous in all samples  covering the PC60BM film with a layer thickness of around 70–100 nm  Fig  4

with a ZnO interfacial layer ( f ) Full size image In a next step  the film thickness of the solution processed NiOx layer was varied and its influence on the solar cell performance was studied  By changing the spin coating parameters  NiOx layers with thicknesses of 29  34 and 39 nm ( ± 1 nm ) were deposited  Figure 5a shows the current density–voltage ( J–V ) curves of typical devices  Table 1 summarizes the characteristic J–V parameters of these cells  Solar cells with NiOx layers of 29 and 34 nm exhibit very similar device parameters  with VOC values about 095 V  JSC values about 22 mA/cm2 and FF values about 60 % yielding overall PCEs of approx  13 %  In contrast to that  for solar cells with NiOx layers of 39 nm  the JSC values are reduced to about 19 mA/cm2 and the FF to values of 53 % yielding to typical PCEs values of 9 %  The doubling of the series resistance indicates that the NiOx-layer is getting too thick  Other important aspects which have to be taken into account are voids or pinholes that increase in number when the layer thickness of NiOx is decreased [ 33 ]  This is consistent with our findings  The shunt resistance is getting higher with increasing layer thickness  In this regard  the solar cells with 34 nm thick NiOx films showing the highest FF and good VOC and JSC values have been chosen for further optimization  Moreover  the devices are showing only a small hysteresis as can be seen exemplarily in Fig  5b  Fig  5 figure 5 a J–V curves of solar cells with different layer thicknesses of the solution processed NiOx HTL ; b typical J–V

with hollow symbols Full size image Table 1 Characteristic parameters of the solar cells prepared with different thicknesses of the solution processed NiOx HTL Full size table Next  solar cells with sputtered NiOx ( 10 nm ) and PEDOT : PSS as HTL and devices without HTL have been investigated  In Fig  5b  the J–V curves of the best devices are compared with those of solar cells using solution processed NiOx ( 34 nm )  The corresponding device parameters of these solar cells as well as the mean values and the standard deviations are given in Table 2  Compared to the solar cells with the solution processed NiOx HTL  in devices with a sputtered NiOx film  the PCE was reduced from 126 to 83 %  which is mainly due to a significantly lower FF  The reason for the lower FF ( 51 % ) is most likely the low film thickness of the sputtered NiOx film of only 10 nm and thereby insufficient electron blocking properties  With the sputtered NiOx layers  a trade-off needs to be made  On one hand  for thicker NiOx layers  the shunt resistance and electron blocking properties are better  but the series resistance and the absorption losses are high  On the other hand  for thin NiOx layers  the absorption losses are moderate but the shunt resistance and electron blocking properties suffer ( see Table 2 )  The high optical losses are maybe the most critical factor here  which does not come into play for the nanoparticle-based NiOx layer  Table 2 Characteristic parameters of the solar cells with solution processed or sputtered NiOx  PEDOT : PSS  or no HTL Full size table The prepared devices with PEDOT : PSS as HTL show a lower VOC ( 074 V ) compared to NiOx-based devices ( 091–094 V )  As was found by Liu et al  this lower VOC is most likely due to the fact that methylammonium iodide can decrease the intrinsic p-doping in PEDOT : PSS leading to a reduced work function and non-efficient hole collection [ 34 ]  For comparison purposes  we also prepared devices without HTL  Due to the absence of a hole selective contact  the VOC as well as the fill factor in these solar cells are significantly reduced and PCEs of only approx  1 % could be obtained  Regarding the hysteresis behaviour  for solar cells with solution processed or sputtered NiOx HTLs low hysteresis was observed  whereas devices with PEDOT : PSS layers show a more pronounced one  When using no HTL  a strong hysteresis effect could be seen ( Fig  5b )  The J–V curves of solar cells with solution processed and sputtered NiOx as well as PEDOT : PSS HTLs and an additional ZnO nanoparticle interlayer on top of the PC60BM film measured in forward and backward scan direction are depicted in Fig  5c and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 3  Devices using solution processed NiOx as HTL revealed again the highest PCE of 126 % with an average of 125 ± 019 %  In all devices  the FF increased independent of the used HTL  which is attributed to a reduced leakage path and improved hole blocking properties of the ETL  Table 3 Performance of the solar cells with an additional ZnO interfacial layer between the PC60BM layer and the silver electrode Full size table Moreover  by the deposition of the ZnO nanoparticle layer  the hysteresis effect was diminished even further for the solar cells prepared with a solution processed NiOx hole transport layer ( see Fig  5c )  As can be also seen in Fig  5c  the addition of the ZnO interlayer does not have a positive influence on the hysteresis behaviour of the devices with sputtered NiOx or PEDOT : PSS HTLs  3 Conclusion In conclusion  NiOx HTLs led—compared to PEDOT : PSS HTLs—to higher power conversion efficiencies of solar cells with the triple cation lead halide perovskite Cs008 ( MA017FA083 ) 092Pb ( I083Br017 ) 3 as absorber layer  In this study  two types of NiOx HTLs were investigated  whereby solution processed NiOx HTLs  prepared from NiOx nanoparticle inks  performed better than sputtered NiOx films  The lower PCE of the devices with a PEDOT : PSS HTL is mainly due to a decreased VOC and a lower FF  SEM images of the cross sections of the investigated devices revealed similar thicknesses of the perovskite absorber layer ( 280–320 nm ) in all devices and good homogeneity of all layers in the solar cell stack  Furthermore  compared to devices with PEDOT : PSS as HTL  solar cells with a solution processed nanoparticle based NiOx HTL showed very small hysteresis  The incorporation of a ZnO nanoparticle layer as an additional ETL between the PC60BM film and the silver electrode significantly improved the FF of the devices prepared with the different HTLs  4 Experimental details 41 Materials All chemicals and solvents were used as purchased without any further purification

Company  All the other chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich  42 Preparation of ITO substrates Patterned glass/ITO substrates ( 15 × 15 × 11 mm ) ( 10 Ω/sq ) from Xinyan Technology were pre-cleaned with acetone  put in an isopropyl alcohol bath and placed in an ultrasonic bath at 40 °C for 30 min  The substrates were then dried with N2 and further plasma etched for 3 min  43 NiOx nanoparticle synthesis and film formation The nickel ( II ) oxide nanoparticles were synthesized according to literature with small changes [ 9  26  27 ]  Briefly  nickel ( II ) nitrate hexahydrate ( NiNO3·6H2O ) ( 005 mol ) was dispersed in 10 ml deionized water and stirred for 5 min  Afterwards sodium hydroxide ( NaOH  10 M ) was added dropwise to adjust a pH of 10  which results in a colour change from dark to light green  The colloidal precipitate was then washed with deionized water to remove side products  The light green residue was then dried at 80 °C for 6 h and further calcinated at 270 °C for 2 h  resulting in non-stoichiometric black nickel ( II ) oxide nanoparticles  In a next step  the NiOx NPs ( 2 wt % ) were dispersed in deionized water  placed in an ultrasonic bath at 40 °C for 2 h and filtered through a 045 µm PVDF syringe filter to produce the NiOx ink used for thin film formation  The NiOx nanoparticle ink was spin coated at different speeds ( 2500–4500 rpm ) for 30 s and the NiOx films on the glass/ITO substrates were dried at room temperature for 1 h 44 PEDOT : PSS film formation PEDOT : PSS ( P VP AI 4083 ) ( 05 ml ) was mixed with 1 ml isopropyl alcohol  placed in an ultrasonic bath for 1 h and filtered through a 045 µm PVDF syringe filter  The solution was then spin coated in ambient air at 3000 rpm for 60 s followed by drying at 130 °C for 20 min also in ambient air  Afterwards  to increase the wettability of the perovskite solution  the substrates were treated with isopropyl alcohol by placing the substrate on a spin coater  applying 200 µl of isopropyl alcohol on the PEDOT : PSS film followed by a spin coating step ( 2000 rpm for 2 s  4000 rpm for 10 s ) to dry the substrate and an additional annealing step with the same parameters as used before ( 130 °C for 20 min ) [ 30 ]  45 Sputtered NiOx The 4-in  diameter NiOx target was mounted on a RF magnetron source and sputtered at 200 W in Ar/O2 ( 80/20 ) atmosphere  at a pressure of 5 µbar  without substrate heating  The sputtering tool was a Leybold Univex 450C with a base vacuum of 1 × 10−7 mbar  46 Perovskite precursor and film formation The triple cation perovskite precursor was prepared by introducing slight changes in the procedure used by Saliba et al  [ 7 ]  The precursor consisted of lead iodide ( PbI2  11 M )  lead bromide ( PbBr2  02 M )  formamidinium iodide ( FAI  1M )  and methylammonium bromide ( MABr  02 M ) dissolved in a 1:4 ( v/v ) DMF : DMSO solvent mixture  A second solution of cesium iodide ( CsI  15 M ) in DMSO was prepared and added to the first solution to get the desired Cs content of 8 %  The spin coating was carried out in a two-step process at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 6000 rpm for 20 s The spinning substrate was treated with 50 µl chlorobenzene as an anti-solvent during the last 5 s of the spinning process  which allowed the precipitation of the perovskite  The substrates were then annealed at 100 °C for 1 h All steps were carried out inside a glovebox with nitrogen atmosphere  47 Electron transport layer film formation and top electrode A 20 mg/ml solution of PC60BM in chlorobenzene was prepared and stirred for 2 h at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere [ 27 ]  The solution was spin coated at 2000 rpm for 60 s Afterwards  the top electrode ( 120 nm Ag ) was deposited by thermal evaporation under high vacuum conditions ( 1 × 10−5 mbar ) using a shadow mask ( active area of 009 cm2 )  48 Interfacial layer film formation A zinc oxide nanoparticle ink ( purchased from Sigma Aldrich ) was spin coated on the PC60BM layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s without any further treatment under nitrogen atmosphere before the deposition of the silver electrode  49 Characterization The NiOx nanoparticles as well as the triple cation perovskite were characterized by X-ray diffraction with a PANalytical Empyrean system which uses Cu K alpha radiation  UV–Vis measurements of the HTLs were performed using the UV/VIS Spectrometer—Lambda 35 by Perkin Elmer  The layer thicknesses of all HTLs were determined by ellipsometry using a M-2000 instrument ( JA  Woollam Co  USA ) in reflection at incident angles of 65°  70° and 75°  The optical data were recorded in the wavelength range of 370–1000 nm  The experimental data were modeled with the CompleteEASE® software  using a three-layer system consisting of the silicon substrate  the interfacial oxide layer and a Cauchy function with Urbach tail as top layer  The thicknesses of the absorber material and the ETLs were measured by surface profilometry using a DektakXT device by Bruker as well as by cross sectional SEM images acquired on a Zeiss-Supra 40 scanning electron microscope with an in-lens detector  J–V curves of all devices were measured inside a glove box ( nitrogen atmosphere ) with a scan rate of 150 mV/s using a Keithley 2400 source meter connected to a LabView-based software  The light with an irradiation of 100 mW/cm2 was produced by a Dedolight DLH400 lamp  which was calibrated using a pyranometer from Kipp & ZonenInvestigation of NiOx-hole transport layers in triple cation perovskite solar cells Open access Published

hybrid perovskite solar cells is of major interest since its massive increase in power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) from 38 % [ 1 ] in 2009 to 221 % in 2016 [ 2 ]  The highest PCEs so far were achieved in n-i-p device architectures  using mesoporous TiO2 as electron transport layer ( ETL ) and spiro-OMeTAD as hole transport layer ( HTL )  respectively [ 3 ]  Recently  Saliba et al  introduced a triple cation perovskite  using a combination of methylammonium  formamidinium and cesium ions ( MA/FA/Cs ) and a mixture of bromide and iodide reaching PCE values of more than 20 % together with enhanced device stability  Maximum PCEs of 211 % and 2096 % were reached with a Csx ( MA017FA083 ) ( 100−x ) Pb ( I083Br017 ) 3 perovskite absorber layer where x = 5 and 10  respectively  This A-site cation combination results in the suppression of the photovoltaic non-active “ yellow phase ” and enhances perovskite crystallinity  However  so far this route is mainly investigated in n-i-p based perovskite solar cells [ 456 ]  In these structures  TiO2 is used as ETL in most cases in combination with HTLs such as spiro-OMeTAD or other organic HTLs [ 7 ]  Despite reaching high efficiencies  commonly high temperature processing is required for the preparation of the compact and mesoporous TiO2 films limiting low cost and energy efficient fabrication  Compared to the n-i-p device structures containing mesoporous TiO2  p-i-n planar devices offer low temperature fabrication  which is favourable for roll-to-roll fabrication [ 8  9 ]  In p-i-n perovskite devices  usually PCBM is used as ETL and poly ( 34-ethylenedioxythiophene ) polystyrene sulfonate ( PEDOT : PSS ) as HTL  However  due to its acidic nature and hygroscopic character  devices with PEDOT : PSS layers might degrade faster than devices with eg  NiOx hole transport layers  which have a similar valence band energy as PEDOT : PSS films [ 1011121314 ]  Some research groups also reported better crystallinity of the perovskite film on a NiOx layer than on PEDOT : PSS [ 15  16 ]  NiOx is an inorganic metal oxide semiconductor  which exhibits high optical transmittance  high stability  easy processability  and a wide band gap that allows high hole mobility and good electron blocking ability [ 17  18 ]  There exist several methods for NiOx deposition  like atomic layer deposition  flame spray synthesis  pulsed laser deposition  sputtering and electrodeposition [ 16  19202122 ]  However  for fast and large scale roll-to-roll fabrication  coating or printing processes for the application of the NiOx films are of interest  In this regard  several methods using spin coating followed by an additional annealing step are reported [ 232425 ]  Interestingly  higher temperature treatment of the NiOx films significantly affects the device performance  Jiang et al  reported that annealing NiOx above 150 °C reduces the device performance due to the formation of Ni2O3 species [ 26 ]  A reduction of the device performance was also seen by Hou et al  when heating the NiOx film above 140 °C [ 16 ]  Moreover  it was shown that p-i-n devices with MAPbI3 as absorber layer reveal low to almost negligible hysteresis  especially if NiOx is used as HTL [ 9  27 ]  Recently  a PCE of 184 % for perovskite-based solar cells with a NiOx HTL was reported by Bai et al  who investigated the perovskite crystal growth on NiOx films and the formation of intermediate layers ( MAPbI3-DMSO ) with increasing DMSO concentration [ 25 ]  In this work  we investigate and compare different hole transport layers ( HTLs )  namely solution based NiOx  sputtered NiOx  and PEDOT : PSS  in solar cells using the triple cation lead halide perovskite Cs008 ( MA017FA083 ) 092Pb ( I083Br017 ) 3 as absorber layer in terms of solar cell performance and hysteresis properties of the devices  2 Results and discussion 21 Preparation and characterisation of the hole transport layers The synthesis of the NiOx nanoparticles was adapted from literature [ 9  26  27 ] and is conducted at room temperature with a subsequent drying step at 80 °C and a temperature treatment at 270 °C  which results in non-stoichiometric NiOx [ 26  27 ]  The X-ray diffraction pattern in Fig  1a  shows five distinct reflections at 372°  433°  627°  754° and 794° 2θ which correspond to the lattice planes ( 111 )  ( 200 )  ( 220 )  ( 311 )  and ( 222 ) of NiOx in the cubic crystal structure [ 27 ]  It also indicates that neither Ni ( OH ) 2 nor NaNO3 impurities are present  The primary crystallite size was estimated using the Scherrer equation to be around 8 nm  Fig  1 figure 1 X-ray diffractogram of the NiOx nanocrystals displaying the reflections of cubic NiOx at 372°  433°  627°  754° and 794° 2θ  which match well with the reference PDF 01-078-0429 ( a ) ; X-ray diffractogram of the Cs008 ( MA017FA083 ) 092Pb ( I083Br017 ) 3 perovskite on a glass substrate displaying all characteristic reflections according to Ref  [ 7 ] ( b ) Full size image To prepare NiOx thin films  the nanoparticles were dispersed in deionized water to form a black ink  which was used for spin coating in ambient conditions  After spin casting  the NiOx layers did not undergo further annealing or post-treatment steps  The layer thickness was found to be between 29 and 39 nm  Alternatively  10 nm thick NiOx layers were prepared by sputtering  The NiOx layers were sputtered from an oxide target ( 4-in  in diameter ) using a RF magnetron source at a power of 200 W in an Ar/O2 ( 80/20 ) mixture and a gas pressure of 5 µbar [ 28 ]  PEDOT : PSS layers ( ~ 35 nm ) were prepared by spin coating  In Fig  2a  the transmission spectra of the investigated HTLs are shown  The solution processed NiOx nanoparticle film as well as the PEDOT : PSS film showed high transparency greater than 80 % on indium tin oxide ( ITO ) substrates  Compared to that  the sputtered NiOx film showed less transmission of around 70 %  In sputtering experiments with different Ar/O2 ratios  we found that a higher O2 content ( up to 20 % ) fosters the formation of films with higher transparency  Based on that we assume that the diminished transmission stems most likely from low oxygen content in the sputtered NiOx films  We increased the transmittance of the sputtered NiOx films by an annealing step at 150 °C in ambient conditions  however  in this case problems with the wettability of the perovskite coating solution and consequently with the homogeneity of the perovskite layers occurred  Consequently  non-annealed sputtered NiOx films were used for further experiments  Fig  2 figure 2 a Transmission spectra of glass substrates covered with ITO  ITO/solution processed NiOx  ITO/sputtered NiOx and ITO/PEDOT : PSS ; b Absorption spectrum of the Cs008 ( MA017FA083 ) 092Pb ( I083Br017 ) 3 perovskite on a glass substrate  The precursor solution was 1:4 diluted compared to the precursor used for solar cell fabrication [ solvent : DMF : DMSO ( 1:4 v/v ) ] Full size image 22 Preparation of the triple cation perovskite—Cs008 ( MA017FA083 ) 092Pb ( I083Br017 ) 3 The triple cation perovskite approach incorporating cesium ( Cs )  methylammonium ( MA )  and formamidinium ( FA ) as monovalent cations was adopted from Saliba et al  [ 7 ] and was prepared with a Cs-content of 8 % ( see Sect  4 )  By combining these three different cations ( MA/FA/Cs )  the mixed cation perovskite crystalizes in a cubic crystal structure  which corresponds to a black phase [ 4 ]  In Fig  1b  the X-ray diffractogram of the triple cation perovskite ( prepared on a glass substrate ) shows the typical pattern of the perovskite structure and matches well with literature data [ 7 ]  As can be further seen  no impurities such as lead iodide  methylammonium iodide or FAPbI3 were observed  The addition of Cs fosters the formation of the desired black phase and suppresses the yellow phase of FAPbI3 [ 4 ]  Another important issue is the ratio of the solvent mixture to obtain a uniform film formation  Herein a mixture of DMSO/DMF ( 4/1 v/v ) was used because the strong coordinative solvent DMSO enhances the dissolution of PbI2 [ 29 ]  The perovskite film thicknesses were in the same range ( 280–320 nm ) on all substrates and interfacial layers  The surface morphology of a perovskite film prepared on a glass/ITO/NiOx substrate was investigated by SEM and can be seen in Fig  3a  The top view image indicates homogenous growth on NiOx with complete coverage of the perovskite film without obvious pinholes and grain sizes ranging from ~ 100 to 500 nm  The absorption spectrum ( shown in Fig  2b ) corresponds to the data in the literature [ 4  6 ]  Fig  3 figure 3 Top view SEM image of a perovskite film prepared on a NiOx layer ( a )  a schematic representation of the device structure ( p-i-n type ) used in this study ( b )  and the corresponding energy level diagram : ITO ( − 47 eV )

] Full size image 23 Device preparation Up to now  Cs—containing mixed ion perovskite solar cells were mostly fabricated in n-i-p device structures on mesoporous TiO2 [ 4  6 ]  In our study  this efficient perovskite absorber is investigated in the planar p-i-n structure adopted from organic solar cells  which already gave promising PCE values with MAPbI3 absorber layers ranging from 10 % to above 18 % [ 8  17  19  25  27  30 ]  A scheme of the used solar cell architecture is depicted in Fig  3b  In a first step  the respective HTL is deposited on glass/ITO substrates  Subsequently  the perovskite absorber layer is coated  followed by the deposition of a 50 nm thick PC60BM layer as ETL  The solar cells were completed by the deposition of silver electrodes with a thickness of approximately 120 nm by thermal evaporation  In Fig  3c  an energy level diagram of the used materials in the solar cells is presented  Compared to PEDOT : PSS ( valence band of − 52 eV )  the valence band ( VB ) of NiOx ( − 549 eV ) is well aligned to the VB of the mixed cation perovskite ( − 550 eV )  NiOx exhibits a high conduction band ( CB ) of − 185 eV whereas the CB of the perovskite is only − 388 eV  which makes NiOx a good electron blocking layer [ 6  9  26  31 ]  PC60BM ( CB : − 42 eV ) acts as electron transport layer in this device configuration [ 14  32 ]  In Fig  4 cross sectional SEM images of the prepared solar cells are displayed  In the images of the devices with a solution processed NiOx HTL depicted in Fig  4a  d  the NiOx nanoparticle films can be clearly seen and the distribution appears inhomogeneous  However  this inhomogeneity most likely does not stem from the spin coating process  but from breaking the device for the analysis of the cross-section  For the devices with PEDOT : PSS hole transport layer ( Fig  4b  e ) a homogenous PEDOT : PSS film with a thickness of around 35 nm was observed  Also the sputtered NiOx layer appears very homogenous in the cross sectional SEM images in Fig  4c  f and the thickness is approx  10 nm  In the cross sections of all devices  the perovskite films reveal a thickness between 280 and 320 nm  On top of the perovskite films  the PC60BM layers  which appear slightly darker  can be distinguished and the devices in ( Fig  4d–f ) are prepared with an additional ZnO nanoparticle layer  The ZnO nanoparticle film is homogenous in all samples  covering the PC60BM film with a layer thickness of around 70–100 nm  Fig  4 figure 4 Cross sectional SEM images acquired using an in-lens detector of solar cells

Ag electrode ( d )  a PEDOT : PSS HTL with a ZnO interfacial layer ( e )  and with a sputtered NiOx HTL with a ZnO interfacial layer ( f ) Full size image In a next step  the film thickness of the solution processed NiOx layer was varied and its influence on the solar cell performance was studied  By changing the spin coating parameters  NiOx layers with thicknesses of 29  34 and 39 nm ( ± 1 nm ) were deposited  Figure 5a shows the current density–voltage ( J–V ) curves of typical devices  Table 1 summarizes the characteristic J–V parameters of these cells  Solar cells with NiOx layers of 29 and 34 nm exhibit very similar device parameters  with VOC values about 095 V  JSC values about 22 mA/cm2 and FF values about 60 % yielding overall PCEs of approx  13 %  In contrast to that  for solar cells with NiOx layers of 39 nm  the JSC values are reduced to about 19 mA/cm2 and the FF to values of 53 % yielding to typical PCEs values of 9 %  The doubling of the series resistance indicates that the NiOx-layer is getting too thick  Other important aspects which have to be taken into account are voids or pinholes that increase in number when the layer thickness of NiOx is decreased [ 33 ]  This is consistent with our findings  The shunt resistance is getting higher with increasing layer thickness  In this regard  the solar cells with 34 nm thick NiOx films showing the highest FF and good VOC and JSC values have been chosen for further optimization  Moreover  the devices are showing only a small hysteresis as can be seen exemplarily in Fig  5b  Fig  5 figure 5 a J–V curves of solar cells with different layer thicknesses of the solution processed NiOx HTL ; b typical J–V curves of solar cells prepared with solution processed NiOx  sputtered NiOx  PEDOT : PSS  and without

ZnO interfacial layer between the PC60BM film and the silver electrode measured in forward and backward direction from 0 to 1 V with a scan rate of 150 mV/s  The J–V curves measured in backward direction ( BWD ) are denoted with solid symbols  the curves measured in forward direction ( FWD ) with hollow symbols Full size image Table 1 Characteristic parameters of the solar cells prepared with different thicknesses of the solution processed NiOx HTL Full size table Next  solar cells with sputtered NiOx ( 10 nm ) and PEDOT : PSS as HTL and devices without HTL have been investigated  In Fig  5b  the J–V curves of the best devices are compared with those of solar cells using solution processed NiOx ( 34 nm )  The corresponding device parameters of these solar cells as well as the mean values and the standard deviations are given in Table 2  Compared to the solar cells with the solution processed NiOx HTL  in devices with a sputtered NiOx film  the PCE was reduced from 126 to 83 %  which is mainly due to a significantly lower FF  The reason for the lower FF ( 51 % ) is most likely the low film thickness of the sputtered NiOx film of only 10 nm and thereby insufficient electron blocking properties  With the sputtered NiOx layers  a trade-off needs to be made  On one hand  for thicker NiOx layers  the shunt resistance and electron blocking properties are better  but the series resistance and the absorption losses are high  On the other hand  for thin NiOx layers  the absorption losses are moderate but the shunt resistance and electron blocking properties suffer ( see Table 2 )  The high optical losses are maybe the most critical factor here  which does not come into play for the nanoparticle-based NiOx layer  Table 2 Characteristic parameters of the solar cells with solution processed or sputtered NiOx  PEDOT : PSS  or no HTL Full size table The prepared devices with PEDOT : PSS as HTL show a lower VOC ( 074 V ) compared to NiOx-based devices ( 091–094 V )  As was found by Liu et al  this lower VOC is most likely due to the fact that methylammonium iodide can decrease the intrinsic p-doping in PEDOT : PSS leading to a reduced work function and non-efficient hole collection [ 34 ]  For comparison purposes  we also prepared devices without HTL  Due to the absence of a hole selective contact  the VOC as well as the fill factor in these solar cells are significantly reduced and PCEs of only approx  1 % could be obtained  Regarding the hysteresis behaviour  for solar cells with solution processed or sputtered NiOx HTLs low hysteresis was observed  whereas devices with PEDOT : PSS layers show a more pronounced one  When using no HTL  a strong hysteresis effect could be seen ( Fig  5b )  The J–V curves of solar cells with solution processed and sputtered NiOx as well as PEDOT : PSS HTLs and an additional ZnO nanoparticle interlayer on top of the PC60BM film measured in forward and backward scan direction are depicted in Fig  5c and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 3  Devices using solution processed NiOx as HTL revealed again the highest PCE of 126 % with an average of 125 ± 019 %  In all devices  the FF increased independent of the used HTL  which is attributed to a reduced leakage path and improved hole blocking properties of the ETL  Table 3 Performance of the solar cells with an additional ZnO interfacial layer between the PC60BM layer and the silver electrode Full size table Moreover  by the deposition of the ZnO nanoparticle layer  the hysteresis effect was diminished even further for the solar cells prepared with a solution processed NiOx hole transport layer ( see Fig  5c )  As can be also seen in Fig  5c  the addition of the ZnO interlayer does not have a positive influence on the hysteresis behaviour of the devices with sputtered NiOx or PEDOT : PSS HTLs  3 Conclusion In conclusion  NiOx HTLs led—compared to PEDOT : PSS HTLs—to higher power conversion efficiencies of solar cells with the triple cation lead halide perovskite Cs008 ( MA017FA083 ) 092Pb ( I083Br017 ) 3 as absorber layer  In this study  two types of NiOx HTLs were investigated  whereby solution processed NiOx HTLs  prepared from NiOx nanoparticle inks  performed better than sputtered NiOx films  The lower PCE of the devices with a PEDOT : PSS HTL is mainly due to a decreased VOC and a lower FF  SEM images of the cross sections of the investigated devices revealed similar thicknesses of the perovskite absorber layer ( 280–320 nm ) in all devices and good homogeneity of all layers in the solar cell stack  Furthermore  compared to devices with PEDOT : PSS as HTL  solar cells with a solution processed nanoparticle based NiOx HTL showed very small hysteresis  The incorporation of a ZnO nanoparticle layer as an additional ETL between the PC60BM film and the silver electrode significantly improved the FF of the devices prepared with the different HTLs  4 Experimental details 41

66 ] -Phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester ( PC60BM ) from Solenne  and silver from Kurt J Lesker Company  All the other chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich  42 Preparation of ITO substrates Patterned glass/ITO substrates ( 15 × 15 × 11 mm ) ( 10 Ω/sq ) from Xinyan Technology were pre-cleaned with acetone  put in an isopropyl alcohol bath and placed in an ultrasonic bath at 40 °C for 30 min  The substrates were then dried with N2 and further plasma etched for 3 min  43 NiOx nanoparticle synthesis and film formation The nickel ( II ) oxide nanoparticles were synthesized according to literature with small changes [ 9  26  27 ]  Briefly  nickel ( II ) nitrate hexahydrate ( NiNO3·6H2O ) ( 005 mol ) was dispersed in 10 ml deionized water and stirred for 5 min  Afterwards sodium hydroxide ( NaOH  10 M ) was added dropwise to adjust a pH of 10  which results in a colour change from dark to light green  The colloidal precipitate was then washed with deionized water to remove side products  The light green residue was then dried at 80 °C for 6 h and further calcinated at 270 °C for 2 h  resulting in non-stoichiometric black nickel ( II ) oxide nanoparticles  In a next step  the NiOx NPs ( 2 wt % ) were dispersed in deionized water  placed in an ultrasonic bath at 40 °C for 2 h and filtered through a 045 µm PVDF syringe filter to produce the NiOx ink used for thin film formation  The NiOx nanoparticle ink was spin coated at different speeds ( 2500–4500 rpm ) for 30 s and the NiOx films on the glass/ITO substrates were dried at room temperature for 1 h 44 PEDOT : PSS film formation PEDOT : PSS ( P VP AI 4083 ) ( 05 ml ) was mixed with 1 ml isopropyl alcohol  placed in an ultrasonic bath for 1 h and filtered through a 045 µm PVDF syringe filter  The solution was then spin coated in ambient air at 3000 rpm for 60 s followed by drying at 130 °C for 20 min also in ambient air  Afterwards  to increase the wettability of the perovskite solution  the substrates were treated with isopropyl alcohol by placing the substrate on a spin coater  applying 200 µl of isopropyl alcohol on the PEDOT : PSS film followed by a spin coating step ( 2000 rpm for 2 s  4000 rpm for 10 s ) to dry the substrate and an additional annealing step with the same parameters as used before ( 130 °C for 20 min ) [ 30 ]  45 Sputtered NiOx The 4-in  diameter NiOx target was mounted on a RF magnetron source and sputtered at 200 W in Ar/O2 ( 80/20 ) atmosphere  at a pressure of 5 µbar  without substrate heating  The sputtering tool was a Leybold Univex 450C with a base vacuum of 1 × 10−7 mbar  46 Perovskite precursor and film formation The triple cation perovskite precursor was prepared by introducing slight changes in the procedure used by Saliba et al  [ 7 ]  The precursor consisted of lead iodide ( PbI2  11 M )  lead bromide ( PbBr2  02 M )  formamidinium iodide ( FAI  1M )  and methylammonium bromide ( MABr  02 M ) dissolved in a 1:4 ( v/v ) DMF : DMSO solvent mixture  A second solution of cesium iodide ( CsI  15 M ) in DMSO was prepared and added to the first solution to get the desired Cs content of 8 %  The spin coating was carried out in a two-step process at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 6000 rpm for 20 s The spinning substrate was treated with 50 µl chlorobenzene as an anti-solvent during the last 5 s of the spinning process  which allowed the precipitation of the perovskite  The substrates were then annealed at 100 °C for 1 h All steps were carried out inside a glovebox with nitrogen atmosphere  47 Electron transport layer film formation and top electrode A 20 mg/ml solution of PC60BM in chlorobenzene was prepared and stirred for 2 h at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere [ 27 ]  The solution was spin coated at 2000 rpm for 60 s Afterwards  the top electrode ( 120 nm Ag ) was deposited by thermal evaporation under high vacuum conditions ( 1 × 10−5 mbar ) using a shadow mask ( active area of 009 cm2 )  48 Interfacial layer film formation A zinc oxide nanoparticle ink ( purchased from Sigma Aldrich ) was spin coated on the PC60BM layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s without any further treatment under nitrogen atmosphere before the deposition of the silver electrode  49 Characterization The NiOx nanoparticles as well as the triple cation perovskite were characterized by X-ray diffraction with a PANalytical Empyrean system which uses Cu K alpha radiation  UV–Vis measurements of the HTLs were performed using the UV/VIS Spectrometer—Lambda 35 by Perkin Elmer  The layer thicknesses of all HTLs were determined by ellipsometry using a M-2000 instrument ( JA  Woollam Co  USA ) in reflection at incident angles of 65°  70° and 75°  The optical data were recorded in the wavelength range of 370–1000 nm  The experimental data were modeled with the CompleteEASE® software  using a three-layer system consisting of the silicon substrate  the interfacial oxide layer and a Cauchy function with Urbach tail as top layer  The thicknesses of the absorber material and the ETLs were measured by surface profilometry using a DektakXT device by Bruker as well as by cross sectional SEM images acquired on a Zeiss-Supra 40 scanning

Article 16 February 2024 1 Introduction The investigation of inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite solar cells is of major interest since its massive increase in power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) from 38 % [ 1 ] in 2009 to 221 % in 2016 [ 2 ]  The highest PCEs so far were achieved in n-i-p device architectures  using mesoporous TiO2 as electron transport layer ( ETL ) and spiro-OMeTAD as hole transport layer ( HTL )  respectively [ 3 ]  Recently  Saliba et al  introduced a triple cation perovskite  using a combination of methylammonium  formamidinium and cesium ions ( MA/FA/Cs ) and a mixture of bromide and iodide reaching PCE values of more than 20 % together with enhanced device stability  Maximum PCEs of 211 % and 2096 % were reached with a Csx ( MA017FA083 ) ( 100−x ) Pb ( I083Br017 ) 3 perovskite absorber layer where x = 5 and 10  respectively  This A-site cation combination results in the suppression of the photovoltaic non-active “ yellow phase ” and enhances perovskite crystallinity  However  so far this route is mainly investigated in n-i-p based perovskite solar cells [ 456 ]  In these structures  TiO2 is used as ETL in most cases in combination with HTLs such as spiro-OMeTAD or other organic HTLs [ 7 ]  Despite reaching high efficiencies  commonly high temperature processing is required for the preparation of the compact and mesoporous TiO2 films limiting low cost and energy efficient fabrication  Compared to the n-i-p device structures containing mesoporous TiO2  p-i-n planar devices offer low temperature fabrication  which is favourable for roll-to-roll fabrication [ 8  9 ]  In p-i-n perovskite devices  usually PCBM is used as ETL and poly ( 34-ethylenedioxythiophene ) polystyrene sulfonate ( PEDOT : PSS ) as HTL  However  due to its acidic nature and hygroscopic character  devices with PEDOT : PSS layers might degrade faster than devices with eg  NiOx hole transport layers  which have a similar valence band energy as PEDOT : PSS films [ 1011121314 ]  Some research groups also reported better crystallinity of the perovskite film on a NiOx layer than on PEDOT : PSS [ 15  16 ]  NiOx is an inorganic metal oxide semiconductor  which exhibits high optical transmittance  high stability  easy processability  and a wide band gap that allows high hole mobility and good electron blocking ability [ 17  18 ]  There exist several methods for NiOx deposition  like atomic layer deposition  flame spray synthesis  pulsed laser deposition  sputtering and electrodeposition [ 16  19202122 ]  However  for fast and large scale roll-to-roll fabrication  coating or printing processes for the application of the NiOx films are of interest  In this regard  several methods using spin coating followed by an additional annealing step are reported [ 232425 ]  Interestingly  higher temperature treatment of the NiOx films significantly affects the device performance  Jiang et al  reported that annealing NiOx above 150 °C reduces the device performance due to the formation of Ni2O3 species [ 26 ]  A reduction of the device performance was also seen by Hou et al  when heating the NiOx film above 140 °C [ 16 ]  Moreover  it was shown that p-i-n devices with MAPbI3 as absorber layer reveal low to almost negligible hysteresis  especially if NiOx is used as HTL [ 9  27 ]  Recently  a PCE of 184 % for perovskite-based solar cells with a NiOx HTL was reported by Bai et al  who investigated the perovskite crystal growth on NiOx films and the formation of intermediate layers ( MAPbI3-DMSO ) with increasing DMSO concentration [ 25 ]  In this work  we investigate and compare different hole transport layers ( HTLs )  namely solution based NiOx  sputtered NiOx  and PEDOT : PSS  in solar cells using the triple cation lead halide perovskite Cs008 ( MA017FA083 ) 092Pb ( I083Br017 ) 3 as absorber layer in terms of solar cell performance and hysteresis properties of the devices  2 Results and discussion 21 Preparation and characterisation of the hole transport layers The synthesis of the NiOx nanoparticles was adapted from literature [ 9  26  27 ] and is conducted at room temperature with a subsequent drying step at 80 °C and a temperature treatment at 270 °C  which results in non-stoichiometric NiOx [ 26  27 ]  The X-ray diffraction pattern in Fig  1a  shows five distinct reflections at 372°  433°  627°  754° and 794° 2θ which correspond to the lattice planes ( 111 )  ( 200 )  ( 220 )  ( 311 )  and ( 222 ) of NiOx in the cubic crystal structure [ 27 ]  It also indicates that neither Ni ( OH ) 2 nor NaNO3 impurities are present  The primary crystallite size was estimated using the Scherrer equation to be around 8 nm  Fig  1 figure 1 X-ray diffractogram of the NiOx nanocrystals displaying the reflections of cubic NiOx at 372°  433°  627°  754° and 794° 2θ  which match well with the reference PDF 01-078-0429 ( a ) ; X-ray diffractogram of the Cs008 ( MA017FA083 ) 092Pb ( I083Br017 ) 3 perovskite on a glass substrate displaying all characteristic reflections according to Ref  [ 7 ] ( b ) Full size image To prepare NiOx thin films  the nanoparticles were dispersed in deionized water to form a black ink  which was used for spin coating in ambient conditions  After spin casting  the NiOx layers did not undergo further annealing or post-treatment steps  The layer thickness was found to be between 29 and 39 nm  Alternatively  10 nm thick NiOx layers were prepared by sputtering  The NiOx layers were sputtered from an oxide target ( 4-in  in diameter ) using a RF magnetron source at a power of 200 W in an Ar/O2 ( 80/20 ) mixture and a gas pressure of 5 µbar [ 28 ]  PEDOT : PSS layers ( ~ 35 nm ) were prepared by spin coating  In Fig  2a  the transmission spectra of the investigated HTLs are shown  The solution processed NiOx nanoparticle film as well as the PEDOT : PSS film showed high transparency greater than 80 % on indium tin oxide ( ITO ) substrates  Compared to that  the sputtered NiOx film showed less transmission of around 70 %  In sputtering experiments with different Ar/O2 ratios  we found that a higher O2 content ( up to 20 % ) fosters the formation of films with higher transparency  Based on that we assume that the diminished transmission stems most likely from low oxygen content in the sputtered NiOx films  We increased the transmittance of the sputtered NiOx films by an annealing step at 150 °C in ambient conditions  however  in this case problems with the wettability of the perovskite coating solution and consequently with the homogeneity of the perovskite layers occurred  Consequently  non-annealed sputtered NiOx films were used for further experiments  Fig  2 figure 2 a Transmission spectra of glass substrates covered with ITO

( I083Br017 ) 3 The triple cation perovskite approach incorporating cesium ( Cs )  methylammonium ( MA )  and formamidinium ( FA ) as monovalent cations was adopted from Saliba et al  [ 7 ] and was prepared with a Cs-content of 8 % ( see Sect  4 )  By combining these three different cations ( MA/FA/Cs )  the mixed cation perovskite crystalizes in a cubic crystal structure  which corresponds to a black phase [ 4 ]  In Fig  1b  the X-ray diffractogram of the triple cation perovskite ( prepared on a glass substrate ) shows the typical pattern of the perovskite structure and matches well with literature data [ 7 ]  As can be further seen  no impurities such as lead iodide  methylammonium iodide or FAPbI3 were observed  The addition of Cs fosters the formation of the desired black phase and suppresses the yellow phase of FAPbI3 [ 4 ]  Another important issue is the ratio of the solvent mixture to obtain a uniform film formation  Herein a mixture of DMSO/DMF ( 4/1 v/v ) was used because the strong coordinative solvent DMSO enhances the dissolution of PbI2 [ 29 ]  The perovskite film thicknesses were in the same range ( 280–320 nm ) on all substrates and interfacial layers  The surface morphology of a perovskite film prepared on a glass/ITO/NiOx substrate was investigated by SEM and can be seen in Fig  3a  The top view image indicates homogenous growth on NiOx with complete coverage of the perovskite film without obvious pinholes and grain sizes ranging from ~ 100 to 500 nm  The absorption spectrum ( shown in Fig  2b ) corresponds to the data in the literature [ 4  6 ]

42 eV ) [ 14  32 ] and silver ( Ag ) ( − 44 eV ) [ 22 ] Full size image 23 Device preparation Up to now  Cs—containing mixed ion perovskite solar cells were mostly fabricated in n-i-p device structures on mesoporous TiO2 [ 4  6 ]  In our study  this efficient perovskite absorber is investigated in the planar p-i-n structure adopted from organic solar cells  which already gave promising PCE values with MAPbI3 absorber layers ranging from 10 % to above 18 % [ 8  17  19  25  27  30 ]  A scheme of the used solar cell architecture is depicted in Fig  3b  In a first step  the respective HTL is deposited on glass/ITO substrates  Subsequently  the perovskite absorber layer is coated  followed by the deposition of a 50 nm thick PC60BM layer as ETL  The solar cells were completed by the deposition of silver electrodes with a thickness of approximately 120 nm by thermal evaporation  In Fig  3c  an energy level diagram of the used materials in the solar cells is presented  Compared to PEDOT : PSS ( valence band of − 52 eV )  the valence band ( VB ) of NiOx ( − 549 eV ) is well aligned to the VB of the mixed cation perovskite ( − 550 eV )  NiOx exhibits a high conduction band ( CB ) of − 185 eV whereas the CB of the perovskite is only − 388 eV  which makes NiOx a good electron blocking layer [ 6  9  26  31 ]  PC60BM ( CB : − 42 eV ) acts as electron transport layer in this device configuration [ 14  32 ]  In Fig  4 cross sectional SEM images of the prepared solar cells are displayed  In the images of the devices with a solution processed NiOx HTL depicted in Fig  4a  d  the NiOx nanoparticle films can be clearly seen and the distribution appears inhomogeneous  However  this inhomogeneity most likely does not stem from the spin coating process  but from breaking the device for the analysis of the cross-section  For the devices with PEDOT : PSS hole transport layer ( Fig  4b  e ) a homogenous PEDOT : PSS film with a thickness of around 35 nm was observed  Also the sputtered NiOx layer appears very homogenous in the cross sectional SEM images in Fig  4c  f and the thickness is approx  10 nm  In the cross sections of all devices  the perovskite films reveal a thickness between 280 and 320 nm  On top of the perovskite films  the PC60BM layers  which appear slightly darker  can be distinguished and the devices in ( Fig  4d–f ) are prepared with an additional ZnO nanoparticle layer  The ZnO nanoparticle film is homogenous in all samples  covering the PC60BM film with a layer thickness of around 70–100 nm  Fig  4 figure 4 Cross sectional SEM images acquired

next step  the film thickness of the solution processed NiOx layer was varied and its influence on the solar cell performance was studied  By changing the spin coating parameters  NiOx layers with thicknesses of 29  34 and 39 nm ( ± 1 nm ) were deposited  Figure 5a shows the current density–voltage ( J–V ) curves of typical devices  Table 1 summarizes the characteristic J–V parameters of these cells  Solar cells with NiOx layers of 29 and 34 nm exhibit very similar device parameters  with VOC values about 095 V  JSC values about 22 mA/cm2 and FF values about 60 % yielding overall PCEs of approx  13 %  In contrast to that  for solar cells with NiOx layers of 39 nm  the JSC values are reduced to about 19 mA/cm2 and the FF to values of 53 % yielding to typical PCEs values of 9 %  The doubling of the series resistance indicates that the NiOx-layer is getting too thick  Other important aspects which have to be taken into account are voids or pinholes that increase in number when the layer thickness of NiOx is decreased [ 33 ]  This is consistent with our findings  The shunt resistance is getting higher with increasing layer thickness  In this regard  the solar cells with 34 nm thick NiOx films showing the highest FF and good VOC and JSC values have been chosen for further optimization  Moreover  the devices are showing only a small hysteresis as can be seen exemplarily in Fig  5b  Fig  5 figure 5 a J–V curves of solar cells with different layer thicknesses of the solution processed NiOx HTL ; b typical J–V curves of solar cells prepared with solution processed NiOx

mV/s  The J–V curves measured in backward direction ( BWD ) are denoted with solid symbols  the curves measured in forward direction ( FWD ) with hollow symbols Full size image Table 1 Characteristic parameters of the solar cells prepared with different thicknesses of the solution processed NiOx HTL Full size table Next  solar cells with sputtered NiOx ( 10 nm ) and PEDOT : PSS as HTL and devices without HTL have been investigated  In Fig  5b  the J–V curves of the best devices are compared with those of solar cells using solution processed NiOx ( 34 nm )  The corresponding device parameters of these solar cells as well as the mean values and the standard deviations are given in Table 2  Compared to the solar cells with the solution processed NiOx HTL  in devices with a sputtered NiOx film  the PCE was reduced from 126 to 83 %  which is mainly due to a significantly lower FF  The reason for the lower FF ( 51 % ) is most likely the low film thickness of the sputtered NiOx film of only 10 nm and thereby insufficient electron blocking properties  With the sputtered NiOx layers  a trade-off needs to be made  On one hand  for thicker NiOx layers  the shunt resistance and electron blocking properties are better  but the series resistance and the absorption losses are high  On the other hand  for thin NiOx layers  the absorption losses are moderate but the shunt resistance and electron blocking properties suffer ( see Table 2 )  The high optical losses are maybe the most critical factor here  which does not come into play for the nanoparticle-based NiOx layer  Table 2 Characteristic parameters of the solar cells with solution processed or sputtered NiOx  PEDOT : PSS  or no HTL Full size table The prepared devices with PEDOT : PSS as HTL show a lower VOC ( 074 V ) compared to NiOx-based devices ( 091–094 V )  As was found by Liu et al  this lower VOC is most likely due to the fact that methylammonium iodide can decrease the intrinsic p-doping in PEDOT : PSS leading to a reduced work function and non-efficient hole collection [ 34 ]  For comparison purposes  we also prepared devices without HTL  Due to the absence of a hole selective contact  the VOC as well as the fill factor in these solar cells are significantly reduced and PCEs of only approx  1 % could be obtained  Regarding the hysteresis behaviour  for solar cells with solution processed or sputtered NiOx HTLs low hysteresis was observed  whereas devices with PEDOT : PSS layers show a more pronounced one  When using no HTL  a strong hysteresis effect could be seen ( Fig  5b )  The J–V curves of solar cells with solution processed and sputtered NiOx as well as PEDOT : PSS HTLs and an additional ZnO nanoparticle interlayer on top of the PC60BM film measured in forward and backward scan direction are depicted in Fig  5c and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 3  Devices using solution processed NiOx as HTL revealed again the highest PCE of 126 % with an average of 125 ± 019 %  In all devices  the FF increased independent of the used HTL  which is attributed to a reduced leakage path and improved hole blocking properties of the ETL  Table 3 Performance of the solar cells with an additional ZnO interfacial layer between the PC60BM layer and the silver electrode Full size table Moreover  by the deposition of the ZnO nanoparticle layer  the hysteresis effect was diminished even further for the solar cells prepared with a solution processed NiOx hole transport layer ( see Fig  5c )  As can be also seen in Fig  5c  the addition of the ZnO interlayer does not have a positive influence on the hysteresis behaviour of the devices with sputtered NiOx or PEDOT : PSS HTLs  3 Conclusion In conclusion  NiOx HTLs led—compared to PEDOT : PSS HTLs—to higher power conversion efficiencies of solar cells with the triple cation lead halide perovskite Cs008 ( MA017FA083 ) 092Pb ( I083Br017 ) 3 as absorber layer  In this study  two types of NiOx HTLs were investigated  whereby solution processed NiOx HTLs  prepared from NiOx nanoparticle inks  performed better than sputtered NiOx films  The lower PCE of the devices with a PEDOT : PSS HTL is mainly due to a decreased VOC and a lower FF  SEM images of the cross sections of the investigated devices revealed similar thicknesses of the perovskite absorber layer ( 280–320 nm ) in all devices and good homogeneity of all layers in the solar cell stack  Furthermore  compared to devices with PEDOT : PSS as HTL  solar cells with a solution processed nanoparticle based NiOx HTL showed very small hysteresis  The incorporation of a ZnO nanoparticle layer as an additional ETL between the PC60BM film and the silver electrode significantly improved the FF of the devices prepared with the different HTLs  4 Experimental details 41 Materials All chemicals and solvents were used as purchased without any further purification  Nickel ( II ) nitrate hexahydrate was purchased from Fluka

Sigma Aldrich  42 Preparation of ITO substrates Patterned glass/ITO substrates ( 15 × 15 × 11 mm ) ( 10 Ω/sq ) from Xinyan Technology were pre-cleaned with acetone  put in an isopropyl alcohol bath and placed in an ultrasonic bath at 40 °C for 30 min  The substrates were then dried with N2 and further plasma etched for 3 min  43 NiOx nanoparticle synthesis and film formation The nickel ( II ) oxide nanoparticles were synthesized according to literature with small changes [ 9  26  27 ]  Briefly  nickel ( II ) nitrate hexahydrate ( NiNO3·6H2O ) ( 005 mol ) was dispersed in 10 ml deionized water and stirred for 5 min  Afterwards sodium hydroxide ( NaOH  10 M ) was added dropwise to adjust a pH of 10  which results in a colour change from dark to light green  The colloidal precipitate was then washed with deionized water to remove side products  The light green residue was then dried at 80 °C for 6 h and further calcinated at 270 °C for 2 h  resulting in non-stoichiometric black nickel ( II ) oxide nanoparticles  In a next step  the NiOx NPs ( 2 wt % ) were dispersed in deionized water  placed in an ultrasonic bath at 40 °C for 2 h and filtered through a 045 µm PVDF syringe filter to produce the NiOx ink used for thin film formation  The NiOx nanoparticle ink was spin coated at different speeds ( 2500–4500 rpm ) for 30 s and the NiOx films on the glass/ITO substrates were dried at room temperature for 1 h 44 PEDOT : PSS film formation PEDOT : PSS ( P VP AI 4083 ) ( 05 ml ) was mixed with 1 ml isopropyl alcohol  placed in an ultrasonic bath for 1 h and filtered through a 045 µm PVDF syringe filter  The solution was then spin coated in ambient air at 3000 rpm for 60 s followed by drying at 130 °C for 20 min also in ambient air  Afterwards  to increase the wettability of the perovskite solution  the substrates were treated with isopropyl alcohol by placing the substrate on a spin coater  applying 200 µl of isopropyl alcohol on the PEDOT : PSS film followed by a spin coating step ( 2000 rpm for 2 s  4000 rpm for 10 s ) to dry the substrate and an additional annealing step with the same parameters as used before ( 130 °C for 20 min ) [ 30 ]  45 Sputtered NiOx The 4-in  diameter NiOx target was mounted on a RF magnetron source and sputtered at 200 W in Ar/O2 ( 80/20 ) atmosphere  at a pressure of 5 µbar  without substrate heating  The sputtering tool was a Leybold Univex 450C with a base vacuum of 1 × 10−7 mbar  46 Perovskite precursor and film formation The triple cation perovskite precursor was prepared by introducing slight changes in the procedure used by Saliba et al  [ 7 ]  The precursor consisted of lead iodide ( PbI2  11 M )  lead bromide ( PbBr2  02 M )  formamidinium iodide ( FAI  1M )  and methylammonium bromide ( MABr  02 M ) dissolved in a 1:4 ( v/v ) DMF : DMSO solvent mixture  A second solution of cesium iodide ( CsI  15 M ) in DMSO was prepared and added to the first solution to get the desired Cs content of 8 %  The spin coating was carried out in a two-step process at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 6000 rpm for 20 s The spinning substrate was treated with 50 µl chlorobenzene as an anti-solvent during the last 5 s of the spinning process  which allowed the precipitation of the perovskite  The substrates were then annealed at 100 °C for 1 h All steps were carried out inside a glovebox with nitrogen atmosphere  47 Electron transport layer film formation and top electrode A 20 mg/ml solution of PC60BM in chlorobenzene was prepared and stirred for 2 h at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere [ 27 ]  The solution was spin coated at 2000 rpm for 60 s Afterwards  the top electrode ( 120 nm Ag ) was deposited by thermal evaporation under high vacuum conditions ( 1 × 10−5 mbar ) using a shadow mask ( active area of 009 cm2 )  48 Interfacial layer film formation A zinc oxide nanoparticle ink ( purchased from Sigma Aldrich ) was spin coated on the PC60BM layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s without any further treatment under nitrogen atmosphere before the deposition of the silver electrode  49 Characterization The NiOx nanoparticles as well as the triple cation perovskite were characterized by X-ray diffraction with a PANalytical Empyrean system which uses Cu K alpha radiation  UV–Vis measurements of the HTLs were performed using the UV/VIS Spectrometer—Lambda 35 by Perkin Elmer  The layer thicknesses of all HTLs were determined by ellipsometry using a M-2000 instrument ( JA  Woollam Co  USA ) in reflection at incident angles of 65°  70° and 75°  The optical data were recorded in the wavelength range of 370–1000 nm  The experimental data were modeled with the CompleteEASE® software  using a three-layer system consisting of the silicon substrate  the interfacial oxide layer and a Cauchy function with Urbach tail as top layer  The thicknesses of the absorber material and the ETLs were measured by surface profilometry using a DektakXT device by Bruker as well as by cross

material is a great visible light absorber in perovskite solar cells ( PSCs )  PSC has reported power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 221 %  However  performance instability of the solar device base on this material hampers its commercialization  One of the factors responsible for performance instability in the cell is temperature  In this work  we carried out stability study of perovskite film treated with tertiary butylpyridine ( tBP ) as a surface modifier  Concentrations of tBP added in perovskite material film were varied and the samples were subjected to temperature degradation test in a temperature-controlled chamber for 120 h Ultraviolet–visible ( UV–Vis ) spectrophotometers  Fourier-transform infrared ( FT-IR ) spectrometers and X-ray diffractometers ( XRD ) were used to characterize the properties of the temperature-stability-tested samples  The results show that the sample treated with 100 μ l of tBP has the best resistance to temperature degradation after the duration of the test  The surface-modified perovskite films  with 100 μ l of tBP  may reduce the degradation of PSCs  Similar content being viewed by others Terephthalic acid-driven organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells with enhanced humidity stability Article 03 July 2023 Review on Chemical Stability of Lead Halide Perovskite Solar Cells Article Open access 31 March 2023 Long-term Stability of Mixed Perovskites Article 01 December 2015 1 Introduction The chemical formula describes the perovskite material where the A  B and X sites are occupied by an organic cation ( )  metal cation ( ) and halide anion ( )  respectively [ 123 ]  Perovskite is an active layer in perovskite solar cells ( PSCs )  PSC is one of the third-generation solar cells  The third generation of solar cells reduces the cost of the solar cells using Earth-abundant elements  inexpensive fabrication ( low temperature  solution processing and a roll-to-roll manufacturing ) and easy installation ( lightweight and flexibility ) [ 4 ]  Among the third-generation solar cells  PSC has the highest power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 221 % [ 5 ]  One of the striking challenges in PSC is the performance instability of the cells due to degradation of the component ( s ) in the device  Salado et al [ 6 ] reported that perovskite layer causes degradation in the PSCs  Despite high quantum efficiency in hybrid PSCs  the performance instability of the device due to temperature and ambient moisture limits the actual application of PSCs [ 7 ]  One of the external factors responsible for the degradation of PSCs is temperature  Most semiconducting materials exhibit photo-oxidation in the presence of light [ 8 ] as solar panels are placed directly in the sun  In most cases  perovskite films processed in an inert atmosphere degrade  hampering the mass production and real applications of the PSCs [ 9 ]  Several techniques have been deployed in tackling the performance instability of hybrid PSCs  Han ’ s group used the lead ( II ) dioxide–dimethyl sulphoxide ( ) complex to increase the transformation process  leading to high-performance solar cells [ 10 ]  Liu et al [ 11 ] reported efficient and stable PSCs prepared in ambient air based on surface-modified perovskite layer  They added 4-tertiary-butylpyridine ( tBP ) into to form a mixed solution before introducing methylammonium iodide for perovskite film formation  The tBP changed the surface of and enhanced the performance and stability of the hybrid PSCs fabricated in ambient air  However  optimization of the concentrations of tBP was not reported in the research  Li et al [ 12 ] used anti-solvent materials to modify the surface of layer to create voids before dropping methylammonium iodide to form the perovskite layer  They discovered that the anti-solvent extracted dimethylformamide ( DMF ) used as a solvent in the film before annealing  leading to crystallization and film-volume reduction  The reduction of film volume helps in the proper formation of perovskite on the addition of methylammonium iodide and the reduction of unreacted  which is unwanted during film formation  In this work  we report the optimization of concentration of tBP as a surface modifier towards the stability of perovskite layer  Before addition of methylammonium iodide  tBP of different concentrations ( 0–250 μ l ) was added to the surface of and the samples were subjected to temperature stability test in a temperature-controlled chamber for 120 h The characterized samples of as-prepared and aged films revealed the volume of tBP required for temperature-stable films for real application in photovoltaic technology  2 Materials and methods 21 Perovskite thin films deposition Glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with detergent  distilled water  acetone  ethanol and isopropyl alcohol ( IPA )  for 15 min at 27 C and blow-dried with nitrogen gas  A two-step method of deposition of perovskite films was used  ( Aldrich  999985 % ; 460 mg ) was dissolved in 1 ml DMF and then different volumes ( 0–250 μ l in a step size of 50 μ l ) of tBP were added in the solutions and warmed at 70 C for 20 min with magnetic stirring  The mixture was then spin-coated on the substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s We dropped a solution of methylammonium iodide in 2-propanol ( 30 mg on the films and spin-coated at 2500 rpm for 30 s in ambient condition  Afterwards  the as-prepared films were annealed at 100 C for 30 min and the colour changed to dark brown  22 Films degradation measurement Stability test of the perovskite samples against temperature was carried out in a fabricated temperature-controlled chamber  Treated and untreated samples were inserted in the temperature-controlled chamber as reported elsewhere [ 13 ] and left for 24–120 h at intervals of 24 h Then  the temperature-conditioned samples were characterized  23 Characterization of perovskite films The as-prepared and aged samples were characterized using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer ( Lambda 35 Perkin-Elmer )  X-ray diffractometer ( PANalytical Empyrean ) and Fourier-transform infrared ( FT-IR ) spectrometer ( Thermo Scientific  iS5 Nicolet )  The FT-IR measurement was carried out using KBr pellets as substrate  We performed the X-ray diffraction using fixed CuK α radiation  in ambient condition  3 Results 31 Optical properties of as-prepared and aged perovskite films The stability test of as-prepared perovskite films prepared in ambient condition was carried out in the temperature-controlled environment  The absorption of the films kept at a temperature of 55 and 85 C and an average relative humidity of was measured  The perovskite films were exposed to light of and monitored for 5 days at two different temperatures of 55 and 85 C Figure 1 shows tBP-untreated films ; room temperature was between 27 and 29 C The samples were aged for 0  24  48  72  96 and 120 h at 55 and 85 C The samples were aged under continuous illumination of light at the temperature of 55 C for 120 h A small effect of temperature was noticed on the samples treated at the temperature of 55 C for 24 h Fig  1 figure 1 Absorbance spectra of perovskite films at 55 C aged without tBP  Full size image The samples at the temperature of 55 C aged for 120 h were visibly degraded  The peaks of absorption occurred at 491 and 74875 nm corresponding to the absorption values of 24085 and 07561  respectively  There was visible degradation of the samples after 24 h This shows that the samples degrade after 24 h to form and the degradation is proportional to the duration and amount of light illumination on the samples  Also  the offset absorption of the samples occurs at 780 nm and it is in agreement with the report of Abdelmageed et al [ 14 ]  In 120 h  9509 % of the sample was degraded  This shows that using such films in fabrication of PSCs involves degradation risk  which can affect the efficiency of the cell  Also  perovskite films without tBP treatment were aged under illumination of light at 85 C ( figure 2 )  The absorption spectra of samples tested at temperature of 85 C show exponential decay with time  The perovskite film stored at 85 C decayed faster than the film stored at 55 C as shown in figures 1 and 2  The films at temperatures of 55 and 85 C show different absorption features upon aging  The film stored at 85 C shows very low absorption across the visible spectrum upon degradation and a weak absorption peak at 500 nm  Fig  2 figure 2 Absorbance spectra of perovskite films at 85 C aged without tBP  Full size image The absorption of the films at the two temperatures closely matches the absorbance of with a strong absorption peak at 500 nm  which is similar to the report of Christians et al [ 15 ]  Crystallographic data  reported earlier from methylammonium lead iodide films degraded in light  confirmed that the perovskite films stored in light do degrade to form [ 16 ]  The as-prepared film was compared to the aged films  and they showed adverse visible degradation  About fifty percent ( 50 % ) of the pristine sample degraded within 24 h The rate of degradation of the sample was higher when subjected to light illumination at temperature of 85 C  than at 55 C After five hours ( 5 h )  about 23 % of the pristine sample remained  There is blue-shift in absorption by the samples as they degrade as shown in figure 2  In addition  at different temperatures  blue-shift in absorption offset of the samples was observed  The perovskite films could have been transformed to another material as they reacted at these temperatures  Results of samples degraded at both temperatures for 120 h ( figure 3 ) show the extent of samples ’ degradation with respect to the temperature  The sample subjected to temperature of 85 C at 120 h degraded more than the sample tested at 55 C for the same duration  Fig  3 figure 3 Comparison of absorbance spectra of perovskite films at 55 and 85 C aged for 120 h without tBP  Full size image The result clearly demonstrates that subjecting perovskite film to temperature of 85 C adversely degrades the sample  After 24 h  it was seen vividly that the perovskite was very slightly degraded at 55 C  and showed more degradation at 85 C This result is in agreement with previous report made by Juarez-Perez et al [ 17 ] and Conings et al [ 18 ]  Figure 4 shows the effect of tBP treatment on the ultraviolet–visible ( UV–Vis ) absorption spectra  The perovskite thin films were synthesized in ambient condition  Various concentrations of tBP on perovskite film and their respective samples absorption behaviours are shown in figure 4  All the samples were freshly prepared with various concentrations of surface modifier ( tBP )  The samples were treated with 0  50  100  150  200 and 250 μ l of tBP  The sample treated with 100 μ l tBP has the highest absorbance among the samples treated with tBP  The offset absorption of the sample treated with 50 μ l tBP occurred at 780 nm  which is in agreement with reported value [ 19 ]  Figure 4 shows that tBP treatment causes a slight red-shift in the offset absorption  which could be attributed to tuning behaviour of the film due to incorporation of tBP in lattices of perovskite  Significant difference in absorption intensities of the treated films was observed between the as-prepared film and the tBP-treated films  Fig  4 figure 4 Absorption spectra of treated films with concentration variation of tBP  Full size image The results of as-prepared methylammonium lead iodide films treated with tBP of various concentrations and various concentrations of tBP used are presented in table 1  Table 1 Concentration of tBP in films and their respective absorbance  Full size table Supplementary figure 1 ( S1 ) shows the absorption spectra of aged methylammonium lead iodide films treated with 50 μ l of tBP  The spectra show that absorption of the films is inversely proportional to duration of aging  The samples maintained absorption peaks at 491 and 748 nm for 96 h  which agrees with earlier report of Liu et al [ 11 ]  The peaks at 748 nm disappeared as the sample aged for 120 h in sample treated with 50 μ l tBP for 120 h Figure 5 compares the absorption spectrum of lead iodide and sample treated with 50 μ l tBP for 120 h Both samples have peaks at 504 nm  This further shows that the sample aged for 120 h at 55 C degraded to lead iodide material  This indicates that the perovskite materials degraded and transformed to  The reaction that could lead to degradation of perovskite film to is stated in equation ( 1 ) : ( 1 ) Fig  5 figure 5 Comparison of absorption spectra of aged and lead iodide films  Full size image The volatile vaporized and as left out [ 20 ]  The average absorbance

spectra of PA1 and  which showed close match between the samples  Figure 6 shows the spectra of the aged  Negligible degradation of the perovskite sample was recorded for 5 days at 55 C Comparing figure 7a and b with Supplementary figure 1  the sample treated with 100 μ l of tBP resists degradation more than the sample treated with 50 μ l This shows that surface modification of perovskite film with 100 μ l stabilizes the film better  This could be attributed to modification of and or defects on the perovskite surface with the tertiary butyl group of the tBP  Supplementary figure 2 shows the absorption spectra of films modified with 50 μ l of tBP and aged for 120 h at 85 C All the films have high onset absorption at 748 nm  The optical bandgap of the perovskite film was calculated from the onset wavelength using equation ( 2 ) : Fig  6 figure 6 Absorption spectra of films modified with 100 μ l of tBP and aged for 5 days at 55 C Full size image Fig  7 figure 7 Absorption spectra of films modified with 50  100 and 150 μ l of tBP and aged for 5 days at ( a ) 55 C and ( b ) 85 C Full size image ( 2 ) where is optical bandgap energy  h is Planck ’ s constant  is wavelength and c is speed of light  The optical bandgap energy is 159 eV  which corresponds to the value reported by Burschka et al [ 21 ]  There is noticeable decrease in sample absorption of light as the duration of sample aging increases  The adverse effect of photo-induced degradation on the sample shows that after 24 h  the sample subjected to the temperature of 85 C reduces its average absorption by 39 % ; 45 % of the film is retained on the substrate at 120 h of the photo-illumination test  This showed that the 50 μ l of tBP added to the film could not inhibit degradation of the film  Supplementary figure 3 shows the perovskite film treated with 100 μ l of tBP  The average absorption value of the sample after 24 h was  The percentage of the absorbance of the film that did not degrade was about 94 % after 24 h After 120 h  the sample ’ s absorbance value retained was ( 63 % )  This shows that addition of 100 μ l of tBP in the film reduced degradation of the perovskite film  Also  Supplementary figure 4a and b shows samples treated with 150 μ l of tBP and subjected to photo-illumination for 5 days at 55 and 85 C  respectively  The absorbance of the sample at 85 C reduced from to after 24 h This implies that 63 % of the absorption value of the sample is retained on the substrate  Further  exposing the sample at 85 C for 120 h showed that the sample ’ s absorbance value reduced to ( 2609 % )  Here  the amount of tBP in the perovskite film could not inhibit degradation in the sample  It shows that 100 μ l of tBP is preferred for inhibiting degradation of the sample  The extents of stabilization of 50  100 and 150 μ l of tBP aged for 5 days at 55 and 85 C are shown in figure 7a and b  The sample treated with 100 μ l of tBP inhibited degradation at both temperatures for 120 h 32 Structural properties of as-prepared and aged perovskite films Figure 8a shows the features of film subjected to 55 C for 120 h in the temperature-controlled chamber  The freshly prepared perovskite film has perovskite signatures crystallized at and 37  which correspond to perovskite signatures reported by Abdelmageed et al [ 14 ] ; the corresponds to reflection from ( 110 )  ( 202 )  ( 220 )  ( 310 ) and ( 240 )  respectively  This confirmed tetragonal phase of methylammonium lead iodide [ 22 ]  The sample subjected to temperature of 55 C for 120 h has perovskite signatures with and 37  Both fresh and 55 C-treated samples showed the phase of metallic Pb ( [ 23 ]  Also  a new peak at is present  which corresponds to the peak assigned to lead ( II ) iodide film signature with and 53 corresponding to ( 001 )  ( 011 )  ( 110 ) and ( 202 )  respectively [ 24 ]  The intensity of the peaks subjected to 55 C reduced to nearly one-third of the freshly prepared sample value  This could be due to degradation of the material  which was revealed by the peak ( ) present in XRD peaks of the degraded sample  The sample subjected to 55 C degraded but retained the peaks of perovskite material  The sample subjected to temperature of 85 C for 120 h  as shown in figure 8b  has visible degradation of the perovskite material  Nearly all the peaks assigned to perovskite in freshly prepared sample vanished in the sample subjected to temperature of 85 C The perovskite signatures existing in the film occurred at and with diminished intensities  peaks occur at and 53  The effect of 85 C test on the sample is more adverse than that of 55 C test  The intensities of the perovskite peaks in the film reduced to about one-fifth of the freshly prepared sample value  The intensity of peaks in the sample ( 85 C ) dominates that of perovskite peaks  Figure 9 compares the films subjected to temperatures of 55 and 85 C for 120 h Fig  8 figure 8 Comparison of perovskite film degraded at temperature of ( a ) 55 C and ( b ) 85 C with freshly prepared perovskite film for 120 h without tBP treatment  Full size image Fig  9 figure 9 Comparison of perovskite film degraded at 85 C with perovskite degraded at 55 C for 120 h without tBP treatment  Full size image Fig  10 figure 10 Freshly prepared perovskite films with surfaces modified by tBP of varying concentrations with step size of 50 μ l Full size image It is clear from figure 9 that perovskite peaks that exist in the sample subjected to 55 C are more intense than the perovskite peaks in the sample subjected to 85 C However  the peaks in the sample subjected to temperature of 85 C are more intense than that of the sample subjected to 55 C This shows that perovskite film subjected to 85 C degrades more than the sample subjected to 55 C Figure 10 shows freshly prepared perovskite films with their surfaces modified by varying tBP concentrations ( in μ l )  Concentrations of 0–250 μ l of tBP with step size of 50 μ l of tBP were used  Six samples were prepared with various concentrations  The sample without tBP additive has the highest intensity of peaks  All the samples crystallize in perovskite phase  with some having non-perovskite peaks  Among all the samples treated with tBP  the sample with 100 μ l of tBP has the highest intensity of peaks with perovskite signatures and preferred orientation of ( 110 )  There were no non-perovskite peaks in the sample treated with 100 μ l of tBP  Samples treated with 150–250 μ l have non-perovskite peaks at  which is assigned to phase  Also  sample PA5 has peak at  This shows that the optimized concentration for surface modification of perovskite film is 100 μ l This agrees with the result obtained in optical property  Figure 11 shows increase in intensity as the sample exposure temperature value decreases  Stronger intensity of peaks was observed for the sample at 55 C exposed for 120 h Figure 12 shows the sample film treated with 100 μ l tBP exposed at 55 and 85 C for 120 h The intensity of peaks of the sample exposed at 85 C is compared with intensity of peaks of the sample exposed at 55 C It is evident that the sample peaks are reduced slightly  It shows that the surface of the films  modified with 100 μ l tBP  is stable when exposed to the conditions  Fig  11 figure 11 Perovskite films degraded for 120 h with 50 μ concentration tBP additive

and after degradation at 85 C for 120 h Full size image 33 FT-IR properties of as-prepared and aged perovskite films FT-IR spectroscopy was conducted for fresh and degraded samples treated with 100 μ l of tBP and subjected to temperature of 85 C for 120 h to understand the molecular structure of the organic component of the film as shown in figure 13  Two functional groups from methylammonium were identified as methyl and ammonium functional groups  The methyl vibration bands were assigned to rocking at 910 and C–H scissoring at 1470  The ammonium vibration bands were also assigned to N–H wagging at 660  rocking at 947  961 and 1252  scissoring at 1654 and N–H stretching at 3208 [ 16  25  26 ]  The intensities of ammonium bands in the degraded sample decreased at 660  947 and 1654 when compared with the methyl bands  This shows that the concentration of functional groups in the sample decreases in magnitude at a higher rate than that of methyl functional groups  This could be due to conversion of ammonium molecules to amines that leads to deprotonation process  The decrease in the concentration of shows that N–H bonds are weakest connections in perovskite structure  Also  and I have boiling points of –3334 and 4243 C  respectively  The ammonium bond brakes faster than methyl iodide [ 27 ] and leads to decrease in N–H bonds  The sample degraded for 120 h shows no significant decrease in the peaks when compared to freshly prepared sample  This supports that the sample treated with 100 μ l of tBP resists degradation of the film when exposed to temperature of 85 C for 120 h 4 Conclusions Due to impediment of performance instability in PSCs  they have not been practically deployed in PV applications  Encapsulation and surface passivation of the films using hydrophobic molecules have been used as methods of stabilizing the films but the challenge remains  In this work  perovskite films prepared through spin-coating technique were synthesized and the degradation of the as-prepared and aged films treated with tBP was studied for 120 h against temperature in a temperature-controlled chamber  The surface-modified films resisted temperature degradation more than the as-prepared film at 85 C than at 55 C It shows that the films have more adverse effect of degradation with temperature at 85 C than at 55 C Based on the findings from the research  100 μ of tBP reduced the rapid degradation of the perovskite films for 120 h This shows that incorporation of tBP on the surface of and then helps reduce degradation of perovskite films  This low-cost method could be deployed in real PV commercial applicationCritical Properties of Perovskite Manganese Oxides Pr1−xBaxMnO3 Original Paper Published : 25 April 2019 Volume 32  pages 3355–3359  ( 2019 ) Cite this

properties of polycrystalline Pr1−xBaxMnO3 ( x = 013 and 023 ) samples prepared by using a standard ceramic fabrication method were investigated  Pr1−xBaxMnO3 exhibited a second-order magnetic transition  As per the modified Arrott plot method and double logarithmic M-μ0H curve  the critical exponents ( CE ) were calculated as β = 0459 ± 003  γ = 1346 ± 002  δ = 432 ± 004  and TC ≈ 130 K  for x = 013  and β = 0424 ± 003  γ = 1362 ± 002  δ = 419  ± 003  and TC ≈ 163 K  for x = 023  To confirm the reliability of such CE values  the M ( H ) data of Pr1−xBaxMnO3 were checked by the scaling equation M ( H  t ) = tβf± ( H/tβ + γ )  where  ( t=frac { T } { T_C } -1  ) refers to the reduced temperature  f± is the scaling function above ( + ) /below ( − ) TC  The β values for Pr1−xBaxMnO3 ( x = 013 and 023 ) are between β = 0365 ( 3D Heisenberg exponent ) and β = 05 ( mean-field exponent )  whereas γ values are fairly close to γ = 1386  This reveals long- and short-range order coexisting

ABO3-type manganese oxides RE1−xAxMnO3 ( RE3+ = La3+  Nd3+  Sm3+  etc  ; A2+ = Sr2+  Ba2+  Pb2+  etc  ) near the phase transformation point ( TC ) are widely studied [ 123456 ]  Currently  the magnetic and electrical behaviors in such manganites are roughly interpreted using the double-exchange ( DE ) theory [ 7 ]  In addition  there are some other theories that are competitive with the DE interaction consisting of Jahn-Teller effects [ 8 ]  the anti-ferromagnetic super-exchange ( SE ) interaction  orbital  and charge ordering [ 9 ]  Thus  magnetic and electrical behaviors depend strongly on < Mn-O > distance  Mn3+–O–Mn4+ angle and Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio  Among hole-doped manganese oxides  Pr1−xBaxMnO3 displays both colossal magnetoresistance and a large magnetocaloric effect  and as such attracted great interest [ 101112 ]  For example  Trukhanov et al  [ 10 ] reported the magnetization and magnetoresistance of Pr1−xBaxMnO3  Savosta et al  [ 11 ] investigated the NMR spectra in Pr1−xBaxMnO3  Varvescu et al  [ 12 ] observed that the Pr067Ba033MnO3 exhibits a large  ( mid varDelta { S } _M^ { mathrm { max } } mid  ) = 550 J/kg K under μ0H = 4T  Moreover  Pr1−xBaxMnO3 has many potential applications in solid fuel cells  read-write heads  infrared sensors  and spintronic devices [ 101112 ]  Although the magnetic and electric performance of Pr1−xBaxMnO3 is widely reported in the literature  the investigation of critical behavior in Pr1−xBaxMnO3 is still deficient  Studying the critical properties is of extremely important  since establishing the universality class provides information on the range of the magnetic interactions  from which one can draw inferences about the likely interactions [ 13 ]  Here  critical behavior of Pr1−xBaxMnO3 ( x = 013 and 023 ) is investigated using static magnetization measurements  2 Experimental Details Employing traditional ceramic procedures  Pr1−xBaxMnO3 ( x = 013 and 023 ) powders were fabricated  Stoichiometric ratios of Pr6O11  BaCO3  and MnCO3 were mixed and subsequently heated to 1000 °C for 20 h Then  they were ground and heated to 1250 °C for 30 h The obtained powders were repeatedly ground and calcined at 1350 °C for 30 h To characterize the Pr1−xBaxMnO3  X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) was performed with the help of a Rigaku D/Max 2400 diffractometer ( λ = 154056 Å )  A commercial magnetometer ( Quantum Design MPMS XL-7 ) was used to obtain the magnetic behavior of the Pr1−xBaxMnO3  3 Results and Discussion Figure 1 shows the XRD spectra of the Pr1−xBaxMnO3 ( x = 013 and 023 )  All samples showed a single phase  polycrystalline specimens  and all the diffraction peaks are indexed by orthorhombic pervoksite structure belonging to Pbnm symmetry  Fig  1 figure 1 XRD patterns for Pr1−xBaxMnO3 Full size image To investigate the FM ( ferromagnetic ) -PM ( paramagnetic ) transformation  the magnetic field ( H ) dependences of magnetization ( M ) for Pr1−xBaxMnO3 ( x = 013 and 023 ) were recorded  as shown in Fig  2  and the corresponding M2 vs H/M curves ( nominal Arrott plots ) presented in Fig  3  From Arrott plots  two conclusions can be obtained : firstly  the magnetic transformation in Pr1−xBaxMnO3 belongs to the second-order type due to the positive slope [ 14 ] ; secondly  as Arrott plots exhibit non-parallel and nonlinear characteristics  the mean-field theory is not suitable for describing the critical behavior of Pr1−xBaxMnO3 [ 14 ]  Fig  2 figure 2 The initial magnetization for Pr1−xBaxMnO3 with x = 013 ( a ) and x = 023 ( b ) Full size image Fig  3 figure 3 Arrott plots for Pr1−xBaxMnO3 with x = 013 ( a ) and x = 023 ( b ) Full size image As per the scaling theory  the critical properties of materials belonging to second-order are normally characterized using three CE ( critical exponents )  β  γ  and δ [ 15 ]  which are associated with MS ( spontaneous magnetization )  χ0−1 ( inversely initial susceptibility )  and M ( H ) at Curie point  respectively  through the below relations [ 16 ] : $ $ { M } _S ( T ) propto { lefttright } ^ { beta }  t < 0 $ $ ( 1 ) $ $ { chi } _0^ { -1 } ( T ) propto { t } ^ { gamma }  t > 0 $ $ ( 2 ) $ $ Mpropto { H } ^ { 1/delta }  t=0  $ $ ( 3 ) where  ( t=frac { T- { T } _C } { T_C }  ) represents the reduced temperature  To achieve the precise CE of Pr1−xBaxMnO3  the MAP ( modified Arrott plots ) approach was employed as per the Arrott and Noakes equation [ 17 ]  The nonlinear fitting process involved first constructing MAP curves through adopting Heisenberg exponents ( initial values β = 0365  γ = 1386 ) in three dimensions [ 18 ]  Secondly  MS ( T ) and χ0−1 ( T ) data was extracted using the linearly extrapolated method  Lastly  by fitting the Ms vs t for t < 0 and χ0−1 vs t for t > 0  the new values of β and γ were calculated and new circles of fitting continued to reach optimum values  Admissible CE and TC values β = 0459 ± 003  γ = 1346 ± 002  and TC ≈ 130 K  for x = 013 ; and β = 0424 ± 003  γ = 1362 ± 002  and TC ≈ 163 K  for x = 023  are depicted in Fig  4  Fig  4 figure 4 Temperature-dependent MS ( T ) and  ( { chi } _0^ { -1 } ( T )  ) according to Eqs  ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) for Pr1−xBaxMnO3 with x = 013 ( a ) and x = 023 ( b ) ( the red curves are fitted ) Full size image Figure 5 panels ( a ) and ( b ) show the isotherm M ( H  T = TC ) versus H plot ( nominal critical isothermal analysis ( CIA ) ) on the double logarithmic scale for the x = 013 and 023  respectively  Based on Eq  ( 3 )  a logM vs log ( μ0H ) linear fitting provides δ = 432 ± 004 for x = 013  and δ = 419  ± 003 for x = 023  Moreover  as per Widom ’ s theory [ 19 ]  expressed in Eq  ( 4 )  $ $ delta =1+gamma /beta $ $ ( 4 ) Fig  5 figure 5 M ( TC  H ) vs μ0H plot for Pr1−xBaxMnO3 with ( a ) x = 013 and ( b ) x = 023 on double logarithmic scale as per Eq  ( 3 ) near TC for the exponent δ Full size image Values of δ = 441 for x = 013 and δ = 422 for x = 023 can be achieved  These values were commensurate with those deduced from Fig  5  and thus the estimated β and γ values are reasonable  The CE values determined above were tested by the scaling analysis via the static-scaling hypothesis  which relates M to t and H [ 20 ] as follows : $ $ Mleft ( H  varepsilon right ) = { lefttright } ^ { beta } { f } _ { pm } left ( H/ { lefttright } ^ { beta +gamma } right )  $ $ ( 5 ) where f± is the function above ( + ) /below ( − ) TC  This generates two sets of universal branches : one for T lower than TC  and one for T higher than TC [ 20 ]  For improved clarity  Mt−β against Ht− ( β + γ ) curves are depicted in Fig  6 on a double logarithmic scale  All data clearly merged into either T < TC or T > TC [ 20 ] categories  indicating the CE and TC as self-consistent  Fig  6 figure 6 Scaling curves for the Pr1−xBaxMnO3 with x = 013 ( a ) and x = 023 ( b ) on a double logarithmic scale Full size image To further investigate the critical phenomena of Pr1−xBaxMnO3  the results were compared to the theoretical values of classic models and previous report on Pr1−xBaxMnO3 manganites ( Table 1 )  The values of β = 0459 ± 003 for x = 013 and β = 0424 ± 003 for x = 023 were close to β = 05 ( mean-field exponent )  Such phenomenon was also observed in Pr05Sr05MnO3 [ 21 ] and La09Pb01MnO3 [ 22 ]  In contrast  the values of γ = 1346 for x = 013 and γ = 1362 for x = 023 deviate from γ = 1 ; and in fact closer to 3D-Heisenberg exponent γ = 1386  The results suggest the following with regard to magnetic interaction in Pr1−xBaxMnO3 ( x = 013 and 023 )  Firstly  a short-range ordering was not evident in Pr1−xBaxMnO3 ( x = 013 and 023 )  Secondly  as CE values are between the 3D-Heisbenberg and mean-field models  magnetic interactions likely belong to an extended type  Such phenomenon reveals both long- and short-range order coexisting in Pr1−xBaxMnO3  Lastly  increasing barium content likely increases short-range order  In short  critical properties of Pr1−xBaxMnO3 ( x = 013 and 023 ) do not describe by the existing universality classes  and probably belongs to a separate class  Hence  further experimental and theoretical efforts are required  Future work will focus on critical exponents of Pr1−xBaxMnO3 as per field-dependent magnetic entropy change  Table 1 Critical parameters of Pr1−xBaxMnO3 ( x = 013 and 023 ) compared with those obtained from different theoretical models Full size table 4 Conclusion In summary  Pr1−xBaxMnO3 polycrystalline samples were synthesized via a solid-state reaction  Reliable critical exponents of β = 0459 ± 003 for x = 013  and β = 0424 ± 003 for x = 023 are between theoretical values of the 3D-Heisenberg ( β = 0365 ) and the mean field ( β = 05 ) models  Importantly  the values of γ = 1346 for x = 013 and γ = 1362 for x = 023 match well with the 3D-Heisenberg model  These results confirmed the coexistence of ferromagnetic long- and short-range order in Pr1−xBaxMnO3  ReferencesLow-Temperature Aging Provides 22 %

step or layer is needed  The efficiency of planar perovskite solar cells is improved to 2241 % with robust reproducibility  Abstract Previous reports of formamidinium/methylamine ( FAMA ) -mixed halide perovskite solar cells have focused mainly on controlling the morphology of the perovskite film and its interface—for example  through the inclusion of bromine and surface passivation  In this paper  we describe a new processing pathway for the growth of a high-quality bromine-free FAMAPbI3 halide perovskites via the control of intermediate phase  Through low-temperature aging growth ( LTAG ) of a freshly deposited perovskite film  α-phase perovskites can be seeded in the intermediate phase and  at the same time  prevent beta-phase perovskite to nucleate  After postannealing  large grain-size perovskites with significantly reduced PbI2 presence on the surface can be obtained  thereby eliminating the need of additional surface passivation step  Our pristine LTAG-treated solar cells could provide PCEs of greater than 22 % without elaborate use of bromine or an additional passivation layer  More importantly  when using this LTAG process  the growth of the pure alpha-phase FAMAPbI3 was highly reproducible  Similar content being viewed by others Reduction of bulk and surface defects in inverted methylammonium- and bromide-free formamidinium perovskite solar cells Article

attention for their dramatic improvements in efficiency—from 38 % [ 1 ] to over 24 % —in less than a decade [ 2 ]  their low manufacturing costs  and their ease of solution processing  To promote the device performance of PSCs beyond 20 %  several techniques have been investigated  including variations in composition [ 345 ]  control over the perovskite film growth [ 6789 ]  interface engineering [ 101112 ]  the use of additives [ 131415 ]  ionic liquid technique [ 16 ]  and surface passivation [ 171819 ]  Among the perovskite materials currently being investigated  the low-band-gap α-phase formamidinium lead iodide ( FAPbI3 ) perovskite  which possesses an ideal band gap of 148 eV and extended light absorption to 840 nm [ 202122 ]  appears to have the most promising perovskite composition to achieve record-breaking photocurrent densities and power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) [ 2324252627 ]  Nevertheless  obtaining the α-phase FAPbI3 in its pure composition is difficult through either one-step anti-solvent deposition or the two-step sequential method [ 15  282930 ]  Therefore  mixed cation and inclusion of bromine have been employed to stabilize the α-phase FAPbI3 and  thereby  obtain device performances exceeding 21 % [ 313233 ]  Unfortunately  the inclusion of bromine also results in unwanted changes in the composition of the perovskite and contributes to a narrower absorption spectrum  Thus  many attempts have been made toward achieving bromine-free  pure α-phase FAPbI3-based solar cells without compromising the intrinsic properties of the FAPbI3 perovskite [ 34353637 ]  Two-step sequential deposition methods are the most effective methods for preparing FA-based halide perovskite films in planar n–i–p structures [ 8  27  34 ]  Previous studies have demonstrated that high-quality perovskite films can be obtained in the presence of moderate amounts of humidity [ 5  38 ]  Interesti excess lead iodide ( PbI2 ) also forms during the growth of perovskite films  which originates from the precursor ingredient and decomposes when high-temperature postannealing of the perovskite film is performed in air [ 394041 ]  Some studies have found that the PbI2 by-product has a beneficial effect by passivating the grain boundary defects inside the perovskite film under certain conditions  thereby enhancing device efficiency [ 32  404142 ]  For example  a small amount of PbI2 can passivate the defects on the interface between the perovskite layer ( PVK ) and the hole-transporting layer ( HTL )  thus improving device efficiency and eliminating the hysteresis effect [ 31  33  43 ]  Nevertheless  excess PbI2 has negative effects  For instance  if too much PbI2 separates out from the perovskite film surface  the thick PbI2 layer may itself function as an insulating layer with increased defect density  rather than acting as a passivation layer [ 444546 ]  Therefore  devices prepared with an excess of PbI2 often have lower open-circuit voltages ( Voc ) and undergo faster photodegradation  compared to PbI2-deficient devices [ 4445464748 ]  Therefore  it is necessary to optimize the amount of PbI2 at the PVK–HTL interface to passivate the interface defect states and  thereby  facilitate charge transport  In several recent studies  efforts have been devoted toward optimizing the passivation layer on the top surface of the perovskite film to remove the excess PbI2  by using various passivators  including organic halide salts  For example  Zhu et al  achieved a high value of Voc of 121 V when using guanidinium bromide salts on a control perovskite film ; here  the excess PbI2/PbBr2 crystals were “ digested ” with the assistance of the guanidinium bromide [ 48 ]  You et al  recovered the contact energy loss and obtained a certified quasi-steady-state efficiency of 2332 % after passivating excess PbI2 crystals on perovskite film surface with the organic cationic salt of PEAI [ 34 ]  Furthermore  negative effects on the underlying perovskite layer have also been found when an inappropriate solvent or layer thickness was used for the passivation layer [ 17 ]  To date  the working mechanism of the passivation layer remains unclear  Determining when to use a passivator  or which passivator to use in a given system  with the hope of reducing the effect of excess PbI2 and mitigating non-radiative recombination  can still be a challenge  Developing a passivation layer-free method is important for the fabrication of perovskite layer to be flexible in terms of controlling the ideal amount of PbI2 for the self-passivation of surface defects  while also ensuring that the process is simple and reproducible  In this paper  we proposed a new method  involving low-temperature aging growth ( LTAG ) prior to thermal annealing  for the production of high-quality bromine-free perovskite films  with control over the composition of PbI2  from FA1–xMAxPbI3 ( FA : HC ( NH2 ) 2  MA : CH3NH3  hereafter denoted “ FAMAPbI3″ ) perovskites for planar n–i–p-type solar cells  We demonstrate that an optimized residual content of PbI2 on the FAMAPbI3 perovskite film surface can be obtained after aging the as-formed perovskite film at low temperature under N2 ( in a glove box ) and annealing in air at a certain relative humidity ( RH  30–40 % )  Unlike conventional processes that utilize bromine and often lead to a large amount of excess PbI2 on the top surface  the perovskite films produced using this LTAG method feature with a fine amount of PbI2 crystals between the grain boundaries and much lower PbI2 contents on the top surface  Analyses using time-resolved photoluminescence ( TRPL ) spectroscopy  the space charge-limited current ( SCLC ) method  ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometry ( UPS )  and atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) revealed excellent charge transport and suppressed non-radiative losses at the PVK–HTL interfaces of our LTAG-treated samples  As a result  our champion LTAG devices achieved a record-high PCE-2241 % for a bromine-free FAMAPbI3 perovskite  Without the need for additional processing steps to modify the problematic PbI2 layer  our present LTAG method can produce suitable amounts of PbI2 on the top surface of the perovskite layer to provide stable PSC devices exhibiting high efficiency and excellent reproducibility  2 Experimental Section 21 Materials

robust preparation method without bromine is highly desirable to provide devices with higher photocurrent  A new two-step sequential method is presented here to deposit a bromine-free FAMAPbI3 perovskite absorber film  As displayed in Fig  1a  in the conventional two-step method  PbI2 is dissolved in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO  The first step involves formation of a PbI2–DMSO film  In the second step  a solution of the mixed organic FAI and MAI is applied  such that critical intramolecular exchange occurs with the PbI2–DMSO film to form an intermediate-phase FAI–MAI-PbI2–DMSO film [ 26 ]  Typically  the brown fresh film is directly subjected to high-temperature annealing in air at a controlled humidity ( RH  30–40 % ) to allow the highly crystallized perovskite films to form [ 6 ]  However  the freshly prepared intermediate film usually transforms  within approximately 10 s  into a yellow δ-phase FAMAPbI3 when exposed to air  resulting in a white or opaque surface for final perovskite film ( Fig  S1 )  As reported previously [ 49 ]  the intermediate phase is a layered-structure film that lacks an exact composition  If it is not handled properly  this intermediate phase is highly unstable which can cause problems in the following perovskite crystallization process  Fig  1 figure 1 a Schematic representation of the film crystallization process of an LTAG-based FAMAPbI3 perovskite layer  b XRD patterns of the as-formed films obtained using the control process and the LTAG method  &  α  δ  ∇ Mean characteristic diffraction signals of the PbI2  black

film  d XRD patterns of annealed perovskite layers prepared without ( control ) and with LTAG treatment ( at 30  50  and 70 °C ) Full size image In our LTAG method  as displayed in Fig  1a  the freshly coated intermediate-phase brown film is first left on a hot plate and aged at various low temperatures for 5 min  Specifically  the low-temperature aging is set at 30  50  and 70 °C for LTAG-30  LTAG-50  and LTAG-70  respectively  Then  the as-formed aged film is then baked on a hot plate at 150 °C for 15 min to produce the α-phase perovskite film ( Fig  S2 )  To study the mechanism of LTAG process  we performed XRD patterns of the as-formed intermediate-phase films for control and LTAG method ( at 30  50  and 70 °C ) after the exposure to air but prior to final high-temperature annealing  as shown in Fig  1b  For the control film without LTAG treatment  the intermediate phase peaked at 93° is clearly observed [ 29  50 ]  The undesired δ-phase perovskite peaked at 116° is  however  dramatically high  indicating the existence of δ-phase perovskite inside intermediate film  In LTAG-based film  as displayed in Fig  1b  no signal of δ-phase FAMAPbI3 is found at 116°  The signals at 93° and 13° for LTAG-30 indicate that the intermediate phase is well kept for the aging temperature at 30 °C  More importantly  α-phase FAMAPbI3 peaked at 1394° starts to appear in the intermediate phase after LTAG treatment  indicating LTAG can precrystallize α-phase perovskite [ 515253 ]  With increases of aging temperature to 50 and 70 °C  the PbI2 peak at 127° starts to exist  This shows that the intermediate phase is volatile and can easily turn into yellow δ-perovskite phase in the control film  but with the help of LTAG the intermediate film is more likely to nucleate α-phase perovskite  To further certify this phenomenon  Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR ) was performed and results are shown in Fig  1c  The characteristic peak in 1016 cm−1 represents S = O stretch  indicating the intermediate FAI–MAI-PbI2–DMSO phase from the coordination between DMSO and MA+  FA+  and Pb2+ ions [ 29  50 ]  For control film  the intermediate FAI-MAI-PbI2-DMSO phase exists  and the intensity of intermediate phase decreases when the aging temperature increases and disappears at the temperature of 70 °C  These results indicate that LTAG process can avoid the formation of yellow δ-phase FAMAPbI3 as compared to control process  The conversion of the intermediate-phase film to α-phase perovskite is more thorough by releasing the residual complex compositions ( eg  IPA  MAI  or MACl ) in the intermediate film beforehand  In other words  LTAG process can help the intermediate phase to start nucleating α-phase perovskite at low aging temperature and finish the conversion to α-phase perovskite during high-temperature postannealing  Figure 1d presents XRD patterns of the postannealed perovskite films prepared using various aging temperatures  All of the samples exhibited characteristic peaks at 127° and 1394°  which were assigned to PbI2 and α-phase perovskite  corresponding to their ( 001 ) and ( 100 ) reflections  respectively ( Fig  S3 ) [ 7 ]  The intensity of the PbI2 diffraction peak was remarkably high in the XRD pattern of the control sample  In this case  the PbI2 diffraction peak was even stronger than that of the perovskite peak  For the LTAG samples  the intensity ratios of the PbI2 ( 001 ) and perovskite ( 100 ) signals were much lower than that for the control sample  For low-temperature aging at 30 °C  the intensity of the PbI2 peak was the lowest among all of our tested samples  The intensity of the PbI2 peak got stronger with increasing temperature of LTAG method  which was also in consistence with the previous results from XRD and FTIR in the as-prepared films  In other words  the existence of δ-phase in the as-prepared intermediate phase from control process may cause an incomplete conversion of δ-phase to α-phase perovskites  thereby inducing mass nucleation of PbI2 in the meantime  When using the LTAG method  the α-phase perovskites already precrystallized in the as-prepared intermediate films can help form highly crystallized α-phase perovskite in postannealing step and  at the same time  reduce the presence of PbI2  which is critically important for the later preparation of high-performance devices [ 54 ]  To examine the amount of excess PbI2  we recorded SEM images of the top surfaces of thermally postannealed perovskite films—one prepared without aging  hereafter denoted as the control sample/film  and three prepared using the LTAG method with aging at temperatures of 30  50  and 70 °C  hereafter denoted as LTAG-30  LTAG-50  and LTAG-70 samples/films  respectively  In Fig  2a  for the sample prepared without intermediate film aging  large amounts of bright crystals were present on the surface  In these bright crystals  the dense white areas were formed by PbI2  while the dark areas were the surrounding perovskite grains [ 6  31 ]  For the LTAG-based perovskite films ( Fig  2b–d )  the numbers of white PbI2 crystals decreased dramatically  The remaining PbI2 was distributed around the perovskite grain  suggesting a suppressed PbI2 formation when using the LTAG method  The LTAG-30 sample featured the minimum amount of PbI2 on the top surface ; here  the grain size of the perovskite had increased to 115 μm ( Fig  S4 )  The average grain-size distribution obtained from SEM images is exhibited in Fig  S5  indicating that LTAG treatment can restrain the PbI2 contents and induce a larger grain size of perovskite crystals as compared to that of control samples  These results are also in consistence with the cross-sectional SEM images for control and LTAG-30-treated devices in Fig  2e  f  an excess amount of PbI2 is evident on the top surface in control sample  but no PbI2 is visible on the top surface for LTAG-30 device  In other words  during the thermal postannealing recrystallization process  the formation of the perovskite crystals and the PbI2 crystals occurred simultaneously  The LTAG method appeared to seed α-phase perovskites in the intermediate phase and allow the α-phase perovskite crystal grains to grow into larger sizes  thereby limiting the formation of PbI2 at the surface  In addition  the red shift of absorption edges of LTAG-based perovskite films was observed ( Fig  S6 )  The visible band gap of the LTAG-based films was slightly shifted to a narrower band gap ( ca  153 eV )  Similar shift has also been found when the content of PbI2 was decreased on perovskite layer [ 33 ]  Fig  2 figure 2 Top-view SEM images of postdeposition annealed perovskite films : a control sample without aging  b LTAG-30-treated sample

Device Fabrication and Characterization We investigated the efficiencies of solar cells incorporating the perovskite films prepared under the various conditions  The control device and the LTAG-based devices  prepared using aging temperatures of 30  50  and 70 °C  were fabricated with the following planar configuration : indium tin oxide ( ITO ) /SnO2/FAMAPbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au  The thicknesses of the SnO2  FAMAPbI3 perovskite  and Spiro-OMeTAD layers  determined from cross-sectional SEM images  were 35  800  and 150 nm  respectively ( Fig  S7 )  Figure 3a presents the current density–voltage ( J–V ) curves plotted with respect to the aging temperature  Fig  3 figure 3 a J–V curves of devices prepared using the LTAG method ( at 30  50  and 70 °C )  compared with that of the control device  b

LTAG-30 device  measured close to the maximum power point Full size image Table 1 summarizes the average photovoltaic parameters obtained from 32 devices subjected to the aging treatment  When the aging temperature was set at 30 °C for LTAG-30  the average PCE of perovskite devices reaches the best performance of 214 %  Further increase in aging temperature to 50 and 70 °C did not continue to increase the performance but did not keep efficiency at 20 %  which is still greatly enhanced from that of the control devices at 189 % efficiency  Furthermore  30 °C is the optimal LTAG temperature attributing to its capability to keep the intermediate phase without drying it completely  The proof of this suggestion can be found in Fig  1b  The control devices provided a low PCE of 1975 %  an open-circuit voltage ( Voc ) of 106 V  a short-current current density ( Jsc ) of 2396 mA cm−2  and a fill factor ( FF ) of 077  The LTAG-based devices displayed significantly improved photovoltaic performance  particularly in terms of their values of Voc and Jsc  For example  the value of Jsc of the LTAG-30 sample could exceed 2440 mA cm−2—the highest measured in this study  The values of Voc obtained from the devices incorporating the LTAG-treated films that had been aged at 30  50  and 70 °C were 110  112  and 110 V  respectively  Table 1 Average and champion device performance parameters for solar cells processed using the controlled process ( control ) and the LTAG process ( 30  50  70 ) Full size table Furthermore  we studied the time effect of LTAG ( Figs  S8  S9  and Table S1 )  It was found that 5-min aging time is required to complete LTAG and obtain reduced PbI2 crystals  When aging time is prolonged over 5 min  there exhibited no significant difference on the morphology and corresponding device performance  These results suggest that decreasing and precisely controlling the PbI2 content significantly affected the device performance  Considering that a fine amount of PbI2 could act as a passivation agent for the grain boundary defects but not affect charge transport at the PVK–HTL contact  we could use the LTAG-30 device  which exhibited the highest performance  to define the optimal content of residual PbI2 in this study  Indeed  the LTAG-30 device exhibited the highest PCE of 2241 %  with a Voc of 112 V  a Jsc of 2479 mA cm−2  and an FF of 0807 ( Fig  3d )  Compared with the results reported previously for FAPbI3-based solar cells prepared without passivation layers ( Table S2 )  this device efficiency is the highest ever recorded for a bromine- and passivation layer-free planar-structure perovskite solar cells  Furthermore  we tested the device performance when LTAG-based film was annealed in the ambient under different humidity conditions and found that the corresponding device performance exhibited almost no decrease  indicating a better stability toward humidity as compared to the control devices which are found with a significant degradation under high humidity environment ( Fig  S10 )  We also tested the devices obtained after performing the aging growth under various atmospheres ( N2  Ar  and O2 ) ; Figure S11 and Table S3 present the corresponding photovoltaic parameters  which reveal that the aging growth treatment was the key factor  rather than the N2 atmosphere  promoting the greater device performance [ 55 ]  We attribute the enhancement in device performance to the lower residual PbI2  the enhanced light absorption  and the improved charge recombination  as inferred from the XRD  absorption spectral  and PL intensity data  To examine the hysteresis effects  we measured the J–V curves of the LTAG-based and control devices in reverse and forward scans  As shown in Fig  3b  the LTAG-30 device exhibited lower hysteresis  along with a lower H-index  relative to the control device ( Table S4 )  suggesting superior charge transfer from the PVK to the HTL in the LTAG-30 sample  Figure 3c presents the PCE distributions of the devices obtained using the LTAG and control methods  Table S5 summarizes the detailed parameters of the LTAG-30 cells  We obtained PSCs with a PCE of approximately 22 % and high reproducibility  for each of the devices obtained using the LTAG method  Figure 3e displays the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra and the integrated values of Jsc of the LTAG-30 champion device  The calculated value of Jsc of 2424 mA cm−2 matches well with the value measured ( 2479 mA cm−2 ) from the J–V curves  higher than that of the control device ( Fig  S12 )  Figure 3f reveals a stabilized steady-state efficiency of 2143 %  with a steady-state current density of 2224 mA cm−2 at a constant bias voltage of 096 V  for the best-performing LTAG-30 device  Figure S13 provides the corresponding data for the reference device  Furthermore  we examined the device stability at room temperature of the un-capsulated perovskite solar cells stored in a dry oven ( RH = 20 % ; Fig  S14 )  The LTAG-30 device retained 90 % of its initial PCE after 1800 h ; in contrast  the control device retained only 70 % of its initial PCE after the same duration  Accordingly  we conclude that decreasing the amount of residual PbI2 at the interface improved the device stability  possibly also by mitigating the ion migration of PbI2 across the interface  To investigate the dynamics of the photocarriers in these devices  and their relationship with the improvement in the value of Voc  we recorded steady-state PL spectra of the thermally postannealed perovskite films  Figure 4a reveals that the PL intensity increased dramatically for the LTAG-30-based film relative to the control sample  implying improved photocharge properties and a decrease in the amount of spontaneous non-radiative recombination from the surface traps in the LTAG samples  We also measured the TRPL spectrum ( Fig  4b ) as dots  which we fitted using a biexponential decay function ( solid lines ) featuring fast ( τ1 ) and slow ( τ2 ) decay times [ 56 ]  We derived average lifetime constants of 49781 and 84603 ns for the control and LTAG-30 films  respectively ( Table S6 )  The LTAG-based film possessed the longer average lifetime  indicating a decrease in its non-radiative recombination and potentially passivated surface traps  arising from the well-controlled residual PbI2 content across the perovskite layer surface  We used EIS to study the interfacial charge transfer properties  As displayed in Fig  4c  the high and low frequencies corresponded to the bulk transfer ( Rtr ) and interface recombination ( Rrec ) resistances in the perovskite device  respectively [ 57 ]  Compared with the control sample  we measured a lower value of Rtr and a higher value of Rrec in the LTAG sample ( Fig  S15  Table S7 )  suggesting that charge transfer across the bulk material and the contact interface had both improved in the LTAG-based device  Fig  4 figure 4 a Steady-state PL

LTAG-based perovskite devices in the dark  d Current–voltage curves and extracted defect densities of electron-only devices prepared using the control and LTAG-based methods ; insets : the single-carrier device structures Full size image We used the SCLC method to examine the decrease in the defect density for our devices  employing the following electron-only device configuration : ITO/SnO2/FAMAPbI3/PC61BM/Au  Figure 4d reveals three different regions in the logarithmic I–V curves : a linear ohmic region ( slope = 1 )  a nonlinear trap-filling region ( slope > 2 )  and a SCLC region ( slope = 2 ) [ 58 ]  Upon increasing the bias voltage in region 2  the trap-filled limit voltage ( VTFL ) was reached when all of the traps were filled  and the defect density ( Nt ) could be calculated from Eq  1 [ 58 ] : ( 1 ) where εr is the relative permittivity of perovskite material ( εr = 32 ) [ 9  59 ]  ε0 is the vacuum permittivity ( ε0 = 885 × 10−12 F m−1 )  e is the electron charge  and L is the thickness of perovskite film ( L = 800 nm ) in the devices [ 60 ]  The value of VTFL decreased from 073 to 060 V after performing the aging treatment ; the estimated defect density of 497 × 1015 cm−3 for the LTAG-based device was lower than that for the control reference ( 605 × 1015 cm−3 )  This finding suggests that effective self-passivation had occurred and  thus  the number of traps had decreased  This phenomenon contributed to the observed higher values of Voc  which led to the higher PCEs  of the LTAG-based solar cells [ 61 ]  Energy band alignment between the perovskite and transport layers is crucial to avoiding non-radiative recombination and Voc loss at the interface [ 62  63 ]  To examine the intrinsic cause of the improvement in the value of Voc after the aging growth treatment  we used UPS to examine the electronic structure of the perovskite layers  Figure S16 presents the electronic properties of the control sample featuring an excess of residual PbI2 and of the LTAG sample featuring the fine residual PbI2  From the cutoff region  we found that the work functions ( WFs ) increased from − 40 V for the control film to − 39 eV for the LTAG-based film  The valence band energies ( EVB ) of control and LTAG-based films were − 591 and − 586 eV  respectively  The slight increase in the value of EVB upon decreasing the amount of residual PbI2 presumably led to a better match with the reported value of Spiro-OMeTAD ( − 522 eV )  resulting in enhanced hole transport from the perovskite to the HTL and minimized carrier recombination [ 64 ]  both contributing partially to the improved values of Voc of our LTAG-based devices  To identify the surface defects  we applied conductive atomic force microscopy ( c-AFM ) in dark to detect the phase and potential differences of the perovskite films  Figure 5a  b presents AFM phase images of the control and LTAG films  respectively  For the control film  the white PbI2 phases had aggregated and were common on the top surface  In contrast  in the LTAG film  the crystal grains of the perovskite ( observed with a dark color ) were common on the top surface  with the white PbI2 phase likely present in the grain boundary areas  Figure 5c  d presents two-dimensional ( 2D ) surface potential spatial maps of the control and LTAG films  respectively  The potential distribution in the control perovskite film is discontinuous and surrounded by the separated white areas  suggesting high surface potential barriers exist between perovskite crystals and grain boundaries due to the excess amount of PbI2 on the perovskite surface  However  the film provided by the LTAG method shows a relatively uniform potential distribution across the perovskite surface without any remarkable dots  indicating that a minimized surface potential barrier exists between the perovskite crystals and grain boundaries  The potential barrier between the perovskite grain and grain boundary can cause a significant influence on the carrier transfer [ 65 ]  For the control film  the surface potential of the separated white areas of PbI2 was 40 mV higher than that of the dark areas of the bulk perovskite  indicating severe charge trapping in the PbI2 areas  For the LTAG film  the film surface potential difference between the PbI2 and the bulk perovskite was much lower  at 15 mV  revealing that the self-passivation of PbI2 was highly effective and that charge trapping at the grain boundaries had been alleviated  This improvement resulted from the decreased presence of PbI2 phases on top of the perovskite phases  enhancing the carrier transporting capability [ 39  66 ]  These results are consistent with our experimental observations from the TRPL  EIS  SCLC  and UPS analyses  which suggested that LTAG treatment improved the values of Voc and  thereby  the performance of the photovoltaic devices  Fig  5 figure 5 a  b AFM phase images and c  d 2D surface potential spatial maps of a  c the control perovskite film and b  d the perovskite film prepared through LTAG at 30 °C Full size image 4 Conclusions We have demonstrated that preannealing through an LTAG method produces highly crystallized and bromine-free FAMAPbI3 perovskite films  with control over the content of PbI2  In LTAG method  the composition of as-prepared intermediate film is optimized by inhibiting the formation of δ-phase perovskite and allowing α-phase perovskite to nucleate  Thereby  when postannealing is applied  seeded α-phase perovskites can easily turn into large grain-sized perovskites with suppressed PbI2 formation  This process readily optimizes the levels of PbI2 at the interface between the perovskite and the HTL and at the grain boundaries  resulting in effective self-passivation of grain boundary defects and lowering of the PVK/HTL contact resistance  Moreover  the corresponding LTAG-based devices exhibited superior PCEs of up to 2241 % with increased Voc of up to 112 V  high reproducibility and low hysteresis  The small residual amount of PbI2 created through the LTAG process was beneficial to decreasing the recombination loss on the top perovskite surface without requiring the use of an additional passivation layer or passivation agents  which may have negative effects  Therefore  this method of preannealing low-temperature aging is a simple process that provides highly efficient and reproducible low-band-gap FAMAPbI3 PSCs  Referencesultiple negative differential resistance in perovskite ( CH3NH3PbI3 ) decorated electrospun TiO2 nanofibers Published :

for storage purpose has seen huge growth  Because of their low power consumption  non-volatile nature and simple device structures  memristors are considered to be one of the most promising devices for advanced electronic applications  The memristor behaviour was first discovered by L Chau in 1971 [ 1 ]  Although there are various kinds of memory devices  one of the most prominent memory devices is the random-access memory ( RAM ) which is based on resistive switching ( RS ) that is it can switch between high resistance state ( HRS ) and low resistance state ( LRS )  This process of switching between different resistive/ conductive states is termed as electrical bistability [ 2 ]  Resistive switching ( RS ) also plays a key role in memristive applications to save information  However  the coexistence of RS and negative differential resistance ( NDR ) due to the coextensive phenomena of polarities makes it even more attractive  Generally  the current increases with the bias voltage  whereas for NDR the current decreases with an increase in the bias voltage  The co-occurrence of unipolarity  bipolarity and non-polarity in the semiconducting materials like TiO2  ZnO etc  is of great interest in the field of RS and NDR [ 3  4 ]  For a stable and reversible coexistence of RS and NDR  it requires exceptional conditions which would limit its practical application  So fabrication of such electrical devices which would be operational under room temperature is of great significance  Titanium dioxide ( TiO2 ) is a promising material as a semiconductor and has very high germaneness in photovoltaic and electrochemical devices  It has attracted much attention due to its various applications in our daily use such as paints  synthetic fibres  ceramics  self-cleaning coatings  electronic components along with food and cosmetics  TiO2 has been mass-produced as nanoparticles due to its low cost  nontoxicity  chemical/photostability and strong oxidizing power when compared to bulk particles [ 5678 ]  TiO2 exists in various phases namely anatase  rutile and brookite where anatase plays an important role in energy storage and environmental applications [ 9 ]  To synthesize TiO2 without loss of crystallinity  alteration of morphology  controlled particle size and high surface area  several methods such as hydrothermal route  sol–gel  doping etc  have been used so far [ 10111213 ]  But these methods involve the use of acids  toxic reagents and organic solvents which are very harmful and less eco-friendly  Electrospinning is an old technique which is a simple  inexpensive nanofiber processing method  In recent years  this technique allows the easy synthesis of nanofibers which are used in various applications like solar cells  supercapacitors  fuel cells and energy storage devices [ 1415161718 ]  Since the nanofibers have various applications  in future  a single nanofiber can be used as an electronic device  The electrical properties of TiO2 nanofiber can be enhanced by compounds like cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ( CTAB ) [ 19 ]  In solar cells  the efficiency can be increased using TiO2 as the electron transport layer as it blocks the holes and allows only electrons to pass through  Therefore  to increase the electrical properties of TiO2 nanofiber suitable organic compound such as MEH-PPV [ 20 ]  perovskite [ 21 ]  P3HT [ 22 ]  etc  can be used  Among these  perovskite has high electronic conductivity  photocatalytic nature  thermal and chemical stability and dielectric properties [ 23 ]  NDR phenomenon has been found in many various photoactive materials like hybrid perovskite devices fabricated by solution-based methods [ 24  25 ]  Hence  the efficiency of the photovoltaic device can be increased by decorating perovskite over TiO2 nanofiber  In this work  we have studied the electrical properties and multiple NDR effect in self-standing TiO2 nanofibrous mat decorated with perovskite by simple chemical bath depositions in room temperature  We also have discussed how this NDR could be utilized for memory applications in perovskite decorated PVA-TiO2 mat  2 Experimental section 21 Materials PbI2 ( 99 %  Sigma-Aldrich )  CH3NH3I ( > 98 %  Sigma-Aldrich )  N  N-Dimethylformamide LR ( 99 %  SD fine-chem limited )  Dimethyl sulphoxide LR ( 99 %  SD fine-chem limited )  poly ( vinyl alcohol ) ( PVA ) ( 99 %  Sigma-Aldrich ) ( Mw = 50000–85000 )  TiO2 nanopowder ( < 25 nm  anatase  997 %  Sigma-Aldrich )  Since TiO2 nanoparticles were purchased readymade from Sigma-Aldrich company  no characterization of the particle morphology  size and material specification was further done  The specification sheet of the product provided by the company was consulted to determine the TiO2 nanoparticle related characterizations  Indium tin oxide ( ITO ) coated glass substrates ( 16–18 Ω/sq ) were supplied from BAT-SOL industry  22 Synthesis of PVA-TiO2 mat The PVA-TiO2 mat was prepared by dissolving 8 wt % ( 08 g ) of PVA in 10 ml of distilled water and was stirred for 5 h under 60 °C to obtain a homogenous solution  At room temperature  to the polymer solution  a 4 wt % ( 04 g ) of TiO2 was added and the mixture was stirred overnight  The homogeneous TiO2 polymer solution was then electrospun from E-SPIN nano electrospinning set up from Physics Equipment Company  20 kV was supplied between the collector and the syringe  The distance between the collector and the syringe was kept at 12 cm and the flow rate was maintained at 1 ml/h  The PVA-TiO2 nanofiber was collected on a glass plate  The thickness of this PVA-TiO2 mat was presumably ~ 150 µm  23 Preparation of perovskite solution 198 mg of methyl ammonium iodide was added to 05 ml of Dimethyl sulphoxide LR solution and 576 mg of PbI2 was added to 05 ml of N  N-Dimethylformamide LR solution separately  Both the solutions were placed separately and sonicated for 10 min  It was then mixed to form a perovskite precursor solution  24 Fabrication of Perovskite decorated PVA-TiO2 mat The fabricated PVA-TiO2 mat was immersed in the solution of perovskite for 2 min in a Petri dish  It was then dried and placed in between two ITO plates  A voltage of − 05 to + 2 V was applied at both the ends of the device and current–voltage characteristics were determined  25 Characterization The PVA/TiO2 composite nanofibers were characterized by SEM  FTIR and XRD  Morphologies of the TiO2 mat were identified by Zeiss Evo18 Scanning Electron Microscope  The X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) of the pristine PVA-TiO2 mat and perovskite decorated PVA-TiO2 mat were recorded at room temperature using X-ray diffraction PANANALYTICAL XPERT3  Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR ) was observed from Thermo Scientific Nicolet IS10 IR  The current–voltage characterization was carried out with a Keithley 2450 source measure unit  The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS ) after the on-state and off-state was measured using ZIVE SP1 Potentiostat/Galvanostat/EIS electrochemical workstation  3 Results and discussion 31 XRD analysis The X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) pattern of the synthesized PVA-TiO2 mat and perovskite decorated PVA-TiO2 mat is shown in Fig  1a and b  The XRD patterns from Fig  1a were in correlation with the JCPDS Card No  21-1272 of anatase TiO2  The structure of the TiO2 nanoparticles does not get altered even if it is blended with PVA after the formation of composite nanofibers [ 26 ]  It is seen that the XRD pattern of both the nanofibers are not identical and few sharp peaks can be observed  The diffraction pattern of the nanoparticle TiO2 reveals the presence of TiO2 and semi-crystalline structure of PVA with major diffraction peaks at 254°  38°  431°  48°  539°  55°  575°  626°  647°  687°  703°  750°  839° corresponding to ( 101 )  ( 004 )  ( 202 )  ( 200 )  ( 105 )  ( 211 )  ( 018 )  ( 204 )  ( 125 )  ( 116 )  ( 220 )  ( 215 )  ( 303 ) planes  respectively  The peak observed at 2θ = 254° shows the anatase phase of TiO2  The overall peaks in this XRD pattern display a deep fall in the crystalline structure of PVA on the addition of TiO2 nanoparticles  For studying the electrical properties of this device  we decorated the primary PVA-TiO2 mat in perovskite solution and it was found that the perovskite crystallizes easily  The presence of perovskite in the TiO2 mat reveals the presence of significant crystallinity in perovskite with major diffraction peaks at 127°  218°  253°  295°  355°  38°  408°  431°  48°  539°  548°  584°  625°  75° can be attributed to

1 figure 1 XRD patterns of a PVA-TiO2 nanofiber and b perovskite decorated PVA-TiO2 nanofiber Full size image 32 Morphological analysis Figure 2a and b indicate the SEM images for the pristine PVA-TiO2 mat and perovskite decorated PVA-TiO2 mat  It can be observed that in the case of the pristine PVA-TiO2 mat  the structure of the nanofiber is uniform  regular with a smooth surface without any formation of beads and evenly distributed TiO2 nanoparticles over the nanofiber structure  The fibres are of few hundred nanometers in length with TiO2 particles embedded within them  The average diameter of the PVA-TiO2 nanofiber is presumably 150 nm  The presence of the TiO2 particles in the PVA nanofiber reduces the diameter of the fibre [ 9 ]  This contraction in the size of the fibre diameter boosts the active surface area which aids in the stability of the device  This characterization reveals the perfect formation of PVA-TiO2 composites nanofibers  However  in the case of perovskite decorated TiO2 mat  the perovskite particles are absorbed on the surface of the nanofibers  The decoration of perovskite on the bare TiO2 mat has a direct effect on the surface morphology and the size of the nanofiber  The surface of the fibre is completely covered with small perovskite crystal particles and there is a visible change in the structure of the nanofiber  It is evident from the pictures of the bare and perovskite coated TiO2 nanofibers that the morphology of the nanofibers changes completely when the TiO2 mat is coated with CH3NH3PbI3  Fig  2 figure 2 SEM image showing the morphology of a PVA-TiO2 mat and b perovskite decorated PVA-TiO2 mat Full size image 33 FT-IR spectra Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR ) is the most powerful method for identifying the types of chemical bonds ( functional groups ) present in compounds  The chemical bonds in a molecule can be determined by interpreting the infrared absorption spectrum  The chemical bonding of a perovskite decorated PVA-TiO2 mat was investigated through FTIR as shown in Fig  3  The FTIR spectra of the perovskite decorated nanofiber were recorded in the range of 4000–500 cm−1  It was identified that a relatively broad band was observed along the region between 3000 and 3200 cm−1 revealing the presence of free hydroxyl groups and bonded OH stretching vibrations of PVA  For the PVA-TiO2 nanofibers adsorbents  a new band of TiO2 peak having Ti–O bond appears between 600 and 670 cm−1  There is an extreme overlap of bands in the 500–1600 cm−1 which is due to the TiO2 nanoparticles incorporated in the matrix of the polymeric material  The perovskite peaks having C–H  N–H and C-N bond can be observed at 1460 cm−1  1675 cm−1 and at 1235 cm−1 which corresponds to the presence of perovskite in the nanofiber  Fig  3 figure 3 FTIR spectrum of the perovskite decorated TiO2 mat shows the presence of different chemical bonding Full size image 34 Current–voltage characteristics The electrical measurements of the perovskite decorated TiO2 mat was carried out by placing the dried mat in between two highly conducting ITO coated glass substrates  The ITO plates can be used as electrodes such that the conducting sides of the substrates are adjacent to the perovskite decorated TiO2 mat  The current–voltage ( I–V ) characteristics of the TiO2 mat and the perovskite decorated TiO2 mat have been shown in Fig  4  The bias starts from − 2 V to + 2 V and scanned back to − 2 V The consecutive I–V loops of the device are shown in Fig  S1  The I–V characteristics of the pristine PVA-TiO2 mat showed current in microampere range or less as shown in Fig  4 and Fig  S6  But in the case of perovskite decorated PVA-TiO2 mat  there is a rapid increase of current and the plot displays the presence of multiple Negative differential resistance ( NDR ) regions  Fig  4 figure 4 The I–V characteristics of both pristine PVA-TiO2 mat and perovskite decorated PVA-TiO2 mat  The inset box shows the enlarged region of multiple NDR Full size image In Fig  4  it was observed that when the voltage increases  the current decreased which endorses that the device is showing NDR  We can also notice that as voltage increases  the current alternately decreases and increases for more than once which is referred as multiple negative differential resistance  At these certain points  the differential resistance has negative values  But in case of the pristine PVA-TiO2 mat  it showed no NDR  The I–V characteristics of pristine PVA-TiO2 nanofiber are shown in Fig  S6  However  it shows some semiconducting properties when bias was applied  In Fig  4  the appearance of multiple NDR can be noticed in perovskite decorated PVA-TiO2 mat only for a scan range of − 2 V to + 2 V The inset of Fig  4  shows the enlarged region from − 1 V to + 1 V where the NDR region is clearly observed  The NDR starts from − 05 V to + 05 V At 0 V  there is a small valley formation resulting in the decrease and increase of current determining the NDR behaviour  The NDR signal  in this case  is produced by the quantum–mechanical hybridization between the left and right electrode states in the low-bias regime and its abrupt disruption in the high-bias regime [ 28  29 ]  However  this double hump like nature expands gradually and becomes prominent in the case of increasing the scanning voltage up-to 3 V This change in NDR behaviour is shown in Fig  S2c  At a minimum scan range of 2 V  the NDR behaviour is observed ; when the scanning range is increased to 3 V  the characteristics of NDR gradually rises and expands  Similarly  for other bias voltages like 15 V and 25 V the characteristic NDR behaviour changes as it depends on the voltage applied and is shown in Fig  S2a and Fig  S2b  However  in the case of pristine TiO2 mat  there is no increase in current when the voltage increases in the positive and negative bias region ( voltage starting from − 2 V to + 2 V )  But it shows some semiconducting behaviour  Thus  it was not possible to find an increase in current and so no negative differential resistance  Several I–V characteristics over a period of 25 days were recorded to study the stability of the device as shown in Fig  S7  Intermittently the device was preserved inside a dessicator and kept out of moisture exposure as much as possible  It would be seen that over period the electrical bistability shown by the device reduces but it maintains the NDR feature  In our previous work  the TiO2 nanofiber was decorated with poly [ 2-methoxy-5- ( 2-ethylhexyloxy ) -14-phenylenevinylene ] ( MEH-PPV ) [ 20 ]  That device showed a sharp decrease in current as a negative differential resistance as the scanning voltage passes 15 V A prominent NDR has been observed till the scan range of − 3 V to + 3 V as in the case of present perovskite decorated TiO2 nanofiber devices  However  the NDR behaviour vanished completely on increasing the voltage over 3 V [ 20 ]  But in the present case of perovskite decorated TiO2 mat  the NDR can be observed up-to 5 V The nanofiber is made up of a polymer layer where the TiO2 nanoparticles are incorporated between them  The energy band gap of this device is diminished by decorating the TiO2 nanofiber with perovskite which operate as the semiconducting layer  In general  methyl ammonium metal halide is chosen in most of the photovoltaic devices due to its ideal bandgap ( 13–29 eV )  The bandgap of the TiO2 was tuned by the addition of perovskite microcrystals  The energy bandgap of the polymer layer is very large and therefore the transmission of electrons does not take place  On incorporating the TiO2 nanoparticles between the polymer layer  leads to the decrease in the energy bandgap which further increases the conductivity and is represented as a schematic diagram in Fig  S5  However  with the addition of the perovskite microcrystals over the TiO2 layer  the conductivity is further increased  TiO2 has the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) situated at 72 eV and 40 eV which is larger than that of the perovskite active layer [ 30 ]  This satisfies the band alignment of the electron transport layer with the perovskite layer  The irregular stacking of atomic layers leads to the rise of defect sites in materials  The TiO2 nanoparticles act as the semiconducting layer consisting of many defect sites where these defect sites act as charge trapping sites  The charge carriers transiting through the TiO2 nanoparticles often tend to drop into these defect sites which has far different energetic configuration from the original nanofiber mat  Usually  the depth of these sites determines the lifetime of the charge carrier [ 20 ]  Generally  in higher voltage scan rates in semiconducting materials  the current increases gradually due to strong fields  However  in this case  it ’ s the inverse fact  This is due to the slower charge carriers tend to avoid the defect sites and reach the electrodes  whereas the faster charge carriers remain stable at these defect sites  This shows that the faster charge carriers meet the defect sites of TiO2 while transiting [ 27 ]  The voltage range up-to 15 V  the device shows only normal memory effect ie  single NDR peak  In this case  the memory effect or NDR behaviour is caused due to the defect sites in TiO2 nanoparticles  At a higher voltage scan rate of beyond 15 V  two NDR is observed in the low bias regime  Above 15 V  the charges start to tunnel between the layers and two humps like nature is observed  The NDR peaks vary depending on the bias applied  Multiple NDR behaviour is a very rare phenomenon  This phenomenon attributes to the difference in band positions of TiO2 and perovskite  It was observed that these multiple NDR behaviour was due to the tunnelling of charged particles from one layer to another  Some charged particles of the perovskite layer tunnel through the polymer giving rise to the first NDR peak whereas the charged particles of the TiO2 tunnel through the perovskite and the polymer layer giving rise to the second NDR peak  The presence of perovskite helps the tunnelling by lowering the barrier height of the polymer  It was interesting for us because only one NDR peak has been reported so far  In the case of tunnelling condition  it is similar to the quantum mechanical hybridization which is reported in this paper  This hybridization explains that the electron orbitals of individual atoms in separate molecules are triggered by applying external energetic stimulation like voltage  Therefore  the multiple peaks present in this study were attributed to be the result of quantum–mechanical hybridization taking place in the nanofiber when the voltage is applied [ 28  29 ]  This behaviour was interesting to us since this type of multiple NDR behaviour in TiO2 nanofiber was not reported so far  But due to quantum-hybridization mechanism  this could be possible [ 28 ]  The I–V characteristics of the nanofiber device showed both high- and low-conducting states when the voltage is applied across the terminals of the device  In the high-conducting state  when the voltage range increases  the current also gradually increases and hence there is very low resistance  But in the case of a low-conducting state  when the voltage increases  the current decreases due to negative differential resistance in the device  35 Write–read–erase–read Since the I–V characteristics of the perovskite decorated nanofiber device shows both high- and low-conducting states  we studied the “ write–read–erase–read ” sequence of this device as shown in Fig  5  Here  the voltage scan range of − 2 V and + 2 V were applied to ‘ write ’ the high-conducting state and then to ‘ erase ’ to a low-conducting state were observed  respectively  Figure 5 shows the current value corresponding to the applied voltage value depending upon the following ‘ write ’ or ‘ erase operation  Fig  5 figure 5 The switching performance of perovskite decorated TiO2 mat during a continuous “ write–read–erase–read ” sequence  The voltage pulse is shown in black colour and the current response is shown in red colour Full size image Also  it was observed that two different values of current were obtained for the same probe voltage  The difference in the current values for the same probe voltage of high- and low-conducting states permits it to be used in several applications like random-access memory ( RAM ) applications [ 1 ]  36 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS ) Generally  the electrical properties of the perovskite decorated TiO2 nanofiber results in two different current values for one probe voltage  The Nyquist plot indicates that charge confinement in the perovskite decorated TiO2 mat in the high-conducting state and the low-conducting state can be studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS ) as shown in Fig  6a  The charge transfer resistance is more for low-state shown in red colour and is less for high-state shown in black colour  When the voltage is supplied from − 2 V to + 2 V  the device switches to on state ie  high-conducting state due to very less charge transfer resistance  When the voltage bias of + 2 V to − 2 V is applied  the device switches to off state ie  the charge transfer resistance is very high so the device is low-conducting state  The variations of real ( Z′ ) and the imaginary ( Z″ ) parts of the impedance in the high- and low-conducting states are shown in Fig  6a  Firstly  to switch the device to a high-conducting state  very less dc voltage was applied and the impedance was measured immediately preceded by applying another applicable dc voltage to make the device work in the low-conducting state  Both the high- and low-conducting state plots take a semicircle path ; the diameter of the semicircle path for the high-conducting state decreases when compared to the low-conducting state due to switching  The conductivity increased linearly with increase in frequency  The conductivity was calculated from the formula  Zt/ ( Z′2 + Z″2 ) A where ‘ t ’ is the thickness of the film ( ~ 150 µm ) and ‘ A ’ is the cross sectional area of the device ( 1 × 1 cm2 )  The increase in conductivity with respect to the frequency in shown in Fig  6b  At 100 Hz the conductivity is equal to 55822 × 10–9 S/m  The recorded resistivity was equivalent to 017914 × 109 Ω-m  Fig  6 figure 6 Shows the a electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS ) of the device after the high-conducting state ( black line ) and after the low-conducting state ( red line ) b increase in conductivity with respect to frequency Full size image However  it is believed that the polarization due to a voltage applied above a threshold value ( 06 V ) results in the conductance changes making the device shift to a high-conducting state  Thus  to reinstate the device back to its low-conducting state  a suitable reverse bias is applied  4 Conclusion In conclusion  we have synthesized the TiO2 nanofiber by electrospinning method with a suitable polymer PVA and have decorated with methylammonium lead iodide  The fabricated sandwiched device ( ITO/perovskite decorated TiO2 nanofiber/ITO ) revealed the multiple NDR effect along with memory phenomenon  Due to this presence of NDR  it can find an application as a memory device where the NDR can act as a perfect triggering switch  Experimental studies proved that the bistability was due to the charge confinement of perovskite on the TiO2 mat  The electrochemical impedance study of the perovskite decorated nanofiber device reveals that the amount of charge stored in the high-conducting state is more than that of low-conducting state  The calculated impedance measurements revealed that the device showed increased capacitance and reduced resistance in the high-conducting states  For the same voltage bias  the device showed different current values which proved that it exhibited random-access memory behaviour  ReferencesAtomic-level passivation

conversion efficiency has made metal halide perovskite solar cells a real breakthrough in thin film photovoltaic technology in recent years  Here  we introduce a straightforward strategy to reduce the level of electronic defects present at the interface between the perovskite film and the hole transport layer by treating the perovskite surface with different types of ammonium salts  namely ethylammonium  imidazolium and guanidinium iodide  We use a triple cation perovskite formulation containing primarily formamidinium and small amounts of cesium and methylammonium  We find that this treatment boosts the power conversion efficiency from 205 % for the control to 223 %  221 %  and 210 % for the devices treated with ethylammonium  imidazolium and guanidinium iodide  respectively  Best performing devices showed a loss in efficiency of only 5 % under full sunlight intensity with maximum power tracking for 550 h We apply 2D- solid-state NMR to unravel the atomic-level mechanism

Introduction Metal halides perovskite are one of the most promising light harvesting materials among emerging photovoltaic technologies12345 solar to electric power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) reaching presently 237 % 6  Their ease of manufacturing together with low cost fabrication and high performance have made metal halide perovskites a true breakthrough in the thin film solar cell technology  However  solution deposition methods are prone to produce pinholes and defects whether at the grain boundaries or at the surface  which is considered one of the reasons behind a low device performance and stability78  One major obstacle to the development and commercialization of this technology continues to be the operational stability of the photovoltaic devices  Despite the vast progress that has been achieved on the synthesis of high quality multi-crystalline films  some complex problems have only been partially mitigated3  The often observed hysteretic behavior during J–V characterization  caused by ion mobility  can be considered a primary indication for the intrinsic long-term steady-state instability9  In that respect  the phase stabilization of specific perovskite formulations has been the object of thorough investigation21011  Recently  the reduction of defects at the surface and grain boundaries of the perovskite film as well as at the interfaces with the electrical contacts  has attracted great interest for its dramatic impact on the operational stability and efficiency of the device712  Mitigation of surface defects  whether at the interface of perovskite/HTL or perovskite/electron transport layer ( ETL )  provides the added benefit of improving the open-circuit voltage ( Voc ) without affecting the charge carrier transport or the fill factor ( FF )  Previous studies have employed several types of ammonium cations in order to impede the charge carrier recombination losses occurring at the interfaces or throughout the bulk of the perovskite film  Among those  formamidinium bromide ( FABr ) was used as an electron blocking layer  forming a wide band gap over layer ( FAPbBr3-xIx ) at the interface between the perovskite/HTL and consequently improving Voc by approximately 60 mV13  In a similar manner methylammonium iodide ( MAI ) was thermally evaporated at the interface perovskite/HTL  enhancing efficiency from 145 % to 172 % with a high reproducibility14  Lately  quaternary ammonium halides were found to decrease the ionic defects at the perovskite surface and significantly improve efficiency and stability7  Furthermore  phenylalkylamine molecules1516  and polymers17 have been used to improve the efficiency and moisture tolerance of perovskite solar cells ( PSC )  Moreover  guanidinium18192021  ethylammonium2223  and imidazolium2425 have been used as additive to improve different aspects of PSC operation  Herein we report a facile strategy to tailor the interface between the perovskite and the HTL ( Fig  1 )  We show that the modification of the perovskite surface via the addition of organic ammonium salts  namely  ethylammonium iodide ( [ ( C2H5 ) NH3 ] I  ( EAI ) )  imidazolium iodide ( [ C3N2H5 ] I  ( IAI ) )  and guanidinium iodide ( [ C ( NH2 ) 3 ] I  ( GuaI ) )  considerably increases the device performance  We use mixed-cation/halide perovskite formulations of the composition ( FA09Cs007MA003Pb ( I092Br008 ) 3 ) with 3 % excess of PbI2  These agents greatly reduce the hysteresis in the JV curve improving the solar to electric power conversion efficiency from 205 % for the control device to 223  221  and 210 % for the EAI-  IAI-  and GuaI-treated device  respectively  Moreover  defect mitigation improves the operational stability for the PSC ’ s  which was tested at full solar intensity under maximum power tracking condition for 550 h with a small loss of only 5 % for the best performing devices  Fig  1 figure 1 Scheme of our method for treating perovskite films by spin-coating of different organic ammonium salts ( EAI  IAI  and GuaI ) and consecutive annealing Full size image Results Characterization and fabrication of perovskite thin films We employed a device architecture comprising an FTO glass substrate  on top of which we deposited a compact TiO2 layer followed by mesoporous TiO2/perovskite/passivation layer/spiro-OMeTAD/gold  The complete procedure for the device fabrication is detailed in the method section  In short  the perovskite film was annealed at 150 °C for 30–40 min  After cooling down to room temperature  the passivation layer was immediately deposited by spin-coating a solution of ammonium salt ( EAI  IAI  and GuaI ) in isopropanol and subsequent annealing at 70 °C for 10–15 min  The concentration of the solution was optimized for each compound investigated ( Supplementary Table 1 ) and the different treatments were compared at their best condition  We note that the high annealing temperature could potentially drive off methylammonium from the thin film  Solid-state NMR quantification26 of the cation content of our films yielded 097 mol % FA and 003 mol % MA  which agrees with the stoichiometry of the precursor solution  indicating that MA is fully retained in the final perovskite composition even after the high annealing ( Supplementary Fig  1 and Supplementary Note 1 )  The surface treatment described above significantly modifies the perovskite composition and surface morphology due to a chemical reaction with the perovskite  This was traced by crystallographic structure analysis of the perovskite film using X-ray diffraction ( XRD )  Fig  2a and Supplementary Fig  2a  b  c  reveal the presence of unreacted PbI2 ( 2θ = 127° ) which is expected  since the precursor solution contains 3 % excess of PbI2  All three surface treatments have a similar effect on the XRD pattern  In particular  for concentrations above 3 mg/ml for all treatments  the PbI2 peaks completely disappear ( Fig  2a and Supplementary Fig  2a–c )  presumably via formation of a thin non-perovskite cover layer of EA/IA/Gua lead halide on top of the perovskite film  We have recently shown that solid-state magic angle spinning ( MAS ) NMR can be used to probe this kind of atomic-level microstructure of multi-component lead halide perovskites21262728  We therefore test the hypothesis by carrying out solid-state NMR measurements on a thin film of FA093Cs007PbI3 ( further referred to as CsFA ( I ) ) treated with EAI ( 5 mg ml−1 )  We used the pure-iodide CsFA ( I ) composition to avoid the overlap between MA and EA 1H signals and the formation of mixed iodide-bromide phases  which would complicate the interpretation  Figure 2b shows a 1H solid-state MAS NMR spectrum of the CsFA ( I ) thin film treated with 5 mg ml−1 EAI and identifies the presence of two organic cations in the film : FA ( 81 ppm ( CH ) and 73 ppm ( NH2+ ) ) as well as EA ( 63 ppm ( NH3+ )  36 ppm ( CH2 ) and 18 ( CH3 ) )  There is no unreacted EAI in the film ( Fig  2c )  which would give signals at 77  33  and 16 ppm with a full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) of 15–20 ppm due to strong 1H–1H dipole-dipole couplings  The EA signals in the the thin film have FWHM of 01–02 ppm  consistent with lower 1H density in the EA-containing phase29  The new EA species in the thin film have a spectral signature similar to that of EAPbI3 ( Fig  2d  64  38  and 20 ppm )  We thus confirm that EAI is fully converted into EA-containing lead halide phases during the passivation treatment  Fig  2 figure 2 Structural characterization

circles )  i schematic representation of the 1D/3D heterostructure evidenced by solid-state NMR proximity measurements Full size image That said  the EA signals are slightly shifted  indicating a small structural difference with respect to the pure 1D EAPbI3 phase29This can be potentially caused by the formation of mixed FA/EA  Cs/EA  and/or Cs/EA/FA phases  We demonstrate this by preparing α-FAPbI3 substitutionally doped with 10 mol % EAI ( FA09EA01PbI3 ) ( Fig  2e )  The spectrum of this material shows a distribution of environments for each of the EA sites ( CH3 : 06–23 ppm  CH2 : 30–43 and NH3+ : 53–67 ppm )  This distribution is likely caused by the formation of mixed FA/EA structures with a varying number of FA slabs separated by EA spacers  in structures similar to those reported for 2- ( 1H-pyrazol-1-yl ) pyridine-doped 1D/3D30 and butylammonium- and phenylethylammonium-based 2D/3D materials31  We further evidence the formation of mixed FA/EA phases by performing two-dimensional 1H–1H spin diffusion experiments  which correlate signals based on their spatial proximity ( up to around 10Å ) 32 ( Fig  2g )  The peaks lying on the diagonal correspond to the species presented in the 1D projection above  On the other hand  off-diagonal peaks indicate that two chemical environments are in atomic-level proximity ( an example is illustrated by the dashed orange line )  Beside trivial intramolecular contacts  every EA environment ( CH3  CH2 and NH2 ) is correlated to each of the two FA environments ( CH and NH2+ )  demonstrating unambiguously that EA and FA are microscopically mixed within the same phase  We then carried out the 1H–1H spin diffusion measurement on the EAI-treated CsFA ( I ) thin film and found through-space atomic-level contact between FA and EA ( Fig  2h  red circles )  confirming that the formation of mixed EA/FA phases is general  regardless of the processing conditions  We also show that analogous atomic-level proximities are present in the case of IAI and GuaI treatment  confirming the formation of 3D/1D heterostructures in these cases ( Supplementary Figs  7h–m and 8 )  While the exact spectral signature of EA in such mixed phases will depend on the FA/EA ratio and can conceivably be further modified by the presence of Cs  the chemical shift range and line widths corresponding to the model FA/EA phase matches that observed in the EAI-passivated thin film of CsFA ( I )  This finding is of paramount importance in that it shows that EAI is fully converted into new mixed EA/FA phases  Since the reaction is aided by IPA and as such happens without redissolution and recrystallization of the perovskite  the new EA/FA phase must form on the surface of the preexisting perovskite grains and its similarity from NMR to the 1D EAPbI3 suggests it is a 1D structure  We note that it is not possible to quantify the EA/FA ratio in the 1D passivation layer by simply comparing it to reference 1D FA1-xEAxPbI3 phases ( Supplementary Fig  7c–g )  as in the 3D/1D heterostructure the EA shift is additionally affected by the presence of the 3D perovskite phase in its immediate microscopic environment  This supports the formation of a firmly adhering passivation layer with high ambient stability  owing to the superior stability of 3D perovskites in hybrids with lower dimensionality structures ( Fig  2i ) 31 We also provide a comparison with a EA-treated film but without the second annealing step  which shows that the final 3D/1D heterostructure is formed during spin coating ( Supplementary Fig  7a–b )  Finally  we note that solid-state 1H MAS NMR quantification of the cation content in the passivated thin film revealed that the EA constitutes 10 mol % of the total organic cation content ( with 90 mol % FA )  After applying straightforward chemical and geometrical consideration  this corresponds to 27 nm thick 1D passivation layer ( Supplementary Note 2 )  Furthermore  surface morphology of the perovskite films was recorded via scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) ( Fig  3a–d )  In this study  the bulk perovskite composition was kept identical for all the conditions and only the surface was modified by the treatment with the 3 different agents  From Fig  3a–d and Supplementary Fig  3 we infer that the surface of the treated films shows much smaller grains than the control sample  To rule out etching of the perovskite surface by IPA as a cause of the roughening  we examined a control film  which was treated by neat IPA and ascertained that the solvent on its own does not modify the perovskite surface morphology ( Supplementary Fig  3 )  We then investigate surface roughness of the perovskite films after the surface treatment using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) ( Fig  3f–j )  It is apparent that the surface roughness  and thereby the corresponding specific surface area  has increased significantly for all the treated samples  with GuaI ( 5 mg ml−1 ) showing the highest root mean square ( RMS ) roughness of 127 nm  followed by EAI ( 3 mg ml−1 ) with 120 nm  IAI ( 7 mg ml−1 ) with 900 nm  and the control with 621 nm  Fig  3 figure 3 Morphological characterization of perovskite layers : a–d SEM top view images of the perovskite films with optimized treatment conditions  e AFM measurements ( x–y : 1 × 1 μm  z : 0 ± 90 nm ) reveal increasing RMS surface roughness for surface-treated perovskite absorbers : f control  g IAI  h EAI  and i GuaI Full size image Figure 4a and Supplementary Fig  4 show that the absorbance onset for control/IPA corresponded to that of EAI  IAI  and GuaI-passivated films indicating that the band gap of the bulk perovskite was not noticeably affected by the surface treatment  We investigated the steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence ( PL ) of the control and modified perovskite layer  Fig  4b and Supplementary Fig  1a–d show an increase in PL intensity in response to the post treatments  This suggests a reduction of the non-radiative recombination losses that could be explained by defect mitigation induced by cation exchange and filling of iodide vacancies at the absorber surface in agreement with previous work on methylammonium lead iodide films14  It is worth mentioning that the GuaI when applied at 7 mg ml−1 and 10 mg ml−1 showed a slight red shift as shown in Supplementary Fig  5  Fig  4 figure 4 Optical properties of perovskite films : a Absorbance  b steady-state photoluminescence  and c time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of treated and untreated perovskite films ; dashed lines present the fitting curves Full size image We carried out time-resolved photoluminescence ( TRPL ) on glass/Al2O3/perovskite samples with and without surface treatment  We excited the sample from the from the perovskite side using 670 nm wavelength light  By fitting the luminescence decays in Fig  4c according to our previously reported procedure27  we derived lifetimes τ1 = 1/k1 for the pseuo-first order trap mediated ( Shockley–Read-Hall ) non-radiative PL decay process  From TRPL data in Fig  4c  the decay lifetime increased with the application of our surface treatment from 250 ns for the control to 560 ns  625 ns  and 333 ns for EAI ( 3 mg ml−1 )  IAI ( 7 mg ml−1 )  and GuaI ( 5 mg ml−1 )  respectively  Photovoltaic device and performance We examined the effect of surface passivation by ammonium salts on the photovoltaic performance for complete devices in a FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au configuration ( for more details see Methods )  The data are shown in Fig  5a in comparison to a control device without passivation ( see Supplementary Table 1 for a comparison of all treatments with different concentrations )  Fig  5 figure 5 Photovoltaic characterization : a J-V curves of the devices with different passivation layers in comparison to the control device without any treatment  with a scan rate of 10 mV/s b Maximum power tracking of the same device  c ) IPCE spectra and calculated photocurrent integrated over the standard AM 15 G solar emission  In agreement to the J-V data no change in the spectra is observed  and d J–V metrics of perovskite devices with different treatment in comparison to the control Full size image The open-circuit voltages of all treated devices are significantly increased with an average improvement of 30 mV  70 mV  and 40 mV  for EAI  IAI  and GuaI  respectively ( see Fig  5d )  While the GuaI-treated devices showed an average reduction of the FF by 2 % absolute  the FF increased by 35 and 2 % for EAI and IAI-treated devices  respectively  reaching up to 81 % on the best performing EAI device without significant loss of the short circuit current ( Jsc )  The short circuit photocurrent densities are barely modified with a maximum average decrease of 04 mA cm−2 for the IAI-treated devices  Overall  the mean efficiency increased from 205 % for the control device to the 223 %  221 %  and 210 % for EAI  IAI  and GuaI-treated devices  respectively  with the champion device treated via EAI achieving up to 223 % PCE  Figure 5b further confirms stable power output for all treated devices during maximum power point tracking under one sun illumination for one minute  The incident photon-to-current efficiency ( IPCE ) and integrated current density as a function of wavelength are shown in Fig  5c  In agreement to UV-Vis  no shift in the onset of the IPCE spectra is detected for treated devices while integrated current densities agree well with the Jsc -values derived from the JV measurements  Moreover  Supplementary Fig  6a–d and Supplementary Table 2 show that the use of these ammonium salts as surface treatment is capable of reducing the hysteresis  To further analyze the effect of these buffer layers on the electrical properties  we performed intensity modulated voltage spectroscopy ( IMVS )  The data shown in Supplementary Fig  6e agree with the trend found for Voc  ie  the devices showing higher Voc show a longer electron lifetime at Voc  Operational stability of perovskite solar cells We also investigated is the operational stability of our PSCs under working conditions  This remains a major concern for PSC  which needs to be urgently addressed33  Best performing devices were subjected to full sunlight intensity with maximum power tracking for 550 h at room temperature in a nitrogen atmosphere  We note the good stability of the control device preserving 80 % of its initial PCE value  This is attributed to the perovskite composition employed in this work that has an extremely low content of MAI and contains a small addition of cesium iodide ( CsI ) to stabilize the predominately formamidinium lead iodide perovskite phase  From Fig  6a  the passivated devices show a different behavior  a small initial performance drop being followed by a stable power output  Remarkably for the EAI-treated device the overall loss in PCE is only 5 %  By contrast the control device shows a small but constant drop over the whole duration of the test  It is well-established that this behavior is due to the migration of ions from the HTM ( LiTFSI ) and gold from the gold electrode into the perovskite layer and to the TiO2 working electrode34  The fact that the efficiency loss for the passivated devices ceases after an initial decrease  it is reasonable to assume that that the passivating layer introduces a barrier at the HTM/perovskite interface that prevents the diffusion of HTM additives and gold diffusion into the perovskite layer  From cross-sectional SEM images ( Fig  6b–e ) we can see that before aging both control and modified devices appeared to have compact absorber layers  After 550 h or MPP testing  however  the appearance of voids at the interface between the mesoporous TiO2 and perovskite in the control and few voids also in the IAI- and GuaI-treated perovskites is visible  These voids  stemming from the degradation of the perovskite absorber  may affect the photon absorption and act as recombination centers to hinder charge carrier collection during operation of the solar cell  Confirming this trend  EAI showed good stability at MPP under constant illumination with a decrease of only 5 % and the absence of voids in the cross section SEM image of the aged devices shown in Fig  6c  Fig  6 figure 6 Stability data and cross section before and after aging for control and treated devices : a A comparison of operational stability of control and treated perovskite devices  The devices were measured

perovskite devices before and after aging at room temperature under constant illumination ( LED source  ~1 Sun ) for 550 h Images show perovskite absorber and covering HTL Full size image Discussion In summary  we investigated the effect of different ammonium salts ( ie  EAI  IAI  and GuaI ) as surface passivation agents on mixed-cation and mixed-halide perovskite films  Solid-state NMR has evidenced that they form a tightly adhering low-dimensionality passivation layer of on the preexisting perovskite grains  The introduction of these buffer layers showed a significant enhancement of the open-circuit voltage by 30 mV ( EAI )  70 mV ( IAI )  and 40 mV ( GuaI )  leading to the realization of PCEs as high as 223 %  221 %  and 210 % for EAI  IAI  and GuaI-treated devices  respectively  EAI and IAI showed an improvement also on the FF ( +35 % and +2 %  respectively ) with EAI reaching a FF of 81 % on the best performing device  In contrast to the control sample  all passivated devices  after an initial drop  stabilized their efficiency with the EAI-treated device only losing 5 % of its initial value after 550 h of MPP tracking  This work exemplifies the importance of interface engineering for perovskite solar cells and should stimulate other successful developments in the future  Methods Materials All materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received  unless stated otherwise  Solar cell preparation Fluorine-doped tin oxide ( FTO ) -glass substrates ( TCO glass  NSG 10  Nippon sheet glass  Japan ) were cleaned by ultrasonication in Hellmanex ( 2 %  deionized water )  rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and ethanol  and then treated in oxygen plasma for 15 min  Thirty nanometer blocking layer ( TiO2 ) was sprayed on the cleaned FTO by at 450 °C using a commercial titanium diisopropoxide bis ( acetylacetonate ) solution ( 75 % in 2-propanol  Sigma-Aldrich ) diluted in anhydrous ethanol ( 1:9 volume ratio )  A 150 nm mesoporous TiO2 layer ( diluted paste ( 1:6 wt  ratio ) ( Dyesol 30NRD : ethanol ) ) spin coated at 5000 rpm for 15 s  and then sintered at 450 °C for 30 min in dry air  Synthesis of perovskite films The perovskite films were deposited using a single-step deposition method from the precursor solution  which was prepared in Argon atmosphere and containing 135 M of FAI  FABr  MAI  CsI  PbI2 and PbBr2 in anhydrous dimethylformamide/ dimethylsulphoxide ( 4:1 ( volume ratio ) ) to achieve the desired composition : FA09Cs007MA003Pb ( I092Br008 ) 3 ( 3 % PbI2 excess )  The device fabrication  including the surface treatment step  was carried out inside a dry air box  under controlled atmospheric conditions with humidity < 2 % Perovskite solution was spin-coated in a two-step program at 1000 and 6000 rpm  respectively  Two hundred microliter of chlorobenzene was dropped on the spinning substrate  This was followed by annealing the films at 150 °C for 30–40 min  After preparing the initial perovskite layer ( control ) as described above  the film was cooled down at room temperature  Then  the surface treatment was performed by spin-coating a EAI  IAI  and GuaI-solution in isopropanol at different concentrations of 0 mg ml−1  3 mg ml−1  5 mg ml−1  7 mg ml−1  and 10 mg ml−1 at 6000 rpm for 30 s  followed by annealing at 70 °C for 10~15 min  For completing the fabrication of devices  85 mg of 22′77′-tetrakis ( N  N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine ) -99-spirobifluorene ( spiro-OMeTAD ) was dissolved in 1 ml of chlorobenzene as a hole-transporting material ( HTM )  The HTM was spin coated at 4000 rpm for 20 s The HTM was doped with bis ( trifluoromethylsulfonyl ) imide lithium salt ( 178 µl prepared by dissolving 520 mg LiTFSI in 1 ml of acetonitrile )  and 288 µl of 4-tert-butylpyridine  Finally  a ~80 nm gold ( Au ) layer was thermally evaporated  Device characterization The current-voltage ( J–V ) characteristics of the perovskite devices were recorded under ambient temperature and air conditions with a digital source meter ( Keithley model 2400  USA )  A 450 W xenon lamp ( Oriel  USA ) was used as the light source for photovoltaic ( J–V ) measurements  The spectral output of the lamp was filtered using a Schott K113 Tempax sunlight filter ( Präzisions Glas & Optik GmbH  Germany ) to reduce the mismatch between the simulated and actual solar spectrum to less than 2 %  The photo-active area of 016 cm2 was defined using a dark-colored metal mask  Incident photon-to-current efficiency ( IPCE ) It was recorded under a constant white light bias of approximately 5 mW cm−2 supplied by an array of white light emitting diodes  The excitation beam coming from a 300 W Xenon lamp ( ILC Technology ) was focused through a Gemini- 180 double

measurements ( Uv-Vis ) were performed on a Varian Cary 5  Photoluminescence spectra ( PL ) were obtained with a Florolog 322 ( Horiba Jobin Ybon Ltd ) in the wavelength range from 500 to 850 nm by exciting at 460 nm  Time-resolved photoluminescence ( TRPL ) was measured with a spectrometer ( FluoroLog-3  Horiba ) working in a time-correlated single-photon counting mode with less than ns time resolution  A picosecond pulsed diode laser head NanoLED N-670L ( Horiba ) emitting less than 200 ps duration pulses at 670 nm with a maximum repetition rate of 1 MHz was used as excitation source  The measurements were carried out under ambient conditions and no change in PL was observed during the course of the measurements ( several hours ) indicating no appreciable decomposition  Solid-state

solid adamantane ( δ = 191 ppm )  Quantitative 1H spectra were acquire with a recycle delay of 150 s The CsFA and CsMAFA samples were prepared as thin films on glass slides using the same deposition technique as for PSC fabrication and scratched off the slides into a rotor  EAPbI3 and FA09EA010PbI3 were prepared using mechanosynthesis  according to previously published procedures2126353637  1H–1H

electrode material compared to conventional Al and Ag electrodes  The photo-stability of such devices has not been explored much in the literature  therefore we present here the investigation carried out towards the photo-stability of PSCs based on top Cu electrodes  The PSCs were prepared in normal geometry and stored in dark  under continuous illumination of a white LED lamp inside the laboratory and under direct sunlight outside the laboratory and tested as per the international summit on organic photovoltaics stability protocols  In dark storage the encapsulated solar cells exhibited highest stability but under illumination they exhibited degradation in their performance and the degradation was fastest in the direct sunlight  Degradation under illumination has been attributed to the photo-oxidation of the perovskite film  Cu has been observed to diffuse into and react with the underlying perovskite film and the ultraviolet and infrared contents in direct sunlight accelerated the photo-oxidation and chemical reactions between Cu and perovskite film  The chemical reactions of Cu electrode with perovskite constituents made it disappear after some time  These investigations suggest that Cu too is not a very stable electrode material for PSCs under natural operating conditions  Similar content being viewed by others Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells :

2020–2021 Article Open access 07 July 2021 1 Introduction Organo-metal halide perovskite semiconductors have shown enormous potential for efficient and cost effective conversion of solar energy into electricity and have now become the materials of high importance for energy conversion [ 1 ]  These materials have extraordinary electrical and optical properties and the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) has gone beyond 23 % [ 2 ]  approaching to that of the conventional Si solar cells  Integration of PSCs with Si solar cells in tandem structures has shown PCE over 26 % [ 345 ] and it is expected that the PCE of such devices can easily go beyond 30 % [ 6 ]  But before this technology is considered for real market products  its scalable fabrication and long term stability are the major issues that need to be sorted out  Usually PSCs are prepared via spin coating technique but some efforts have also been made to prepare perovskite films via well established scalable solution deposition techniques like spray coating [ 7 ]  doctor blade coating [ 8 ]  slot die coating [ 9 ] and screen printing [ 10 ]  Since PSCs incorporate the layers of multiple materials like light absorber  charge transport materials and electrodes  the process for large scale production of complete optimized structure is yet to be realized  Performance of PSCs is very sensitive to materials purities  processing conditions and growth methods  A little variation in these parameters leads to a very large variation in the device performance  so the performance is optimized very carefully  PSCs have shown to degrade and lose their photovoltaic properties at high temperatures and when exposed to oxygen  moisture and UV light [ 11121314 ]  It is observed that the water molecules hydrolyse the perovskites and break them into their precursors  For example  in the presence of H2O molecules methyl ammonium lead iodide ( CH3NH3PbI3 ) breaks down into CH3NH3I ( MAI ) and lead iodide ( PbI2 )  while MAI further breaks down into CH3NH2 and HI [ 15  16 ]  The decomposition of perovskites gets accelerated at high temperatures and in the presence of UV light [ 17 ]  Though the molecular decomposition can be overcome to some extent via molecular engineering [ 181920 ]  compositional engineering [ 21  22 ] or using the cross linking additives in the precursors [ 23 ]  but it is not only the perovskite materials that exhibit degradation  the charge transport layers  electrode materials and their interfaces with perovskite films also exhibit deterioration  which affect the overall performance of the devices  Chemical reaction between perovskite and the electrode materials is the dominating degradation mechanism in PSCs  Aluminum ( Al ) and silver ( Ag ) are the most frequently used metals as electrodes in PSCs and both have shown strong chemical reactions with perovskites [ 242526 ]  Introduction of metal oxide buffer layers or fullerenes between perovskite and metal electrodes has been observed to reduce the interfacial breakdown and degradation in PSCs [ 272829 ]  But the actual solution of this problem would be to have an electrode material  which has high chemical resistivity against the perovskites  Though gold ( Au ) is less reactive compared to Al and Ag but it is too expensive to be used for large scale production  There are also some reports in the literature where copper ( Cu ) has been used as the top electrode [ 8  30 ]  Cu has high corrosion resistance for non-oxidizing acids like HCl  HI  HBr and halogens [ 31 ]  Huang et al  replaced the top Al electrode by Cu in CH3NH3PbI3 based PSCs in the inverted structure where solar cells were prepared on indium tin oxide ( ITO ) coated glass substrates in the ITO/poly [ bis ( 4-phenyl ) ( 246-trimethylphenyl ) amine ] ( PTAA ) /perovskite/indene-C60 bisadduct ( ICBA ) /C60/29-dimethyl-47-diphenyl-110-phenanthroline ( BCP ) /metal cathode structure and studied for their air stability [ 8 ]  Interestingly  where the PCE of Al based solar cells dropped to zero just in 2 days  the solar cells based on Cu electrode showed almost zero loss for up to 30 days  These results clearly showed that Cu is less reactive to perovskite than Al  Less chemical reactivity of Cu with perovskite was also supported by X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopic ( SEM ) studies [ 8 ]  It is worth noting that insertion of an electron transport layers between perovskite and Cu electrode would suppress the chemical reactions between them  In subsequent studies Huang et al  observed no chemical reaction between Cu and CH3NH3PbI3 in encapsulated devices and predicted that at nominal operating cell temperature ( NOCT ) of 40 °C  the devices could be stable up to 22 years [ 30 ]  They observed no diffusion of Cu into perovskite for over 100 h at 80 °C  The solar cells retained 98 % of their initial efficiency even after 816 h in ambient air without encapsulation  These studies show that Cu is a very stable electrode material for PSCs when devices are stored in ambient environment in dark  but not much detail is available on their photo-stability or stability under actual operating conditions  It would be very important to explore more about the suitability of Cu electrode for high stability in PSCs with different perovskite materials and charge transport layers  We have investigated and report here the photo-stability of PSCs based on Cu electrode in indoor as well as actual outdoor conditions  The solar cells were not prepared in inverted structure like by Huang et al  [ 8  30 ] but in the normal geometry on fluorine doped tin oxide ( FTO ) coated glass substrates with different charge transport materials  For detailed understanding of degradation mechanisms the solar cells were stored in different illumination conditions  Some of the solar cells were stored in dark  some were stored under continuous illumination of a white LED lamp and some were stored outside the laboratory under natural sunlight  The performance of devices was tested time to time as per the international summit on organic photovoltaic stability ( ISOS ) protocols [ 32 ]  Though the solar cells exhibited very high stability in dark storage but under illumination they indeed degraded and the degradation was very fast in actual outdoor conditions  2 Experimental 21 Materials Present investigation involved the use of FTO coated glass substrates  titanium iso-propoxide  titania paste ( Dyesol 18NR-T )  methyl ammonium iodide ( MAI )  lead iodide ( PbI2  99 % )  phenyl C60 butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM )  regioregular poly ( 3-hexylthiophene ) ( P3HT )  Cu metal ( 9999 % )  ethanol  anhydrous dimethyl formamide ( DMF )  anhydrous chloroform  acetone and isopropyl alcohol  Acetone  isopropyl alcohol and ethanol were purchased from MERCK Chemicals  Germany and MAI was purchased from Lumtech Chemicals  Taiwan  Other materials like FTO coated glass substrates  titanium iso-propoxide  titania paste  PbI2  PCBM  P3HT  Cu metal  anhydrous DMF and anhydrous chloroform were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Chemicals  USA  All the materials were used as received from their sources  22 Growth of perovskite films and characterization Prior to solar cell fabrication  some of the thin films of perovskite material were subjected to the studies of their light absorption spectrum  crystal structure and surface morphology using UV–Vis absorption spectrometer ( Shimadzu UV-2401 PC )  X-ray diffractometer ( XRD ) ( Cu Kα radiation  154 Å ) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope ( FE-SEM ) ( ZEISS  USA ) respectively  The perovskite films were grown via spin coating of its precursor on the TiO2 coated FTO substrates  It is worth mentioning here that the basic properties and growth of the perovskite crystals depend very strongly on the surface energy of the underlying films and the substrates [ 24 ]  Therefore to avoid any possible change  which might happen in morphology and other properties of the perovskite films due to variation in the surface energy of the underlying film  all the perovskite films were grown on TiO2-bl and TiO2-mp coated FTO substrates only  Here TiO2-bl represents the compact hole blocking  electron transport layer ( ETL ) of TiO2 and TiO2-mp represents the mesoporous ETL of TiO2 nano-particles  This assured that the properties of the perovskite films in the solar cells were exactly the same as studied here  Prior to any deposition  the FTO substrates were properly cleaned via standard cleaning method  For compact TiO2-bl films  mild acidic solution of titanium isopropoxide in ethanol was spin coated over FTO substrates at 2000 rpm for 60 s and cured at 300 °C for 5 min  Subsequently a dilute solution ( 80 mg/ml ) of TiO2 nano-particle paste ( Dyesol 18NR-T ) was spin coated at 2000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 550 °C for 1 h in a muffle furnace  Both the TiO2-bl and TiO2-mp films were prepared in ambient environment  After cooling down to room temperature the samples were transferred to a glove box filled with high purity dry nitrogen ( O2 < 1 ppm  H2O < 1 ppm )  where perovskite films were grown via two steps method  First of all 400 mg/ml solutions of PbI2 with 001 wt % of PCBM  dissolved in DMF  was spin coated over TiO2-mp films at 6000 rpm for 60 s and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min  that yielded a pale yellow film of PbI2  Since a minute amount of PCBM has been observed to improve the grain size of the perovskite crystals in thin films which in turn leads to enhanced short circuit current density ( Jsc ) and fill factor ( FF ) in solar cells [ 33  34 ]  we added 001 wt % of PCBM in PbI2  After cooling down to room temperature 50 mg/ml solution of MAI in isopropyl alcohol was spin coated over PbI2 films at 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 100 °C for 30 min that resulted in conversion of the pale yellow films into dark brown films which was the indication of formation of perovskite crystals  The preparation of perovskite films is schematically shown in Fig  1a  Finally these samples were used for the basic characterization of perovskite films via UV–Vis absorption  XRD and FE-SEM analysis  Fig  1 figure 1 a Schematic representation of the growth of perovskite films  b Schematic structure of the PSCs under study and a photograph of one of the solar cells Full size image 23 Solar cell fabrication The solar cells were prepared on FTO coated glass substrates in the configuration FTO/TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp/Perovskite/P3HT/Cu  FTO coated substrates were patterned and cleaned via standard cleaning procedure  In brief the substrates were sequentially cleaned with soap solution  distilled water  acetone and isopropyl alcohol  After cleaning the substrates were dried using high pressure dry nitrogen  Prior to any deposition the FTO substrates were treated with air plasma for 15 min in a vacuum chamber  The substrates were coated with TiO2-bl and TiO2-mp thin films in ambient air following the procedure given in previous section  For the growth of perovskite films the samples were transferred to the glove box  where perovskite films were prepared following the method mentioned in previous section  For hole transport layer ( HTL ) 15 mg/ml solution of P3HT in anhydrous chloroform was spin coated at 4000 rpm for 60 s on the perovskite films  For the deposition of top Cu electrodes and to complete the solar cells  the samples were transferred to a vacuum chamber where 100 nm of Cu electrode was thermally evaporated onto the samples through a shadow mask at the base pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar  The schematic structure and photograph of one of the solar cells is shown in Fig  1b  It is worth mentioning here that in most efficient PSCs the HTL is usually a thin layer of Spiro-MeOTAD doped with tert-butylpyridine ( TBP ) and Lithium bis ( trifluoromethanesulfonyl ) imide ( Li-TFSI ) [ 35 ]  but the hygroscopic nature of Li-TFSI leads to rapid degradation in cell performance in the moist environment [ 36 ]  Therefore the application of a more robust and stable HTL would result in better stability in PSCs  P3HT is an important HTL material which has shown very high stability in roll to roll polymer solar cells [ 37 ]  Keeping the stability of P3HT in our mind we used it as HTL in place of Spiro-MeOTAD  Since the hole mobility in P3HT is not as high as that in the doped Spiro-MeOTAD [ 38 ]  the PCE of our solar cells was not as high as expected with doped Spiro-MeOTAD  24 Solar cells characterization and storage For determination of photovoltaic parameters  the solar cells were exposed to 100 mW/cm2 illumination of an AM15G class AAA solar simulator from Photo Emission Tech ( PET )  USA and tested for their current density–voltage ( J–V ) characteristics under illumination using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter unit interfaced with a computer  The photovoltaic parameters were extracted out from the illuminated J–V characteristics that led us to calculate the PCE  The initial testing of solar cells was carried out in the air in ambient conditions and the devices were in air for quite some time  After initial measurements the cells were encapsulated in the glove box using glass cover slips and a UV curable epoxy from Epo-Tek  USA  Now for the understanding of degradation mechanisms  some of the solar cells were stored in dark  some were stored under continuous illumination of a white LED lamp at an irradiance of 10 mW/cm2 and some were stored under natural sunlight outside the laboratory and their degradation studies were carried out as per the ISOS-D-1  ISOS-L-1 and ISOS-O-1 protocols respectively [ 32 ]  In brief  as per the ISOS-D-1 protocol the solar cells are stored in a dark chamber inside the laboratory with ambient conditions and tested periodically for their photovoltaic performance under solar simulator or natural sunlight  After testing the cells are stored back in the dark chamber  This procedure gives shelf life of the devices  As per ISOS-L-1 protocol the solar cells are stored under continuous illumination of a light source with constant illumination intensity inside the laboratory and tested periodically for their photovoltaic performance under solar simulator  This procedure gives the life time of devices under continuous indoor diffused light  As per ISOS-O-1 protocol the solar cells are stored in actual outdoor conditions under natural sunlight and tested periodically for their photovoltaic performance under solar simulator or natural sunlight  This procedure gives the actual lifetime of the devices in actual operating conditions  3 Results and discussion Figure 2a shows the X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) graph of CH3NH3PbI3 : PCBM film on TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp coated FTO glass substrate along with the XRD graphs of PbI2 : PCBM film on TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp coated FTO substrate and TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp coated FTO substrate only  The XRD pattern of FTO/TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp sample exhibited the diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 266°  339°  379°  516°  617° and 657° whereas the FTO/TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp/PbI2 : PCBM sample exhibited the diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 128°  266°  339°  379°  516°  617° and 657°  The diffraction peak at 128° corresponds to ( 001 ) plane of hexagonal structure of PbI2 and the other peaks correspond to the base substrate having TiO2 and FTO  In case of FTO/TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp/CH3NH3PbI3 : PCBM sample the diffraction peaks occurred at 2θ values of 142°  246°  266°  286°  321°  339°  379°  407°  432°  516°  617° and 657°  The peaks at 142°  246°  286°  321°  407°  and 432° correspond to the ( 110 )  ( 202 )  ( 220 )  ( 310 )  ( 224 ) and ( 314 ) planes of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite whereas the other peaks correspond to base substrate having TiO2 and FTO  The existence of ( 110 )  ( 202 )  ( 220 )  ( 310 )  ( 224 ) and ( 314 ) planes indicate the formation of highly crystalline tetragonal phase of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite  It is observed that addition of PCBM in PbI2 has no effect on the crystal structure and diffraction peaks of the perovskite [ 33  39 ]  Chiang et al  observed that pure and PCBM doped perovskite films have similar crystalline domain size but higher crystallinity in PCBM doped film [ 39 ]  PCBM does not react with any of the perovskite constituents or occupy any of the sites in the crystal lattice and does not affect the crystal structure but it interacts with perovskite precursor and helps in growth of perovskite crystals during thermal annealing  It plays an important role in crystal nucleation and increases the range of crystal growth leading to larger crystal gains [ 39 ]  Figure 2b shows the UV–Vis absorption spectra of PbI2 : PCBM and CH3NH3PbI3 : PCBM films on FTO/TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp substrates  The dotted lines at the absorption edge have been plotted to extrapolate the low energy linear part of the absorption graphs to zero absorption to calculate the corresponding band gaps as per the Tauc relation  In this way the band gaps of the two materials were found to be 23 eV for PbI2 and 158 eV for the CH3NH3PbI3  Inset of Fig  2b shows schematically the tetragonal structure of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite  Fig  2 figure 2 a XRD patterns of ( i ) FTO/TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp ( ii ) FTO/TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp/PbI2 : PCBM and ( iii ) FTO/TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp/CH3NH3PbI3 : PCBM structures  b UV–Vis absorption spectra of PbI2 : PCBM and CH3NH3PbI3 : PCBM thin films  The inset shows schematically the tetragonal crystal structure of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite Full size image Figure 3 shows the scanning electron microscopic ( SEM ) images of the PbI2 : PCBM and CH3NH3PbI3 : PCBM films grown on the FTO/TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp substrates  Formation of PbI2 crystals with some minute pin holes can be seen very clearly from the SEM image  The film was very uniform with high substrate coverage  When MAI was coated on PbI2 film to form the perovskite  the pin holes were filled giving a very compact and uniform film of the perovskite with almost 100 % substrate coverage  Higher substrate coverage results in reduced leakage current which in turn leads to higher open circuit voltage ( Voc ) and FF [ 40  41 ]  Low substrate coverage would cause HTL to be in contact with ETL that would result in enhanced recombination of photo-generated electrons with photo-generated holes  Enhanced recombination is reflected in poor shunt resistance of the devices  Additionally the uncovered area would cause incident photons to pass through without getting absorbed and contributing to photo-current  As a whole the low substrate coverage results in poor photovoltaic performance of the solar cells  Figure 4 shows the J–V characteristics of one of the perovskite solar cells  The characteristics were measured via scanning the voltage between − 02 and 11 V with step of 12 mV and measuring the corresponding current in both the forward and reverse sweeps  Inset shows the photovoltaic parameters of the solar cell calculated from forward and reverse sweep characteristics  The characteristics exhibited negligible hysteresis  The PCE of these devices has been observed to be lower than those incorporating Spiro-MeOTAD as HTL  Though the Voc of these devices was very high ~ 1 V  the lower PCE was mainly because of lower Jsc and FF  Lower Jsc and FF in these devices can be clearly attributed to lower hole mobility through P3HT compared to Spiro-MeOTAD [ 38 ]  It is a well known fact that the HTL with lower hole mobility will introduce additional series resistance in the devices for collection of holes  that would cause enhanced recombination of charge carriers and reduced Jsc and FF [ 32 ]  Fig  3 figure 3 SEM images of a PbI2 : PCBM and b CH3NH3PbI3 : PCBM thin films on the TiO2-bl and TiO2-mp coated FTO substrates Full size image Fig  4 figure 4 J–V characteristics of one of the solar cells in forward and reverse sweeps  Inset shows that corresponding photovoltaic parameters Full size image Figure 5 shows the degradation profiles in the photovoltaic parameters of the solar cells tested as per the ISOS-D-1  ISOS-L-1 and ISOS-O-1 protocols  The devices were tested up to around 800 h The values of the parameters were normalized with respect to the corresponding average value for three devices  In the dark storage and testing as per the ISOS-D-1 protocols  the temperature and relative humidity of the surrounding environment were 24 ± 4 °C and 45 ± 5 % respectively  The solar cells were tested time to time for their photovoltaic performance and placed back in the dark after every measurement  The storage in dark environment had no significant effect on the performance of solar cells  However the PCE improved slightly in the initial hours and that was mainly because of slight improvement in Jsc  This improvement in Jsc can be attributed to reduced charge traps  reorganization of interlayer interfaces and healing effects with time in the perovskite films [ 42 ]  Reduction in charge traps would cause reduction in recombination losses and enhancement in the output current  Zhou et al  reported a reversible healing effect on the perovskite films via water molecules [ 42 ]  Though the sealed devices stored in dark are expected to be highly stable with no change in their photovoltaic performance but it is worth mentioning here that before encapsulation the devices were in air for quite some time for initial measurements  This resulted in exposure of the solar cells to ambient O2 and H2O molecules  Adsorption of O2 and H2O molecules during initial hours would have contributed to healing of the perovskite film and the effect of which was observed in the subsequent measurements  The encapsulation ensured no further diffusion of O2 and H2O molecules into the devices and contributed to reduction in subsequent degradation rate  We did not observe any change in Voc of the cells but the FF reduced slightly  It is worth mentioning here that in the metal-insulator-metal ( MIM ) structures the difference in the work-function of the electrodes determines the built-in potential in the devices and built-in potential plays an important role in controlling the Voc [ 43 ]  No deterioration in the Voc of the cells suggests no deterioration in Cu electrode and no chemical reaction with perovskite film  However the reduction in FF can be attributed to interlayer interfacial changes  Please note that encapsulation inhibits the diffusion of external entities like O2 and H2O into the devices ( depending upon the quality of barrier film and the encapsulating glue ) but it does not prevent the internal inter-diffusion of constituent materials and interlayer interfacial changes that will affect the device performance  We also took photographs of the cells time to time from a digital camera and did not observe any visual defects or changes in the devices  Figure 6 shows photographs of some of the solar cells stored under different conditions  The photographs were taken at different time intervals but only the photographs for initial and final measurements are shown  High stability in dark storage is in agreement with the observations of Huang et al  [ 8  30 ]  Fig  5 figure 5 Degradation profiles of normalized Jsc  Voc  FF and PCE of the solar cells stored in different conditions and tested as per the ISOS-D-1  ISOS-L-1 and ISOS-O-1 protocols Full size image Fig  6 figure 6 Photos of some of the solar cells stored in a dark  b white LED lamp illumination and c outdoor conditions  The photos were taken time to time during investigation but only the photos of initial and final measurements are shown here Full size image In case of storage under continuous illumination of a white LED lamp and testing as per the ISOS-L-1 protocols  the illumination intensity of the lamp was 10 mW/cm2 and the temperature and humidity of the surrounding environment were 24 ± 4 °C and 45 ± 5 % respectively  The solar cells were tested time to time for their photovoltaic performance and placed back under continuous illumination after every measurement  Continuous illumination from LED lamp caused little degradation in PCE of the cells with time and this degradation was mainly because of degradation in Jsc and FF  The Voc exhibited no degradation with time and suggests no deterioration in electrode materials  We did not observe any visual defects or changes in the devices under continuous illumination of LED lamp ( Fig  6b )  The illumination intensity of the lamp was 10 mW/cm2 only  The degradation in performance was mainly because of internal degradation in the device constituents  mainly the active layer  The reduction in Jsc and FF can be attributed to photo-degradation of the perovskite films  It is worth mentioning here that the organo-metal halide perovskite semiconductors exhibit photo-degradation  though the rate of degradation would depend upon the intensity and severity of the incident light [ 24 ]  Photo-degradation causes the perovskite films to decompose into its constituents and lose their optical and electrical properties  Loss in optical and electrical properties of perovskite would cause deterioration in Jsc and FF of the solar cells  These results suggested Cu electrode to be very stable even under mild illumination of a white LED lamp  In case of sample storage under natural sunlight outside the laboratory and testing as per the ISOS-O-1 protocols  we observed very rapid and severe degradation in Voc and FF  Though Jsc exhibited little improvement in initial few hours but after around 120 h it decreased very quickly and became zero  The reduction in Voc and FF overcame the increment in Jsc and the overall PCE decreased with time  It is important to note that the degradation mechanisms of solar cells under natural sunlight were completely different from those under LED lamp illumination and the reason behind that was more harsh environmental conditions outside the laboratory  The outdoor illumination intensity was more than that of LED lamp and the solar radiation exhibited high ultraviolet ( UV ) and infrared ( IR ) radiations compared to that of LED lamp  The spectra of solar radiation and LED lamp are compared in Fig  7  During day time the environmental temperature varied from 25 to 42 °C and the humidity varied from 32 to 48 %  The temperature and humidity were measured using the temperature and humidity sensors  During night the temperature went down to 16 °C and the humidity went up to 62 %  The illumination intensity outside the laboratory was measured using a solar power meter from TENMARS  Taiwan and it varied from 0 in the night to ~ 95 mW/cm2 at the noon  Since the devices were encapsulated using the glass cover slips the effect of humidity variation during testing is expected to be negligible but high temperature and high illumination intensity would contribute to rapid degradation in solar cell performance  The measurements of photovoltaic parameters were carried out during day time inside the laboratory  After each measurement the solar cells were placed back in the natural conditions outside the laboratory  The improvement in Jsc in initial hours was fluctuating and can be attributed to the recovery in the perovskite film during night [ 44 ]  During day time under continuous illumination of the solar light  Jsc decreased but during night it recovered  We did not see any improvement in Jsc for the studies as per ISOS-L-1 protocols and the reason behind that was continuous illumination of LED lamp for all the time  But more importantly the Voc and FF exhibited very severe degradation and the reason behind that was reaction of Cu electrode with underlying materials  We could visually see the defects and changes happening in the solar cells  The top Cu electrode reacted with underlying materials and disappeared after some time ( Fig  6c )  These results were very surprising as Cu was expected to be very stable material for PSCs [ 30 ]  but it reacted with perovskite film and led to very rapid degradation in cell performance under natural operating conditions  Fig  7 figure 7 Comparison of the solar spectrum corresponding to AM15G solar irradiance outside the laboratory with the spectrum of white LED lamp used in the present studies  The solar spectrum possessed UV and IR contents which were absent in the LED lamp illumination Full size image To understand the chemical reactions taking place in the solar cells we prepared four separate samples in the following configurations ; ( i  ) Sample 1 : FTO/TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp/CH3NH3PbI3 : PCBM/P3HT  ( ii  ) Sample 2 : FTO/TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp/CH3NH3PbI3 : PCBM/P3HT/Cu  ( iii  ) Sample 3 : FTO/TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp/CH3NH3PbI3 : PCBM/P3HT/Cu  ( iv  ) Sample 4 : FTO/TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp/CH3NH3PbI3 : PCBM/P3HT/Cu  All the samples were prepared in identical conditions and Sample 2  3 and 4 were exactly the same  The only difference in Sample 1 was that it did not have top Cu electrode  Sample 1 and 2 were stored in a dark chamber whereas Sample 3 and 4 were stored in natural conditions under direct sunlight outside the laboratory  None of these samples were encapsulated  After around 150 h of storage the top Cu electrode of Sample 4 was peeled off carefully using a cello tape  The cello tape was stick on the top of the sample and peeled off in such a way that only top Cu electrode came off with the tape not any other layer  Now all the four samples were subjected to XRD analysis to understand the chemical changes happened in them  Figure 8 shows the XRD patterns of all the four samples  The XRD peaks corresponding to different materials have been represented by different symbols shown in the inset of the figure  Sample 1 exhibited the XRD peaks at 2θ values of 142°  246°  266°  286°  321°  339°  379°  407°  432°  516°  547°  617° and 657°  The peaks at 266°  339°  379°  516°  547°  617° and 657° corresponded to FTO/TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp structure and the other peaks at 142°  246°  286°  321°  407° and 432° corresponded to ( 110 )  ( 202 )  ( 220 )  ( 310 )  ( 224 ) and ( 314 ) planes of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite  Since P3HT is an amorphous polymer and other materials are highly crystalline  the XRD features of P3HT were not visible in the XRD pattern  In case of Sample 2 we observed three additional peaks at 2θ values of 436°  508° and 744° which corresponded to ( 111 )  ( 200 ) and ( 220 ) planes of the top Cu electrode  These results show that even after around 150 h of dark storage  there were no chemical reactions happened in the samples and they were just like fresh samples  It can be inferenced from these results that Cu is very stable and reacts extremely slow with perovskite film in the dark storage  But in case of Sample 3  after around 150 h of storage in natural outdoor conditions the XRD peaks at 142°  246°  286°  321°  407° and 432°  which were present in Sample 2  disappeared and new XRD peaks at 257°  301°  327° and 425° appeared  Disappearance of peaks at 142°  246°  286°  321°  407° and 432° clearly indicated that perovskite had decomposed and some chemical reactions had taken place in Samples 3 that resulted in variation in its XRD pattern  More information about these chemical reactions was gathered from the XRD pattern of Sample 4  which was also stored in the same outdoor conditions along with Sample 3 but its top Cu electrode had been peeled off before XRD measurements  In case of Sample 4 we observed the XRD peaks at 2θ values of 257°  266°  301°  327°  339°  379°  425°  436°  516°  547°  617° and 657°  The peaks at 266°  339°  379°  516°  547°  617° and 657° correspond to the FTO/TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp structure  The peaks at 257°  301°  327° and 425° were also present in Sample 3  A very little peak at 436° in Sample 4 corresponds to ( 111 ) plane of Cu  Though we had peeled off the top Cu electrode  yet the existence of XRD peak at 436° in Sample 4 indicates that Cu had diffused into the layers underneath  Now we noticed that the peaks at 257°  301°  and 425° were representing ( 111 )  ( 200 ) and ( 220 ) planes of CuI  These are very interesting results and indicate that under natural outdoor conditions Cu diffuses into the layers underneath and reacts with perovskite film to form CuI  As discussed previously the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite is expected to decompose into CH3NH3I and PbI2 where CH3NH3I decomposed further into CH3NH2 and HI [ 15  16 ]  But we did not see any feature of PbI2 in the XRD patterns of Sample 3 and 4 which indicated that PbI2 also decomposed in outdoor conditions  Detailed analysis showed that the peak at 327° in Sample 3 and 4 corresponded to ( 110 ) plane of PbO  which means that due to very harsh environmental conditions outside  PbI2 converted into PbO  From these investigations we can inference that under direct sunlight in natural outdoor conditions following chemical reactions take place in the Cu electrode based PSCs ; ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) Fig  8 figure 8 XRD patterns of FTO/TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp/CH3NH3PbI3 : PCBM/P3HT ( Sample 1 )  FTO/TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp/CH3NH3PbI3 : PCBM/P3HT/Cu ( Sample 2 )  FTO/TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp/CH3NH3PbI3 : PCBM/P3HT/Cu ( Sample 3 ) and FTO/TiO2-bl/TiO2-mp/CH3NH3PbI3 : PCBM/P3HT/Cu ( Sample 4 ) after 150 h of storage  Sample 1 and 2 were stored in a dark chamber whereas Sample 3 and 4 were stored in natural conditions under direct sunlight outside the laboratory  Please note that before XRD measurements the top Cu electrode of Sample 4 had been peeled off using a cello tape Full size image The disappearance of top Cu electrode in the samples stored under direct sunlight was because of its reaction with perovskite and conversion into CuI  In the storage under direct sunlight  we also observed photo-bleaching in the perovskite films caused by its photo-oxidation  The photo-bleaching could be easily seen in the non-active areas of the solar cells where there was no Cu deposition  Photo-bleaching caused the color of perovskite film to fade up  During photo-bleaching process the O2 entities present in the system attacks on the chromophores of the perovskite and decompose them  CH3NH3PbI3 first decomposes into CH3NH2  PbI2 and HI that is followed by oxidation of CH3NH2 and PbI2 to convert them into CO2 and PbO respectively  The photo-bleaching under solar illumination was very fast compared to that under LED lamp illumination because photo-oxidation of the materials gets accelerated in the presence of ultraviolet ( UV ) light [ 32 ]  It is worth mentioning here that Cu also gets oxidized in the presence of O2 and H2O molecules through following chemical reactions ; ( 5 ) ( 6 ) These Cu oxides can also react with HI through following chemical reactions and contribute to degradation in PSCs ; ( 7 ) ( 8 ) We observed oxidation of Cu electrode when some of the devices were left in air under ambient conditions ( 24 ± 4 °C and 45 ± 5 % RH ) without encapsulation  After some time we could easily see the Cu electrode getting corroded by environmental O2 and H2O molecules  The oxidation in Cu electrode was visible in terms of changes in its surface color as shown in Fig  9  It is therefore very important to make sure that Cu deposition is done in very high vacuum and it does not get oxidized during deposition  If there are any Cu oxides before Cu electrode in the solar cells they will create interfacial barriers and inhibit collection of holes at Cu metal contacts and the solar cells will not perform well  Cu oxides are not good for PSCs and should be avoided to form  Fig  9 figure 9 Photographs of a Cu electrode based PSC taken after different time intervals  The solar cell was not encapsulated and stored in dark  The oxidation of top Cu electrode with time could be seen clearly by the change in its surface color Full size image 4 Conclusion We have investigated the photo-stability of CH3NH3PbI3 based PSCs with Cu as top electrode  The solar cells were prepared in normal geometry on the FTO coated glass substrates and Cu electrodes served as anode  For understanding of degradation mechanisms the solar cells were stored in different illumination conditions like in dark  under continuous illumination of a white LED lamp and under natural sunlight outside the laboratory and tested for their stability as per the ISOS-D-1  ISOS-L-1 and ISIS-O-1 protocols respectively  Under dark storage the solar cells were very stable but under continuous illumination of LED lamp the solar cells exhibited little degradation  But more interestingly under natural sunlight the solar cells degraded very fast and it was because of very severe environmental conditions outside and very strong UV and IR contents in the solar radiation  The degradation under illumination of white LED lamp or natural sunlight was mainly because of photo-oxidation of the perovskite films and their chemical reactions with Cu electrode  Though the chemical reactions were very slow in dark and under LED lamp illumination but they got accelerated under harsh outdoor conditions which led to very rapid degradation in the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells  We observed decomposition and oxidation of perovskite film  diffusion of Cu into underlying films and its chemical reactions with perovskite constituents  Though Cu electrode was expected to impart very high stability in PSCs but it also reacted with O2  H2O and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film  From these studies we can inference that Cu too is not a very stable electrode material for PSCs in very harsh environmental conditions  Therefore to ensure very high stability in PSCs and for their commercial viability we need to find out some other suitable alternate material for electrode

 Recently  perovskite is proposed as alternative material in the fabrication of solar cells  In this study  methyl ammonium lead triiodide ( MAPbI3  CH3NH3PbI3 ) perovskite thin film was prepared by two-step process of spin coating  The preparation process of thin film is summarized by reaction between the methyl ammonium iodide ( CH3NH3I ) and lead iodide ( PbI2 )  The absorbent layer of the prepared perovskite solar cell is based on the MAPbI3 ( CH3NH3PbI3 ) thin film  The conversion efficiency of p-n silicon solar cells can be improved by preparing tandem solar cells  The X-ray diffraction result of the MAPbI3 perovskite film manifested that it is polycrystalline with tetragonal system having a crystallite size of about 40 nm  The absorption spectrum of perovskite film was recorded by Ultra Violet–Visible spectrophotometer  The energy band gap of the MAPbI3 film calculated by Tauc ’ s formula was ~ 151 eV  The field emission scanning electron microscope image of the MAPbI3 film surface elucidated a cubic-like crystal structure and other irregular structures also  The atomic force microscope image and the distribution chart of the grains of the film displayed that

March 2021 1 Introduction Energy is one of the essential elements of modernization  The increase in energy demands entails the depletion of world fossil fuel resources  Moreover  the consumption of fossil energy has a detrimental side effect  which is the global warming that is caused by the enormous level of greenhouse gas emission  Therefore  scientific researchers have been focusing on developing a greener and more sustainable energy to alleviate environmental impacts [ 1 ]  Perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) based upon an organic–inorganic lead halide light harvester have taken an attracted increasing interest in the world owing to its benefits of the high power conversion efficiency ( PCE )  low price as well as easy fabrication techniques [ 2  3 ]  According to the order of preparation  the planar structure can be categorized into two types : regular ( n-i-p ) and inverted ( p-i-n ) [ 4 ]  For inverted planar hetero-junction  PSCs are  in general  based upon the structure of ( fluorine-doped tin oxide ( FTO ) /hole transport layer ( HTL ) /perovskite layer/electron transport layer ( ELT ) /metal electrode ) have attracted significant attention because of the simple processing procedure  little hysteresis and high efficiency device design [ 5  6 ]  A transparent electrode is necessary for the solar cells as it permits the arriving light to attain the photoactive layer  The transparent conductive oxides ( TCO ) like FTO is used well suited for this purpose due to its transparent and conductive nature [ 7 ]  Poly ( 34 ethylenedioxythiophene ) : polystyrene sulfonate ( PEDOT : PSS ) organic material has been used to as HTL owing to high transparency and conductivity ( 10−4 to 10−3 s/cm )  high mechanical flexibility [ 8 ] and fabrication at low temperature [ 4  5 ]  While  the inorganic methyl ammonium lead triiodide perovskite material ( MAPbI3 ) was used as a light-harvesting layer in solar cells owing to the unique optoelectronic characteristics  like ( proper straight bandgap  ambipolarity [ 9 ]  high mobility of charge carrier  the high coefficient of absorption  a steep edge of absorption  the long length of diffusion and the unique tolerance to the structural defects ) [ 2  10 ]  easy synthesis  and low cost [ 11 ]  On the other hand  organic charge transport ( PC71BM ) material was used as ETL in perovskite solar cells owing to its high electron-accepting characteristics  role as trap passivation in the perovskite film  facile synthesis  good solubility  and low processing [ 12  13 ]  Finally  the metal aluminum ( Al ) was chosen as perfectly suitable for the contact electrode due to the high conduction  The films quality and functionality as well as the complete device vigorously rely upon the deposition method and treating circumstances [ 9 ]  Numerous methods of deposition are utilized to the perovskite solar cells synthesis  comprising vapor deposition  one-step or two-step solution-treated  vapor deposition  and vapor-assisted solution methods  The two-step spin coating deposition technique has well properties  such as the effective chemical change and a better governing above the morphology and size of crystal [ 11 ]  PSCs devices have exhibited a fast and clear improvement in the energy conversion efficiency from 38 % in 2009 to 242 % in 2019 [ 14 ]  this is attributed to the excellent advantages of the perovskite material  The most straight forward method to attain the efficiencies after such a boundary at a realistic price is the combination of a silicon cell having a low-price cell with a broad-bandgap absorber material for forming tandem solar cells ( TSCs ) [ 15 ]  TSCs have been suggested to accomplish higher change efficiency than the single-junction solar cells  The TSCs comprises high and low bandgap solar cells [ 16 ]  An encouraging nominee for this a broad-bandgap top cell with the potential for low production prices being the organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cell [ 15 ]  The advantage of TSCs is that via the combination of solar cells appropriate for short and long wavelength zones  every zone of wavelength can be capably changed to an electric power  and a high output can be reached  The bottom and top cells absorb the long and short wavelength spectra  correspondingly [ 17 ]  The highest efficiency of energy change can be attained when the top cell bandgap equals to ( 17 eV )  whereas the bottom solar cell bandgap equals to ( 11 eV )  Therefore  the crystalline silicon with a ( 11 eV ) bandgap appears the optimum selection for the bottom solar cell [ 18 ]  Methyl ammonium lead triiodide ( MAPbI3 perovskite and crystal-silicon ( c-Si are fabricated in chiefly ( 2 configurations ; as monolithic two-terminal tandem ( 2-T  and mechanically stacked four-terminal ( 4-T tandem [ 19 ]  Furthermore  the solar cells are able to make a balancing pair with the big-bandgap perovskite solar cell that functions as a top cell in charge to harvest the short wavelength photons  whereas the bottom ( c-Si ) solar cell is intended for absorbing the long-wavelength photons [ 20 ]  Tandem solar cells  which are encouraging outcomes  have been done for two-terminal tandem ( 2-T ) and four-perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells reaching the efficiencies of ( 236 % ) and ( 264 % )  respectively [ 21 ]  In the present work  the perovskite MAPbI3 film was synthesized by the use of a two-step spin coating method  in which the MAI solution was spin coated on PbI2 film  The properties of prepared perovskite film were studied  In addition  the inverted perovskite solar cell was prepared by using MAPbI3 thin film as an active layer  Moreover  c-Si/ inverted perovskite tandem solar cell was designed and fabricated to improve the conversion efficiency of p-n silicon solar cells  2 Experimental section 21 Materials The materials used in this work are as follows : Methylamine ( CH3NH2  33

( 5 Ω/cm2  500 µm  from Al-Mansour company  Iraq )  22 Synthesis of methylammonium iodide ( MAI ) The methylammonium iodide ( MAI ) was synthesized using 24 ml of methylamine ( MA ) solution and 10 ml of hydroiodic acid ( HI ) solution  The two solutions were mixed into a round bottom flask stirred at 0 °C for 120 min in an ice bath under continuous stirring to obtain a white solution  Then  the resultant solution was evaporated at 80 °C for 120 min to give white precipitate  The precipitate then was washed by diethyl ether several times until it became colorless  and a white crystalline powder was formed  The solution then was filtered and desiccated in a vacuum oven at ( 60 °C ) for ( 24 h )  23 Fabrication of device The perovskite device structure is shown in Fig  1a  FTO glass substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with de-ionized water  acetone and ethanol sequentially for 15 min  PEDOT : PSS layer was then spin coated ( L2001A3  Ossila ) upon the upper FTO substrate at ( 1000 rpm ) for ( 20 s )  pursued via the annealing on hotplate at ( 120 °C ) for ( 10 min )  To prepare perovskite thin film  a two-step method was used  In the first step  PbI2 solution ( 04 g in 2 ml of DMF ) was then spin coated on the PEDOT : PSS film at ( 1000 rpm ) for ( 10 s )  pursued via the annealing at ( 100 °C ) for ( 10 min )  While in second step  MAI solution ( 001 g in 2 ml of DMF ) was deposited on PbI2 film by spin coating at ( 500 rpm for 5 s  1000 rpm for 10 s ) and then annealed at ( 100 °C ) for ( 10 min )  The color of the perovskite film changed from light yellow to dark brown  Beyond the cooling down to the room temperature  PC71BM solution ( 20 mg in 1 ml of chlorobenzene ) thin film was spin coated at ( 500 rpm for 5 s )  The mask shown in Fig  1b was used to deposit the aluminum as an electrode which fixed over the prepared films  The aluminum electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation under the pressure of 10–5 mbr  Fig  1 figure

can be improved via preparing a tandem solar cell  Silicon cell used here was purchased from Al-Mansour factory ( Baghdad/Iraq )  The cells were cleaned with HF : DI water ( 5:1 v/v ) in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min to remove the SiO2 layer that covers the front face of the silicon cell and then cleaned with DI water in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min also  Tin oxide ( SnO2 ) thin film was deposited on silicon cells by the thermal evaporation method at the room temperature under vacuum of the order of 10–5 mbar using high purity tin as the source material  here SnO2 film employed as an anti-reflection layer [ 22 ]  Following  the annealing of deposited film was conducted at ( 400 °C ) for ( 1 h )  Aluminum layer was deposited by thermal evaporation technique on the backside of silicon cells  To form a two-terminal tandem solar cell  the two cells ( PS and Si ) were mechanically stacked on the top of each other  Then  the electrolyte solution was injected by a syringe between the two cells  Finally  FTO and Al electrodes were connected electrically to Keithley source by wires to an efficiency test  as displayed in Fig  1c  24 Characterization The crystalline phase and crystallite size of perovskite film were characterized via X-ray Diffractometer  type Shimadzu 6000type ( Japan ) utilizing CuKα radiation ( λ = 15406 Å ) scan from 10° to 60°  The morphology of the perovskite film surface was examined via a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope ( FE-SEM  Zeiss  SUPRA 55 ) type  Optical absorbance for perovskite layer was obtained at the room temperature via ( UV–VIS-NIR ) spectrophotometer ( type Shimadzu  UV-1800 )  The characteristics of the Current–Voltage ( I-V ) of silicon  perovskite as well as tandem solar cells were tested using a Keithley 2400 source meter under a standard simulated light source of AM 15 G conditions ( 1000 W/cm2 )  Depending upon the ( I–V ) curve  the fill factor ( FF ) was computed by the following equation [ 23 ] : FF left (  % right ) = frac { { P_ { max } } } { { J_ { SC }  V_ { OC } } } times 100 ( 1 ) where : Pmax : The maximum power  Jsc : The density of the short-circuit photocurrent  Voc : The open-circuit photovoltage  The efficiency ( ɳ ) of photoelectric conversion was computed by this formula [ 24 ] : eta left (  % right ) = frac { { J_ { SC } cdot V_ { OC } cdot FF } } { { P_ { in } } } times 100 ( 2 ) where  Pinp is the incident power  3 Results and analysis 31 X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) analysis The crystalline phase and the preferred orientation of SnO2 film deposited via the process of thermal evaporation upon a glass substrate were obtained by the XRD technique  The X-ray diffraction patterns of the SnO2 thin film are shown in Fig  2a  The patterns indicate well-defined XRD peaks of crystallized SnO2 which were indexed to the tetragonal phase  which is consistent with the JCPDS card no  41-1445  and such result agrees with those documented by [ 25 ]  Consequently  the XRD results revealed that the film obtained in this study consisted of a pure SnO2 phase without any secondary phases  Fig  2 figure 2 XRD patterns of : a SnO2 thin film and b MAPbI3 perovskite film on glass Full size image The crystal structure  crystallite size  and the prepared perovskite thin film phase were obtained utilizing XRD  The X-ray diffraction patterns of MAPbI3 thin film deposited on the glass substrate by spin coating method are displayed in Fig  2b  A set of pronounced peaks at 2θ with 1409°  1996°  2348°  2447°  2842°  3177°  3499°  4043°  4307° and 5020° corresponding to the ( 110 )  ( 112 )  ( 211 )  ( 202 )  ( 220 )  ( 222 )  ( 312 )  ( 224 )  ( 314 ) and ( 404 ) planes of the MAPbI3 tetragonal phase  correspondingly  which is in a good agreement with other documented researches [ 262728 ]  From the figure  no peaks associated with remaining PbI2 and other phases of perovskite were observed  signifying that the deposited thin films are in pure phase and crystalline in nature [ 29 ]  The presence of the higher number of diffraction peaks indicates the successful conversion into the perovskite structure  Similar results were obtained in earlier reports [ 30313233 ]  Also from the figure  it was noted that ( 110 ) is the main preferred direction in the crystal growth of perovskite  The perovskite film with the oriented crystalline domains thus ensures the high charge mobility necessary for the high-performance solar cells [ 34 ]  Consequently  enhancing the crystal orientation and the perovskite film crystallinity are good for the performance of optoelectronic devices  The crystallite size ( D ) was estimated by Scherrer ’ s formula [ 35 ] : D = frac { Klambda } { { beta COStheta } } ( 3 ) where  ( K ) is constant  ( λ ) is the wavelength of x-ray  which is equal to 015406 nm  ( β ) is the full-width at half-maximum  and ( θ ) is Bragg angle [ 36 ]  The perovskite film lattice parameters were estimated as a = b = 88762 Å and c = 126383 Å  The average crystallite size of the synthesized perovskite film was obtained to be ( 40 nm )  32 Field emission scanning electron microscopy ( FE-SEM ) analysis The surface morphology of perovskite thin film deposited on FTO substrate was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy  The top-view FE-SEM image of the film is manifested in Fig  3 revealing that the film has a polycrystalline nature in the nano-scale  As observed from the FE-SEM image  cuboid-like crystals and other irregular ones are formed [ 37 ]  The top view of a perovskite film prepared depicts that the FTO substrate is not fully covered by the perovskite layer  and the perovskite aggregates  which led to the formation of islands  were observed [ 38 ]  From the image  the large grain size of perovskite crystal and the presence of some voids or pinholes among the perovskite grains were noted [ 39 ]  The few pinholes present in the perovskite layer may be attributed to the subsequent growth [ 40 ]  The pinholes can produce direct contacts of a hole transporting layer and an electron transporting layer  which causes poorer performance and big hysteresis in the perovskite solar cells current density–voltage ( J-V ) curve [ 30 ]  Additionally  the large grains size presence in the film has a large vitality for the perovskite film-based optoelectronic apparatuses  since the decreased charge recombination at the grain boundaries as well as the carrier of charge can transport and be efficiently gathered in the big grains of crystal [ 41 ]  Fig  3 figure 3 FE-SEM image of top-view of perovskite film Full size image 33 Atomic force microscope ( AFM ) analysis Atomic force microscopy measurement was performed to investigate the surface topography of the perovskite film made via the spin-coated technique upon the FTO glass  Figure 4a and b display the 3D image of AFM and the chart of the granularity cumulative distribution of the film of perovskite  The grain size  the average roughness and the root mean square of the thin film was about 587 nm  151 nm and 181 nm  respectively  From the results ( AFM image )  the film containing a large grain size was noted  Some studies indicated that a larger perovskite crystal size favors the light absorbance [ 42 ]  The large grain size leads to decrease the grain boundary with the carrier trapping sites and suppresses the charge recombination  which makes for increasing the carrier transport mobility in MAPbI3 film and the electrons injection to the PEDOT : PSS layer from the perovskite layer [ 43 ]  which is an important reason for the increase of conversion efficiency of the perovskite device  Fig  4 figure 4 a Perovskite thin film 3D ( AFM ) image and b Chart of the granularity Cumulative Distribution of perovskite film Full size image 34 Ultraviolet–Visible-infrared spectrophotometer ( UV–Vis-NIR ) analysis Figure 5 elucidates the UV–Vis absorption spectra of the perovskite thin film cast on the glass substrate  As explained in Fig  5a  the perovskite film absorption spectra cover the light ’ s broad range from the visible region to the near-IR region  depicting the MAPbI3 perovskite formation during reaction [ 44 ] and also the improved crystallinity  which is in a good agreement with previously reported works [ 33 ]  In addition  the spectra of the film show the absorption onsets at 800 nm nearly [ 45 ]  suggesting the strong light absorption for the perovskite film  which works as the solar cells active layer  and causing the higher short-circuit current density ( JSC ) [ 15 ]  The spectra exhibit three distinct peaks located at ~ 420 nm  520 nm and 756 nm  respectively [ 46 ]  The first peak of absorption at ( 756 nm ) matches to the straight bandgap shift from the initial valence band ( VB1 ) to the conduction band ( CB ) demonstrating that the material ’ s photogeneration initiates at that wavelength  while the other peaks at ( 520 nm ) and ( 420 nm ) attributed to the shift from the second ( VB2 ) and the third valence band ( VB3 ) to ( CB ) [ 44 ]  From the figure  it was observed that the reduction in the absorbance is in the region ( 550–725 nm ) which is the feature of the MAPbI3 film deposited using DMF solvent [ 47 ]  Fig  5 figure 5 UV–Vis-NIR absorption spectra of perovskite film Full size image Tauc ’ s model is employed to quantify the optical bandgap of MAPbI3 film using the following equation [ 48 ] : alpha hnu = A   ( hnu - E_ { g } ) ^ { n } ( 4 ) where  ( α ) is the coefficient of absorption  ( hν ) is the energy of photon  ( A ) is a constant that doesn ’ t relies upon energy of photon  ( Eg ) is the optical bandgap and ( n ) possesses four numeric values ( 1/2 for allowed direct  ( 2 ) for allowed indirect  ( 3 ) for forbidden direct and ( 3/2 ) for forbidden indirect optical shifts ) [ 49 ]  Figure 6 displays the Tauc ’ s plot  where the allowed direct band gap of the MAPbI3 film can be estimated by the intercept of the extrapolation of the straight line portion of the plot at ( αhν ) 2 = 0  From the Tauc ’ s plot  it was observed that the direct optical bandgap value of perovskite film is approximately 151 eV  which is in good agreement with the previously reported articles [ 50 ]  Fig  6 figure 6 Tauc ’ s plot of perovskite film Full size image 35 Photovoltaic performance analysis

shown in Table 2  The tandem device prepared in this study recorded less efficiency compared to the references [ 35  36  51 ]  this attributed to several reasons  including the large active area and the use of an inverted structure to prepare the device  In addition  the reason for the emergence of pinholes in the perovskite film led to a decrease in the performance of the device  Table 2 Comparison between the efficiency of the tandem device and previous studies Full size table 4 Conclusions In this study  the perovskite solar cell was successfully fabricated  The XRD analysis manifested that the MAPbI3 thin film prepared by spin coating method is appeared to be polycrystalline with nanostructure  According to the absorption spectra  the MAPbI3 film is characterized by a wide range of absorption  which extends from the visible region to the infrared region and is therefore used as an absorbent layer in the solar cells  The efficiency of the silicon cells was improved by the fabrication of a new type of solar cells  which is a tandem device  The tandem device recorded higher efficiency compared to perovskite and silicon devices  Change history 31 August 2020The

to improve the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 2D perovskite solar cells ( PVSCs )  In this paper  the deionized water ( H2O ) additive is introduced into the perovskite precursor solution to prepare high-quality 2D perovskite films  The 2D perovskite film treated with 3 % H2O shows a good surface morphology  increased crystal size  enhanced crystallinity  preferred orientation  and low defect density  The fabricated 2D PVSC with 3 % H2O exhibits a higher PCE compared with that without H2O ( 1215 % vs 229 % )  Furthermore  the shelf stability of unsealed devices with 3 % H2O under ambient environment is significantly improved  This work provides a simple method to prepare high-quality 2D perovskite films for efficient and stable 2D PVSCs  Introduction Recently  two-dimensional ( 2D ) layered perovskites have drawn extensive attention due to their enhanced moisture resistance versus their 3D counterparts  such as CH3NH3PbI3 ( MAPbI3 ) and HC ( NH2 ) 2PbI3 ( FAPbI3 )  The 2D perovskite with the formula of A2Bn − 1MnX3n + 1 ( Ruddlesden−Popper phase )  where B is MA+  FA+  or Cs+  M is Pb2+ or Sn2+  X stands for halide anion  n refers to the number of planes of the corner-sharing [ MX6 ] 4− octahedral  can be formed by incorporating organic long-chain ligands A ( such as phenethylammonium ( PEA+ ) or butylammonium ( BA+ ) ) in the inorganic framework  These 2D perovskites possess many unique optoelectronic properties  and have been developed for use in both solar cells [ 1  2 ] and light-emitting diodes [ 3 ]  However  the exciton binding energy of the layered 2D perovskite is enhanced on account of the dielectric confinement effect between the organic layer and the inorganic framework [ 4 ]  which substantially limits the exciton dissociation in the electrical field [ 5 ]  Meanwhile  the bulky organic ligands would form insulating spacing layers and inhibit charge transport between neighboring inorganic slabs  Thus  the PCE of 2D PVSCs is much lower than that of their 3D counterparts  which has been already above 25 % [ 6 ]  To obtain high-performance 2D PVSCs  many efforts have been made  including the hot-coasting [ 7 ]  additive engineering [ 891011121314 ]  composition engineering [ 151617181920212223242526 ]  precursor solvent engineering [ 27282930 ]  interfacial engineering [ 3132333435 ]  and other special treatments [ 13  36  37 ]  Among these methods  additive engineering is the frequently used method due to its simplicity and effectiveness  Zhang et al  found that the vertically oriented 2D layered perovskite film can be deposited via incorporating ammonium thiocyanate ( NH4SCN ) additive into the perovskite precursor solution [ 8  9 ]  Therefore  the PCE of 2D PVSCs drastically increases from 056 to 1101 %  Qing et al  demonstrated that the quality of 2D perovskite film can be improved by a synergistic effect of two additives in the perovskite precursor solution [ 10 ]  Consequently  a hysteresis-free 2D PVSCs with a PCE exceeding 12 % has been obtained  Yu et al  showed that the film morphology and the charge transportation in perovskites can be effectively controlled through adding both ammonium chloride ( NH4Cl ) additive and dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) solvent into the precursor solution and a PCE of 1341 % was achieved [ 11 ]  Fu et al  reported an efficient 2D PVSCs processed with NH4SCN and NH4Cl additives  yielding an optimal PCE of 141 % [ 12 ]  In our previous work  we found that DMSO and thiosemicarbazide ( TSC ) exhibit a synergistic effect in improving the morphology  crystallization  and orientation of 2D perovskite films [ 14 ]  It is speculated that both DMSO and TSC are Lewis bases [ 38 ]  which regulate the crystallization process of 2D perovskite through coordination with the perovskite precursor components  As a result  the efficient and stable 2D PVSCs with a champion PCE of 1415 % were obtained  In the Lewis acid−base concept  a water molecule is an oxygen donor Lewis base that can bond with the lead iodide ( PbI2 ) Lewis acid  Meanwhile  the physical and chemical thermodynamic properties of water molecules  like boiling point  solubility  and vapor pressure  are different from frequently-used N  N-dimethylformamide ( DMF ) solvent  A series of studies have revealed that the water added into the perovskite precursor solution can control the 3D perovskite crystallization  leading to a better photovoltaic performance [ 394041424344 ]  However  as we all know  using H2O as an additive in 2D PVSC has not been reported yet so far  In this study  water molecules as additive were introduced into perovskite precursor solutions to control the crystallization of 2D perovskite film  The 2D perovskite film ( BA2MA3Pb4I13  n = 4 ) treated with a suitable amount of water shows good film morphology  enhanced crystallinity and increased orientation ordering  This high-quality 2D perovskite film contributes to the lower trap-state density and then higher photovoltaic performance of 2D PVSCs  The PCE of 2D PVSCs has been improved from 229 to 1215 %  More interestingly  water additive based devices exhibit obviously improved shelf stability

Polymer Light Technology Cory  DMF  chlorobenzene  and acetonitrile were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich  Isopropanol was purchased from You Xuan Tech  All reagents and solvents were used directly without further purification  Precursor Solution The pristine BA2MA3Pb4I13 precursor solution ( 085 M ) was prepared by mixing BAI  MAI  PbI2 with a molar ratio of 05 : 075 : 1 in DMF  The precursors with various amounts of deionized water were prepared by adding different volume ratios of deionized water into the pristine precursor solution  Device Fabrication The indium tin oxide ( ITO ) substrates were ultrasonically washed with detergent  acetone  absolute ethyl alcohol  and deionized water in succession  followed by a 15 min UV-ozone treatment  For the hole collection layers  PEDOT : PSS aqueous solution was spin-coated onto the cleaned ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 40 s After the spin-coating  the PEDOT : PSS films were heated in air at 150 °C for 15 min  and then transferred into the glovebox  For the photoelectric conversion layers  the ITO/PEDOT : PSS substrates were preheated at 100 °C for 3 min  followed by spin coating different perovskite precursor solutions at 5000 rpm for 25 s and then annealing at 100 °C for 10 min  For the electron extraction layers  the solution of PC61BM ( 15 mg/mL in chlorobenzene ) was spin-coated onto the perovskite layers at 2000 rpm for 30 s Next  BCP in isopropanol with a concentration of 08 mg/ml was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 30 s Finally  70 nm Ag electrodes were thermally evaporated on the BCP layers through the shadow masks  The effective device area was 004 cm2  For the preparation of hole-only devices  the spiro-OMeTAD layers were deposited onto the 2D perovskite/PEDOT : PSS/ITO substrates by spin-coating spiro-OMeTAD solution at 4000 rpm for 30 s followed by evaporation of 70 nm gold electrode on the top of the device  The spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 90 mg spiro-OMeTAD  22 μL of a stock solution of 520 mg/mL lithium bis ( trifluoromethylsulphonyl ) imide in acetonitrile and 36 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine in 1 mL chlorobenzene  Measurement and Characterization The current density-voltage ( J-V ) curves of PVSCs were measured by Keithley source unit 2400 under AM 15G sun intensity illumination by a solar simulator from Newport Corp  The scanning rate of J-V curves is 02 V/s  Scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) measurements were conducted on field emission fitting SEM ( FEI-Inspect F50  Holland )  The grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scatting ( GIWAXS ) measurements were conducted at BL14B1 beamline at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility  Shanghai  China  with a 06887 Å primary beam  02° incident angle  The absorption spectrum of 2D perovskite was measured using Shimadzu 1500 spectrophotometer  External quantum efficiencies were measured by QTEST HIFINITY 5 ( Crowntech )  Time-resolved photoluminescence spectrum was performed with a Fluo Time 300 ( Pico Quant ) spectrofluorometer  Results and Discussion To investigate the influence of H2O additive on the performance of 2D PVSCs  we fabricated the inverted devices with the configuration of indium tin oxide ( ITO ) /PEDOT : PSS/BA2MA3Pb4I13/PC61BM/BCP/Ag as shown in Fig  1a  The deionized water was mixed with perovskite precursor solution with a varied volume ratio from 0 to 5 %  The photocurrent density–voltage ( J–V ) curves of the champion 2D PVSCs based on perovskite with various amounts of water additive under illumination of AM 15G  100 mW/cm2 are shown in Fig  1b  and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1  The control device without water additive exhibits a low open-circuit voltage ( Voc ) of 084 V  a short-circuit current density ( Jsc ) of 573 mA/cm2  a fill factor ( FF ) of 4763 %  resulting in a poor PCE of 229 %  From Table 1  it is clear that the suitable amount of H2O additive improves the corresponding photovoltaic performance of the devices dramatically  In the case of 2D perovskite with 3 % H2O  the best-performing device shows a PCE of 1215 %  with a Voc of 106 V  Jsc of 1580 mA/cm2  and FF of 7256 %  The significant improvement in PCE is attributed to the additive-treated perovskite film  which shows a higher crystallinity  larger brick-like grains  uniform morphology  and vertical-orientation perpendicular to the substrate  The details will be discussed below  By further increasing the volume ratio of H2O to 5 %  the photovoltaic parameters of PVSCs were deteriorated  Figure 1c presents the steady-state photocurrent density where PCE is a function of time at the maximum power point ( 084 V )  The PCE of the champion device with 3 % H2O stabilizes at 1178 % ( black ) with a photocurrent density of 1402 mA/cm2 ( red ) in the scan time of 200 s  and it is close to the value extracted from J-V curve  Importantly  the shelf stability is one of the key requirements for practical application of PVSCs  Both the unsealed devices without and with 3 % H2O were stored in air atmosphere with relative humidity of 25 ± 5 % at 25 °C to examined evolution of their PCE as a function of time  As shown in Fig  1d  the device with 3 % H2O still retained 8576 % of its initial PCE after 720 h  which was much stable than that of the device without H2O ( 5276 % )  The significantly improved stability is attributed to the stable hydrated 2D perovskites that may be generated during the spin-coating and annealing process  The stable hydrated 2D perovskites resist the decomposition of 2D perovskite film to some extent [ 39  40 ]  On the basis of above results  we conclude that the device treated with optimal water content not only yields superior photovoltaic performance but also shows a good stability  Fig  1 figure 1 a Schematic illustration of PVSC structure  b J-V curves of PVSCs based on BA2MA3Pb4I13 films deposited from perovskite precursor solutions

in each case are shown in Fig  2a–d  The devices without and with 15 %  3 %  and 5 % H2O present the best PCE of 229 %  763 %  1215 %  and 1038 % with the average value of 185 %  659 %  1138 %  and 902 %  respectively ( Table 1 )  These statistical data show the same tends as their corresponding champion devices  proving the statistically meaningful performance improvements of the device upon a suitable amount of deionized water  Fig  2 figure 2 Statistic distribution for ( a ) Voc  ( b ) Jsc  ( c ) FF  and ( d ) PCE of 2D PVSCs based on BA2MA3Pb4I13 films with various amounts of H2O additive Full size image The SEM was conducted to evaluate the effects of H2O additive on morphology and coverage of 2D perovskite films  The top-view SEM images of BA2MA3Pb4I13 film with various amounts of H2O additive are shown in Fig  3a-c  and the corresponding cross-section SEM images are shown in the insets of Fig  3a-c  The perovskite film without H2O ( denoted as perovskite-w/o H2O ) exhibits a poor morphology with small amounts of cracks and pinholes  while the film with 3 % H2O ( denoted as perovskite-3 % H2O ) shows a more uniform surface without cracks  A large amount of voids and cracks can be observed when 5 % H2O ( denoted as perovskite-5 % H2O ) was added  which is mainly due to the decomposition of the hydrate perovskite caused by excessive bulk H2O [ 41 ]  Besides  as shown in the inset of Fig  3a  the film without H2O additive is constructed of random-oriented small crystalline grains with lots of grain boundaries  The grain size of the perovskite-3 % H2O film is larger than that of the perovskite-5 % H2O film  though they both exhibit a vertically oriented brick-like morphology  The larger grains in 2D perovskite film results in almost no grain boundary along the vertical direction  It has been reported that grain boundaries are regions where the trap states are mainly distributed [ 45  46 ]  Therefore  the perovskite-3 % H2O films with larger vertically oriented crystal grains contribute to efficient PVSCs  Fig  3 figure 3 a-c Top-view SEM images and cross-section SEM images ( insets ) of BA2MA3Pb4I13 films with various amounts of H2O additive  GIWAXS patterns of BA2MA3Pb4I13 film : ( d ) without H2O additive and ( e ) with 3 % H2O additive Full size image The GIWAXS patterns have been used to identify the role of water additive in the crystal growth of 2D perovskite films further  We speculate that water additive can regulate the crystallization process of perovskite because of its lower boiling point and higher vapor pressure compared with DMF [ 40 ]  Furthermore  incorporating a suitable amount of water into DMF increases the solubility of perovskite ionic compound  leading to the improved quality of the perovskite films with enhanced crystallinity [ 47 ]  The SEM and GIWAXS results in this work are consistent with the speculation  As shown in Fig  3d  the perovskite-w/o H2O film displays several Bragg rings at specific q values  indicating mainly random oriented crystal grains within this polycrystalline film  However  the perovskite-3 % H2O film shows sharp and discrete Bragg spots along the same q position ( Fig  3e )  which suggests the well-aligned crystal grains with ( 111 ) planes parallel to the substrate [ 17 ]  Moreover  the darker Bragg spots are observed in perovskite-3 % H2O film whereas the less apparent diffraction rings in perovskite-w/o H2O film  which demonstrates the increased crystallinity of perovskite-3 % H2O film  The highly oriented perovskite-3 % H2O film that is perpendicular to the substrate can form an efficient carrier transport channel  leading to improved photovoltaic performance [ 14  17 ]  To reveal the impact of morphological and crystallographic changes resulted from the addition of water on the optical properties of films  we carried out absorption spectroscopy measurement  as shown in Fig  4a  Both the perovskite-w/o H2O film and the perovskite-3 % H2O film exhibit multiple exciton absorption peaks in the UV-Vis absorption spectra  indicating the existence of multiple perovskite phases with different n values  although nominally prepared as “ n = 4 ”  However  the perovskite-3 % H2O film shows a slightly enhanced absorption in the range of 400-600 nm compared with the perovskite-w/o H2O film  From the cross-section SEM images ( insets of Fig  3a-c )  it can be concluded that all 2D perovskite films show almost the same thickness  Thus  we attribute the enhanced absorption to a uniform  highly crystalline  and highly oriented perovskite film induced by water additive [ 14  48 ]  The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectrums of PVSC without H2O additive and PVSC with 3 % H2O are shown in Fig  4b  and the corresponding derived integrated current values are plotted on the right y-axis  The integrated Jsc from EQE spectrum of PVSC without H2O additive and the PVSC with 3 % H2O is 516 mA/cm2 and 1520 mA/cm2  respectively  The values are close to the results measured from J–V curve  Apparently  the EQE values of the device with 3 % H2O in most visible light range are much higher than that of the device without additive  This phenomenon not only results from enhanced light absorption but also mainly comes from more efficient charge transport in highly oriented 2D perovskite film with better crystallinity  Fig  4 figure 4 a Absorption spectra of BA2MA3Pb4I13 films without and with 3 % H2O  b EQE spectra and integrated current curve of corresponding devices  c Dark current-voltage curves of the HODs based on corresponding 2D perovskite films ( inset : configuration of HODs )  d TRPL spectra of corresponding 2D perovskite films Full size image Further  we measured the dark current-voltage curves of the hole-only devices ( HODs ) with a structure of ITO/PEDOT : PSS/2D perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au to characterize the trap-state density ( Nt ) in 2D perovskite films ( Fig  4v )  The Nt was determined by the trap-filled limit voltage ( VTFL ) according to equation ( 1 ) [ 14  46  49 ] : ( 1 ) where εo is the vacuum permittivity  εr is the relative dielectric constant of 2D perovskite  q is the elemental charge  and L is the thickness of the 2D perovskite film  Both perovskite films have the same εr value and the same thickness  Therefore  the Nt is positively correlated with the VTFL value  As shown in Fig  4c  the VTFL value obtained from 2D perovskite-3 % H2O based HOD is obviously lower than that obtained from 2D perovskite-w/o H2O based HOD  It demonstrates that trap-state density in the 2D perovskite-3 % H2O film has been reduced  This was further confirmed by the time-resolved photoluminescence ( TRPL ) spectra of the 2D perovskite films deposited on nonconductive glass  The time decay of the fluorescence signals was fitted to two exponentials  as depicted in Fig  4d  Benefited from high-quality films with few grain boundaries as evidenced in Fig  2  the 2D perovskite-3 % H2O film has a longer fluorescence lifetime of 10 ns compared with 2D perovskite-w/o H2O film ( 2 ns )  demonstrating the reduced bulk defect density in 2D perovskite-3 % H2O film  Based on all above results  we prove that incorporating suitable water additive in precursor solution can control the crystal growth of BA2MA3Pb4I13 perovskite film with enlarged grain size and uniform film coverage  leading to a reduced trap-state density  And this highly crystalline and highly oriented BA2MA3Pb4I13 perovskite films induced by water additive would facilitate charge transport [ 8  9  14 ]  Therefore  the high-quality BA2MA3Pb4I13 perovskite films bring a comprehensive improvement in Voc  Jsc  FF of the corresponding PVSCs  Conclusion In conclusion  we have investigated the effects of H2O additive on 2D BA2MA3Pb4I13 perovskite thin films and the corresponding device performance  By optimizing the amount of H2O additive  surface morphology  grain size  and crystallinity of the BA2MA3Pb4I13 film are obviously improved and preferred crystalline orientation was obtained  Therefore  optimized 3 % H2O additive based 2D PVSC yields a significant improvement in PCE from 229 to 1215 %  Meanwhile  the shelf stability of the devices is also improved  Our results prove that controlling 2D perovskite crystallization via H2O additive is an effective way to obtain efficient and stable 2D PVSCs  Availability of Data and Materials All the data are fully available without restrictions  Abbreviations 2D : Two-dimensional PCE : Power

resources offering better device performance and cost-effectiveness  the perovskite solar cell ( PSC ) is the futuristic substitution for conventional energy resources  The recent advancement in organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells  the methylammonium ( MAPI ) lead halide has revolutionized due to their high light-harvesting characteristics [ 1  2 ]  Apart from a great absorption characteristic  the MAPI in the PSC has gained extensive attention because of their superior optoelectronic properties like ideal bandgap  high charge mobility  large absorption coefficient  and small exciton binding energy  respectively [ 3456 ]  The MAPI has also fascinated the attention due to outstanding absorbing property which offers a very high PCE of the PSC device  To enhance the efficiency of the device  the flexibility in its device structures is very important  Thus  we introduced a scattering interface in the active layer which may cause to enhance the absorption in the device  Carrying forward  it will also impact the stability of the device  So  the better thoughtful knowledge in the device characteristic machinery is mandatory to optimize efficiency [ 7  8 ]  In that prospective Ag  cathode material offers high device characteristics at a very cheap cost  Meanwhile  the superior electrical property of MAPI organometal halide can be used in solid-state sensitizer as well [ 9 ]  As it started in the year of 2009 when Kojima et al  [ 10 ] used perovskite in photovoltaic and reported the value of efficiency rates 381 and 313 % for MAPI based PSC with different halide materials [ 111213 ]  Since then numerous study in the field of PSC has been carried out  Thus  the structural property behind the understanding of perovskite solar cell is crucial which is denoted as ABX3  where A structure is considered as an organic-inorganic ion  B is a divalent small metallic cation  and X is a halide which binds with cations  By varying the A  B  and X ions  optical and electrical properties of the ABX3 perovskite structure can be tuned  In the simulation study  the proposed perovskite solar cells structure of glass ∕ITO∕TaTm∕MAPI∕C60∕Ag or Au  where TaTm acts as P-type material  C60 as N-type material  MAPI functions as an absorber layer  and glass used as a substrate  Also  ITO used as an electrode to the front contact  and Ag used as the back contact  Then the influences of incident light wavelengths and the layer thickness of perovskite absorbers on photovoltaic parameters were predominantly investigated by introducing a scattering layer in the MAPI layer with different cathode materials  2 Device Simulation Parameters The present PSC devices are simulated by three input layers ; material TaTm acts as ETL  C60 is functioning as HTL  and MAPI is an active layer  ITO is an electrode used in the front contact and silver ( Ag ) is a cathode in the back contact in the simulated device structure  which is represented in Fig  1a  Simultaneously  the corresponding energy levels in the corresponding layer of the device level are also represented in Fig  1b  Perovskite absorber absorbs photons having energy higher than 15 eV which creates excitons within this photoactive layer  The parameters utilized for the present study of MAPI based PSC are shown in Table 1  where Eg is bandgap energy in eV scale  Nc and Nv are called effective density of states ( EDS ) of the conduction band and valence band in m−3  μn  and μp are the electron and hole mobility in cm2/V s scale  respectively  The band diagram of the PSC is represented in the simulated device structure  Fig  1 figure 1 a The schematic layer of simulated PSC device with b corresponding energy band diagram with CB and VB for the present study Full size image Table 1 The input parameters in MAPI based PSC Full size table 21 Parameters Used During the Simulation of MAPI Based PSC The simulated PSC device structures are represented as shown below  D1 ( nm ) : ITO ( 120 ) /TaTm ( 50 ) /MAPI ( without scattering ) ( 500 ) /C60 ( 50 ) /Ag ( 100 ) D2 ( nm ) : ITO ( 120 ) /TaTm ( 50 ) /MAPI ( with scattering ) ( 500 ) /C60 ( 50 ) /Ag ( 100 ) D3 ( nm ) : ITO ( 120 ) /TaTm ( 50 ) /MAPI ( without scattering ) ( 500 ) /C60 ( 50 ) /Au ( 100 ) D4 ( nm ) : ITO ( 120 ) /TaTm ( 50 ) /MAPI ( with scattering ) ( 500 ) /C60 ( 50 ) /Au ( 100 )  3 Results and Discussion In depicted Fig  2a  profile for the absorbance describes how much light absorbs out of the harvesting light inside the different device structures D1–D4  respectively  The overall absorbance rate is due to consecutive layers of the device is depicted in the figure  out of which the absorbance spectrum reaches a maximum in the absorber layer interface and reduces at a very fast rate due to the minor diffusion span in charge carriers  Hence  by imposing a scattering layer in the perovskite active layer  the optical path of the incident photon can be increased which results in enhancing the absorbance rate between the wavelength range of 380–780 nm  respectively  Similarly  in the device D2  the reflective index of the anode material Ag is smaller than anode material Au which results in more light to transmit through the device  Thus  the absorbance profile for device D2 increased up to 90–95 % for the perovskite solar cell  due to the triggering the optical pathway by scattering layer throughout the spectrum region  Fig  2 figure 2 The variation in a absorbance profile measured at different PSC structure over the wavelength at 15AM solar spectral irradiance and b reflectance and c transmittance profile for the PSC devices Full size image Figure 2b shows the reflectance spanning over the wavelength for differently structured perovskite solar cell structure D1–D4  It can be noted that the less reflectance results in more effective perovskite solar cell device  Taking into account  in the present study D2 achieved lesser reflectance about 10 % since the active layer contains the scattering interface which reduces the reflectance in the active layer influencing the incident light to enter through the device  In D1 and D3 structures  since the optical path is lesser than D2 and D4  it causes more reflectance up to 20 and 30 %  respectively  in the PSC  Precisely in D3  the Au layer has a more refractive index than Ag in D1  for which reflectance is more in D3 than D1  Figure 2c gives the transmittance of the perovskite solar cell for D1–D4 device structures  As more absorbance results in less transmittance rate of the incident light decrease with the scattering layer since it traps more photons in respective active layers of the device  Resulting in decreasing the transmittance in the other layers of the perovskite solar cell  For a 500 nm thick active layer in the perovskite solar cell  we achieved maximum absorbance and minimum reflectance and transmittance for the D2 structure  The simulated photovoltaic characteristics ( J-V curve ) are represented through Fig  3  In the device structure D2  due to imposing a scattering layer in the perovskite active layer gives the best outcome of Jsc and FF  respectively  Since Jsc is proportional to the field intensity  the active layer which imitates that Jsc may be moderated from imposing the scattering layer which enhances the light absorption due to attaining the longer optical path  The lower mobility of charge carriers  regardless of higher absorbance  Jsc and Voc value increases for thicker perovskite layer at an externally applied voltage of 1 V Therefore  in our device structure  we used an optimized thickness in the PSC active layer of 500 nm as reported by Adhikari et al  [ 14 ]  Figure 3 shows the dependency of Jsc and Voc on device structures D1  D2 under the illumination of AM15  Whereas  the PCE of the device in different perovskite solar structures D1–D4 is calculated  respectively  as shown in Fig  4  For device D2 of MAPI based perovskite solar cell  we get maximum FF and PCE about 1049 %  Fig  3 figure 3 The photovoltaic characteristics of J-V characteristics at an applied voltage of 1 V across the junction Full size image Fig  4 figure 4 The power conversion efficiency of PSC structure at AM15 illumination and applied voltage 1 V in the PSC Full size image As the above figure implies  Voc  Jsc  and FF of the PSC improved by introducing the scattering interface in the active layer since escalating the layer thickness absorbs photons with longer wavelengths  As the increment in the device parameters for D2 improves the conversion of input power at 1 V of potential  Usually  the results in the generation of excitons further improve the electrical parameters of the PSC device  This relates to more generations in carriers and further optimizes in enhancing device efficiency  The comparison of different structured PSC structure is given below  In Fig  5a  the comparative statement for the different device structure D1–D4 are shown at the AM15 illuminance  Current density ( Jsc ) for the device D2 is depicted to be the maximum about 157995 mA cm−2 and open-circuit voltage ( Voc ) of 08298 volts is also obtained in the study  Similarly  the D2 device offered optimum power conversion efficiency of 1049 %  Since the scattering effect enhances the voltage and current for higher absorbance in the active layer region triggering the generation of excitons in the simulation study of PSC since a higher generation of excitons enhances the current and voltage in the PSC device [ 15 ]  In D2  the effect of more voltage production leads to improving the FF up to 0834  Fig  5 figure 5 The simulated result comparison of the different parameters of the MAPI based solar cell Full size image 4 Summary/Conclusion In summary  the study of effect due to the scattering layer interface of perovskite solar cell which is introduced between the HTL and MAPI layer with distinct cathode combinations is carried out using a commercially available software package  It observed that the power conversion efficiency is higher for the perovskite layer with 500 nm thickness  It is also evident from this investigation that with the optimum perovskite layer thickness  the device parameters like open-circuit voltage ( Voc ) about 08298 V  short circuit current ( Jsc ) as 157995 mA cm−2  and fill factor ( FF ) nearly 08035  with PCE reaching significantly high up to 1049 %  respectively  corresponding to the incident light with a wavelength range 350 nm - 800 nm  This result provides pathways for future improvement of PSC with a better suitable optimization mechanism  References Wu HQ  Xue C  Li Y  Zhou P  Liu W  Zhu J  Dai S  Zhu C  Yang S ( 2019 ) Simulation of perovskite solar cells by

Introduction Since their first demonstration in dye-sensitized solar cells by Miyasaka et al  in 2009 [ 1 ]  metal halide perovskites have gathered enormous attention from the scientific community as excellent sunlight absorber materials for high efficiency and inexpensive photovoltaic applications  The steep rise in efficiencies from 3 % to ~ 23 % in a span of less than a decade has been remarkable and such meteoric upsurge in device efficiencies have not been noticed in other photovoltaic technologies to date [ 123 ]  Much of this success can be attributed to a number of favorable semiconducting properties of perovskite including tunable bandgap  long minority carrier lifetime and hence long diffusion length  high absorption coefficient  ultralow Urbach energy and high tolerance to defects [ 4  5 ]  Moreover  the use of naturally abundant materials and the ability to be processed by solution-based methods make them attractive for low-cost manufacturing  In general  the metal halide perovskite material has the general formula of ABX3  where A is a big size monovalent cation ( either organic or inorganic ) eg  methyl-ammonium ( MA )  CH3NH3+ or formamidinum ( FA )  CH2 ( NH2 ) + 2 or Cs+  or Rb+ ; B is a divalent small metallic cation ( eg  Cu2+  Mg2+  Ge2+  Sn2+  Pb2+  Eu2+  Yb2+ etc  ) and X is a monovalent halide anion ( eg  Cl−  Br−  I− etc  ) which binds to both cations [ 6 ]  The most commonly studied class of perovskite absorber is methyl-ammonium lead tri-halides ( CH3NH3PbX3 ) with an optical bandgap ranging between 15 and 23 eV depending on the specific halide composition [ 7 ]  Recently  the experimental study of Sn doping on methyl-ammonium lead chloride perovskite is carried out for its photovoltaic performance enhancement [ 8 ]  Despite the ongoing pursuit of various research groups in the direction of improving the efficiencies of lead-based perovskite solar cells  a lot of efforts have also been devoted to find an alternative to lead for countering the challenges of toxicity which might otherwise hinder the widespread commercialization of this new technology [ 4 ]  Although a variety of divalent metals have been tested for the B-site in the perovskite composition  Tin ( Sn ) has been found to be the most successful in terms of delivering reasonably good efficiencies [ 9  10 ]  In addition to that  replacement of lead ( Pb ) with Sn results in achieving a bandgap of ~ 13 eV [ 2 ]  which is close to the ideal bandgap as postulated by the Shockley-Queisser limit [ 11 ]  When combined with a suitable wide bandgap perovskite sub-cell  such low bandgap Sn perovskites provide a pathway to fabricate high-efficiency all-perovskite tandem solar cells  However  besides the widely known problem of stability  such Sn based perovskites have also yet to achieve efficiencies comparable to their lead-based counterparts  Therefore  numerical study of the Sn based perovskites can be a more effective technique to trigger further developments in this field rather than going for extensive experimental investigations initially  In this work  a Tin ( Sn ) based perovskite material ( MASnI3 ) is sandwiched between p-doped NiO hole transporting material and n-doped PCBM ( phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester ) electron transporting material in a planar inverted configuration and the effects of thickness and doping concentration of various constituent layers on the device performance are studied using Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator ( SCAPS ) one-dimensional ( 1-D ) simulation program  The simulation methodology and architecture of the device is discussed in Sect  2 followed by results and discussion in Sect  3  Brief description of PSC with Cu2O as HTM & PCBM as ETM and inorganic PSC  Cesium Lead Iodide ( CsPbI3 ) is presented in Sect  4 and 5 respectively  Finally  the conclusion is drawn in Sect  6  2 Simulation methodology and device structure and its physics The proposed PSC as shown in Fig  1 is simulated with SCAPS 1-D simulation program  The simulation program is based on solving Poisson ’ s equation  carrier-continuity equation and drift diffusion equation for the charge carriers as mentioned in Eqs  ( 1 ) – ( 3 ) [ 12  13 ]  For various thin film solar cell technologies  the device performance is analyzed by using numerical methods ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) where φ is electric potential  ɛ is dielectric constant  q is electronic charge  n is electron concentration  p is hole concentration  Jn is electron current density  Jp is hole current density  G is carrier generation rate  R is carrier recombination rate  Dn is electron diffusion coefficient  Dp is hole diffusion coefficient  µn is electron mobility  and μp is hole mobility [ 14 ]  In this study  the simulated device stack for lead-free perovskite solar cell ( PSC ) is shown in Fig  1  Fig  1 figure 1 Stacked layers of perovskite solar cell for device simulation Full size image The symbols mentioned in the Table 1 represent their usual meanings  The proposed perovskite solar cell is an planar ( P-i-N ) type structure having ITO transparent conductive oxide as front contact followed by p-doped NiO  interface layer ( IL1 )  intrinsic type CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite material  interface layer ( IL2 )  n-doped PCBM layer and silver ( Ag ) back contact  The material parameters are taken from literatures are shown in Table 1  The capture cross-section of electrons and holes are considered to be 2 × 10−14 cm−2 with defect type “ neutral ” charge in both bulk and interface layers  The energetic distribution is Gaussian type and the reference for defect energy level Et is considered above Ei  The energy level with respect to reference is considered as 06 eV with characteristic energy at 01 eV  The total density of traps ( Nt ) uniformly considered in the perovskite materials and interface layers are 25 × 1013 cm−3 and 1 × 1017 cm−3 resulting diffusion length of carriers are 1 µm and 16 × 10−2 µm respectively  The electron and hole thermal velocities are kept constant ie  1 × 107 cm s−1 in all materials  Table 1 Simulation parameters of the lead free PSC with various layers [ 5  10  141516 ] Full size table 3 Results and discussion The J-V characteristics with the variation of perovskite layer thickness are plotted in Fig  2  It is observed that there is an increase of Voc  Jsc  FF and efficiency with increase in the thickness of perovskite layer and optimum values of Voc = 098 V  Jsc = 3486 mA/cm2  FF = 8564 % and efficiency ( eta ) = 2919 % are obtained at a thickness of 1000 nm  Fig  2 figure 2 The J–V characteristics with respect to the change of Perovskite Thickness Full size image This improvement in efficiencies is primarily ascribed to the greater absorption of sunlight in the near infrared region with increasing absorber thickness  thereby resulting in an increase in the photo generated current density [ 12 ]  It is observed from Fig  3 that within the wavelength range of 350–900 nm  the absorption and the external quantum efficiency is very high ( ideally 100 %  but in practice it is much lower due to several optical and electrical losses )  However  after 900 nm  the QE falls sharply till it reaches zero at 950 nm ( corresponding to the bandgap energy of 13 eV )  Fig  3 figure 3 The quantum efficiency of NiO/MASnI3/PCBM solar cell Full size image It is realized that with the change of NiO ( hole transport layer ) thickness and PCBM ( electron transport layer ) thickness from 10 nm to 50 nm there is a very small reduction of Voc  Jsc  FF and efficiency  Hence the optimum thickness of NiO and PCBM is kept at 10 nm  The doping concentration of a photoactive material in the solar cell architecture decides the electrical behavior of the layers which will affect the performance of the device [ 16 ]  In order to understand the doping effect on the device performance  the doping levels are varied and observed for both NiO and PCBM  With the variation of doping concentration from 1 × 1013 to 1 × 1019 in NiO hole transport material  it is observed from Table 2  that the PCE increases from 2217 to 2919 %  This increase in PCE primarily results from the rise in the conductivity of NiO  which thereby reduces the series resistance of the entire device  Hence  the optimum doping concentration is fixed to 1x1019  It is also visible in the table that Voc increases which is due to the decrease in the reverse saturation current with increase in doping concentration  Jsc increases slightly and because of the increase in the conductivity of the device  FF also increases as the doping concentration increases  Table 2 J-V characteristic parameters with the variation of dopant concentration in NiO ( hole transport material ) keeping PCBM concentration 1 × 1020 cm−3 Full size table Again  it is observed from Table 3  that PCE is also influenced by the variation of the doping concentration of PCBM electron transport material  The Jsc is constant which shows that Jsc is not related to the doping concentration of PCBM  With increase in doping concentration  the recombination rate also increases  So  both the Voc and FF are increasing initially and then Voc remains constant and FF started reducing from 1 × 1019  Similarly  PCE also increases with the increase in doping concentration and remains constant when the PCBM doping concentration reached to 1 × 1020 cm−2  Table 3 J-V characteristic parameters with the variation of dopant concentration in PCBM ( electron transport material ) keeping NiO concentration at 1 × 1019 cm−3 Full size table From Table 4  it is observed that the variation in the doping concentration of perovskite material also affects the overall device performance  The efficiency reaches the maximum of 2919 % when doping concentration is 1 × 1013 cm−3 and it sharply declines after 1 × 1019 cm−3 until it reaches the lowest value of 573 % at 1 × 1020 cm−3  It is because a heavily p-type doped material short-circuited a solar cell  and does not work as an effective absorber [ 9 ]  ( 4 ) Table 4 J-V characteristic parameters with the variation of dopant concentration in Perovskite material  keeping PCBM concentrations as 1 × 1020 cm−3 and NiO concentrations as 1 × 1019 cm−3 Full size table From the above equation  it is observed that Voc is a function of both Jsc and the reverse saturation current of the device ( Jo )  Jsc also depends on the thickness of the layer and thus  there is a variation in the open circuit voltage  Voc with change in layer thickness  In Fig  4  Jsc is increasing slowly from 3309 to 34771 mA/cm2 which is due to the increase in carrier generation  then remains almost constant when perovskite thickness is from 1000 to 1200 nm  FF is almost constant with the increase in perovskite layer thickness as shown in Fig  5  Fig  4 figure 4 Voc and Jsc with the variation of perovskite absorber layer thickness Full size image Fig  5 figure 5 FF and PCE with the variation of perovskite absorber layer thickness Full size image Because of the production of new charge carriers  the power conversion efficiency increases with increase in thickness  However  efficiency becomes almost constant from thickness 850 nm and started decreasing from 1050 nm since the recombination process increases and extraction rate of electron and hole pairs become lesser [ 17 ]  Finally  the optimized PCE of 2919 % is found when perovskite layer thickness is kept to be 1000 nm as shown in Fig  5  4 PSC with Cu2O as HTM and PCBM as ETM A highly efficient lead free perovskite solar cell based on CH3NH3SnI3 absorber material with Cu2O as HTM and PCBM as ETM is investigated [ 13 ]  The device is optimized using absorber thickness and doping concentrations of HTM  ETM and perovskite absorber which influence the device performance  The maximum value of PCE is obtained as 3059 % with Voc of 099 V  Jsc of 3513 mA/cm2 and FF of 8712 %  From these results it is expected that lead free perovskite solar cell can be a potential choice of achieving high efficiency and toxic free solar cell  5 Cesium lead iodide ( CsPbI3 ) PSC CsPbI3 is one of the promising inorganic halide perovskites for high stability  where Cesium ( Cs+ ) is used instead of organic perovskites such as methyl- ammonium or formamidinum  The volatile organic components induce thermal and chemical instability in hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites  In order to enhance the stability and photovoltaic performance  inorganic halide perovskite is obtained by substituting the volatile organic components with Cs+  In this work  a detailed theoretical investigation on the CsPbI3 based inorganic  i-PSCs is performed and the following photovoltaic performance parameters are obtained such as Voc of 14 V  Jsc of 1175 mA/cm2  FF of 8647 % and PCE of 1419 %  6 Conclusion A lead free  Sn based perovskite solar cell is proposed with NiO as HTM and PCBM as ETM resulting PCE above 29 %  Lead free PSC with Cu2O as HTM and PCBM as ETM delivered PCE above 30 %  Due to its high efficiency and low toxicity  the proposed PSC can be a replacement for the commonly used MAPbI3 based perovskite solar cell and used as a bottom sub-cell in an all perovskite tandem cell  However  it is noted that in practice  the morphology of perovskite film and its interface with charge transporting layers greatly influence the shunt resistance of the device ( not considered in this work ) may lower the device performance drastically  Nevertheless  this study provides an insight into the dependence of the device performance of Sn-based perovskite solar cell on the thickness  doping concentration of the absorber and the charge transporting layers  The in-organic  i-CsPbI3 PSCs can be explored for high stability and high PCEPerovskite light-emitting/detecting bifunctional fibres for wearable LiFi communication Article Open access Published : 16

compelling technology paradigm shifting the common means of high-capacity wireless communication technologies  requires wearable and full-duplex compact design because of its great significance in smart wearables as well as the ‘ Internet of Things ’  However  the construction of the key component of wearable full-duplex LiFi  light-emitting/detecting bifunctional fibres  is still challenging

devices for optical interactive display Article Open access 22 November 2022 Introduction A vast amount of data is generated every day in this information era  which has triggered the development of new high-speed wireless data communication technologies  such as the fifth generation of cellular systems ( 5 G ) and light fidelity ( LiFi )  This  combined with the emerging fields of the ‘ Internet of Things ’ ( IoT ) and big data  persistently pushes the miniaturization and densification of wireless communication terminals  In this context  the targeted design of wearable LiFi with the merits of portability  conformability  and safe and high-speed wireless communication will have boundless prospects in IoT terminals  Nevertheless  a typical LiFi system always consists of considerable quantities of transmitters ( LEDs ) and receivers ( PDs ) to meet the demand for high-capacity wireless communication and multiuser interaction  This definitely increases the complexity and volume of LiFi equipment  hindering the construction of wearable LiFi  The construction of full-duplex ( bilateral real-time communication capable ) wearable LiFi will be helpful for obtaining higher data rates and more portable IoT terminals1  Currently  rapid advances in material science and processing technology have made versatile wearables with functions such as health care  data transfer  energy storage  and military and fashion applications possible23456789  Therein  fibres have been proven to be excellent platforms for the construction of versatile functional devices91011121314151617 as well as carriers of receiver and emitter diodes in wearable optical communication systems4  In terms of the data transmission part in wearable LiFi  electroluminescent ( EL ) fibres based on inorganic phosphors18  organic materials1519  and polymers920 have already been reported  but they all have some shortcomings and are not suitable for the construction of wearable LiFi  For example  EL fibres based on inorganic phosphors require an alternating current ( AC ) field to create polarization currents to realise electroluminescence  and they suffer from inhomogeneous emission and a high operating voltage  which prevent them from being safely and conveniently integrated into textiles  Polymer light-emitting electrochemical cells usually have a slow turn-on process because of the p-i-n junction formation requiring time for the diffusion of mobile ions  which is not suitable for data transmission  The widely used thermal evaporation process in the fabrication of OLED fibres is costly  More importantly  a broad EL full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) is ubiquitous in the above devices  and the overlap of EL spectra between different EL devices will certainly bring about channel crosstalk in the operation of the LiFi system based on wavelength-division multiplexing technology  Apart from the demands for high luminescence quality and an inexpensive fabrication process  integrating the detection function into a single EL fibre is also necessary for wearable LiFi  Although light-emitting/detecting bifunctional devices have been realised on rigid substrates  including in double-heterojunction CdS/CdSe/ZnSe nanorod21  bilayer MoTe2 p–n junction22  and InGaN/Al010Ga090N multiple-quantum-well23 based devices  these device structures and materials are not suitable for wearable light-emitting/detecting bifunctional fibres  The construction of such bifunctional devices is still challenging because of the conflicting process between carrier separation and recombination as well as the highly dynamic film-forming process24 ; suitable materials and device structure are needed  Quantum dots ( QDs )  particularly metal halide perovskite QDs  have been extensively used for the construction of optoelectronic devices due to their excellent photoelectric properties252627282930  Considering the easily photogenerated charges of perovskite QDs and their easily adjustable ink components31  the challenge of the conflicting process between carrier separation and recombination  as well as the highly dynamic film-forming process for constructing light-emitting/detecting bifunctional fibres  can be handled  Here  we demonstrate a perovskite QD-based light-emitting/detecting bifunctional fibre obtained through a hybrid strategy and a facile  reproduceable solution assembly process  The hybrid perovskite inks improved the film-forming process  resulting in super-smooth QD films as well as successful fabrication of electroluminescent fibres  The green-emitting perovskite fibre has an FWHM of ~19 nm  which is the narrowest electroluminescence linewidth among all electroluminescent fibres  The emitting perovskite fibre can simultaneously receive information due to the small exciton binding energy and high carrier mobility of the perovskite QDs  The successful fabrication of narrow emission full-duplex LiFi fibres paves the way for the fabrication and integration of low crosstalk interoperable smart wearables  Results Fabrication of perovskite fibres The coaxial quantum dot light-emitting fibre ( QLEF ) was fabricated layer by layer through a typical dip-coating process  As shown in Fig  1a  a transparent PET fibre was used as the substrate for the construction of the coaxial structure flexible QLEF  The transparent electrodes and QD layer were subsequently dip-coated on the 03 μm diameter polyethylene terephthalate ( PET ) fibre  It is well known that both appropriate viscosity and surface tension of the solution are crucial for the construction of a high-quality electroluminescent ( EL ) layer in the dip-coating process  Generally  it is difficult to dip-coat homogeneous and smooth perovskite QD films via the regulation of the solvent and concentration  It is difficult to control the QD film-forming stage in the dip-coating process because the surface tension of QD ink is rather low  which usually makes QDs spread easily24  For a single-step dip-coating process  QDs typically form a network structure decorated by isolated islands of aggregated QDs ( Supplementary Fig  S1 )  For a multiple-step dip-coating process  the QD film usually has a large surface roughness  The heterogeneous structure will create a short-circuit current and joule heating under an electric field when applied as a luminous layer of EL devices  which will seriously deteriorate the luminance uniformity of EL fibres or even disable the EL fibre device  Herein  we propose a hybrid QD ink system  which consists of poly [ bis ( 4-phenyl ) ( 256-trimethylphenyl ) amine poly ( triarylamine ) ( PTAA )  135-tri [ ( 3-pyridyl ) -phen-3-yl ] benzene ( TmPyPB )  and perovskite QDs ( Fig  1b )  The green emission of pure QD ink changes to cyan after the addition of PTAA and TmPyPB under UV irradiation  Meanwhile  the emission peak of the perovskite QDs is slightly blue shifted ( Supplementary Fig  S2 )  which is probably because of the change in the average size of the self-assembled QDs in the organic matrix32  Fig  1 : Fabrication of LED-photodetector bifunctional multilayer perovskite fibres  figure 1 a

size image Figure 1c demonstrates AFM images of dip-coated films obtained by using the pure QD and hybrid QD inks under the same procedure  The as-prepared hybrid QD film exhibits a super-smooth surface with a roughness of 19 nm  while the film dip-coated with pure QDs has a rather rough surface with a roughness greater than 10 nm  This is further confirmed by the PL mapping results ( Supplementary Fig  S3 )  The fused NCs in the hybrid film and the possible coupling between QDs may also help improve the luminescent properties with the assistance of multiexciton resonances3334  We believe that the successful fabrication of this super-smooth film is probably due to the improved film-forming process of the hybrid QD ink  Figure 1d illustrates a typical dip-coating process  In brief  the fibre is first dipped into and wetted by the QD ink  followed by the vertical withdrawal process  In the film-forming process in dip-coating  the film thickness is controlled by the coefficient of the gravity force ( G )  viscous drag ( Fv ) and liquid-vapour surface tension ( γ ) 2435  Typically  the dip-coating process can be divided into the transition stage and solidified stage  Draining and evaporation of the solvent accompany the balance between the QD efflux and influx below the liquid−gas−solid three-phase contact line in the transition stage  Usually  solvent evaporation often results in many pores in the compliant film  The pore-containing structure collapses in the solidified stage due to the effect of the capillary force ( Fcp )  which is proportional to the surface tension and viscosity of the ink  Inevitably  the viscosity and surface tension of hybrid QD inks are increased after the addition of organic components ( Supplementary Fig  S4 and Table 1 )  which creates a greater Fcp  thereby forming a super-smooth film through a cooperative effect of the gravity force  viscous drag and liquid-vapour surface tension  In addition  the gap-filling effect of small molecules and polymers in QD inks also contributes to a super-smooth film38  In contrast  the rough film dip-coated using pure QD inks was probably caused by aggregation of QDs  thermal expansion and solvent evaporation during the multiple dip-coating and thermal treatment processes  As a result  dip-coated fibres with homogeneous photoluminescence can be obtained  As shown in Fig  1e  the perovskite fibres can be arranged into an ‘ NUST ’ pattern and exhibit homogeneous PL properties  In addition  such a composite strategy can be extended to various kinds of substrates  such as Ag wire and Zn wire  The bright and uniform photoluminescence under UV light is shown in the insert of Fig  1e  The photoluminescent perovskite fibres can also be assembled into luminous textiles ( Fig  1f ) as well as one fibre to achieve multicolour woven structures ( Fig  1g )  showing great potential for the fabrication of perovskite EL fibres  Table 1 Comparison of the FWHM of reported fibre-shaped electroluminescent devices  Full size table Discussion Electroluminescence properties of the perovskite fibres As shown in Fig  2a  the device structure of EL fibres was designed according to the typical planar device structure  PTAA  TPBi  and Liq/Al were selected as the hole transport layer ( HTL )  electron transport layer ( ETL )  and cathode  respectively  PEDOT : PSS ( Clevios PH1000 ) was used as a high conductivity transparent anode  As shown in Fig  2a  the structure of the perovskite EL fibre was further characterized by a FIB-SEM system  The as-prepared perovskite fibre consists of ~150 nm PEDOT : PSS and PTAA as the HTL  a 65 nm thick QD layer ( estimated by the thickness of the hybrid QD film ) as the emitting layer  50 nm TPBi as the ETL  and 3 nm Liq and 100 nm Al as the cathode  For a fibre-shaped device  the sheet resistance of the anode seriously affects the luminance uniformity  Herein  a multi-dip-coating process is adopted for anode fabrication  and the square resistance decreases with increasing dip-coating steps ( Supplementary Fig  S5 )  The as-prepared PEDOT : PSS film is compact ( Supplementary Fig  S6 ) and has a surface roughness of 157 nm ( Supplementary Fig  S7 )  Due to the appropriate capillary force in the film-forming stage  uniform and bright electroluminescence can be easily realised  The current density-voltage-luminance curves of the perovskite EL fibres are shown in Fig  2c  The QLEF still shows a considerable luminance of ~100 cd m−2 at 7 V after being bent dozens of times ( Fig  2c )  and the corresponding current efficiency is 167 cd A−1 ( Supplementary Fig  S8 )  It is well known that perovskite QDs are outstanding luminance materials for next-generation high-definition displays due to their high defect tolerance  quantum efficiency and narrow FWHM  By applying perovskite QDs as emitting materials in the electroluminescent fibre  the green electroluminescence perovskite fibre presents a narrow FWHM of 19 nm with chromaticity coordinates of ( 009076 ) ( Fig  2d )  which is the narrowest FWHM among all the reported fibre-shaped electroluminescent devices ( Supplementary Table S1 )  As shown in the insert of Fig  2d  the operating electroluminescent perovskite fibre shows uniform and bright green emission at 7 V The QLEF fibres can also be easily woven into an ‘ N ’ pattern ( Supplementary Fig  S9 )  showing great capability for wearable displays  Red fibres with uniform electroluminescence are also achieved by using the same composite strategy and exhibit chromaticity coordinates of ( 065027 ) ( Fig  2e )  The electroluminescent perovskite fibre can also be being bent to a bending radius of 45 mm during operation ( Fig  2f )  In addition  the perovskite fibres can be wrapped around a pencil ( Supplementary Fig  S10 ) and exhibit the potential to be used as decoration  The resulting fibres can also be woven into a glove and a sweater ( Supplementary Figs  S11 and S12 )  When used as a fibre-shaped electroluminescent device  inherent merits  such as a wide viewing angle and no extra absorbing losses  also exist for the proposed perovskite  as shown in Supplementary Fig  S13  Fig  2 : Electroluminescence function of the perovskite fibres  figure 2 a Schematic illustration of the working mechanism ( LED mode ) of the

and a bent fibre in operation  Full size image Photodetection properties of the perovskite fibres Apart from the fine electroluminescence quality of the perovskite fibres  their photoresponse capability was surprising  The energy band diagram of the proposed perovskite electroluminescent fibre is proposed in Fig  3a  indicating that the fibre is capable of photodetection  As shown in Fig  3b  a photocurrent arises from direct green laser ( 515 nm  683 mW ) irradiation in single detection mode at a rather small bias  The current varies significantly from dark to light conditions between −2 V and 25 V biases ( Fig  3b )  In the insert of Fig  3b  the I–V plot around zero bias is amplified  which shows that the QLEF can be self-powered  with a photocurrent response at zero bias  The self-powered property can be attributed to the band curvature in the space charge region induced by the Fermi level difference between the perovskite and the surrounding materials  The accompanying built-in field drives the charge separation process and gives rise to the photocurrent at zero bias  The I-T curves of the perovskite fibre under different bias conditions are shown in Fig  3c  The Ilight/Idark ratio of the QLEF is estimated to be ~15 under zero bias  The responsivity of the QLEF is calculated to be 186 × 10−3 mA W−1 at a −2 V bias and 315 × 10−3 mA W−1 at a 25 V bias under 515 nm illumination  The corresponding external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of the QLEF in PD mode is calculated to be 045 × 10−3 % and 076 × 10−3 %  respectively  Such a mediocre performance might result from the insufficient thickness of the active layer and could be further optimised by increasing the light capture  optimising the device structure  and improving the film quality of the active layer and contact between interfaces  In addition  the perovskite fibre has a photoresponse ability under illumination by 10 kHz square-wave modulated LD signals at a 0 V bias ( Supplementary Fig  S14 )  Interestingly  the current also varies significantly at a forward bias of approximately 2 V  which shows potential for the construction of light-emitting/detecting bifunctional devices  Fig  3 : Photodetection function of the perovskite fibres  figure 3 a Schematic illustration of the working mechanism ( PD mode ) of the light-emitting/detecting bifunctional perovskite fibre  b Photocurrent

For a light communication system  bilateral real-time data transmission between the transmitting terminal and receiving terminal is one of the most critical issues  For wearable displays consisting of fabrics  a wide viewing angle of light-emitting fibres could satisfy the demand for multiangle data transmission  However  there are hardly any demonstrations of simultaneous data acquisition and data transmission through a single fibre  Therefore  a bifunctional fibre with both light emitting and photoresponse abilities is essential for bilateral real-time data transport and is the foundation of wearable fibre-to-fibre communication  Figure 4a demonstrates a wearable LiFi system based on the perovskite bifunctional fibres  Clearly  there are two transceivers in the system : the transceiver on the left represents the mobile wearable terminal ( MWT ) based on the perovskite bifunctional fibres ; the other transceiver represents the terminal that the MWT interacts with  which consists of a commercial photodiode and a laser as a signal receiver ( RX ) and a transmitter ( TX )  respectively  A signal generator is used to generate different waveforms ( first set of signals : voltage signal applied on the fibre ; second set of signals : voltage signal applied on the commercial laser that induces the photoresponse of the fibre ) to distinguish the detected signal and transmitted signals of the bifunctional fibres  Fig  4 : Demonstration of a wearable LiFi system based on the perovskite bifunctional fibres  figure 4 a Schematic illustration of the full-duplex fibre-based wearable LiFi system based on the light-emitting/detecting bifunctional perovskite fibre  The transceiver on the left represents the mobile wearable terminal ( MWT ) based on the perovskite bifunctional fibres ; the other transceiver represents the terminal that the MWT interacts with  which consists of a commercial photodiode ( PD ) and a laser diode ( LD ) as the receiver ( RX ) and transmitter ( TX )  respectively  Two sets of signals are used to test the capability of simultaneously transmitting and receiving information  Signal 1 ( sine wave ) is applied on the fibre to transmit data ; Signal 2 ( square wave ) is applied on the LD to provide the incoming data that the fibre needs to identify  A superimposed signal that contains the information of the abovementioned two sets of signals is acquired by an oscilloscope  which is clearly distinguishable  Full size image Based on the above demands for a wearable LiFi system  we investigated the full-duplex LiFi properties of the as-prepared bifunctional fibres  The capability for data transmission was first investigated  The perovskite fibre functions as the transmitter and is directly driven by the alternating applied voltage generated by an arbitrary waveform generator  As shown in the middle of Fig  5a  a peak-to-peak voltage of 400 mV and offset voltage of 72 V PRBS signal is adopted to modulate the voltage-related light-emission intensity  which contains data information  As shown at the top of Fig  5a  the fibre shows different EL intensities and brightnesses under the modulated voltage signal  The modulated light containing data information is then received by the photodetector of the transceiver that the MWT interacts with  Afterwards  the photocurrent signals are amplified and exported to the oscilloscope ( the bottom of Fig  5a )  If we assess the brighter light signals as the ‘ 1 ’ level and less bright light signals as the ‘ 0 ’ level  then we can clearly distinguish the 0 and 1 from the signal received by the photodetector that the transceiver MWT interacts with  Fig  5 : Full-duplex characteristics of the bifunctional fibre LiFi  figure 5 a Illustration of the light intensity-related data transmission

eye diagram of the 50 kbit s−1 data rate clearly shows an open eye ( Fig  4c )  which demonstrates the ability to transfer audio signals  An audio communication system can be easily constructed through acoustoelectric and photoelectric signal transformation with the help of external circuits ( Supplementary Fig  S15 ) 23  However  it is difficult for the unencapsulated fibre to stick to the whole audio transfer process  Despite the mediocre data rate that one QLEF has  the integration of fibres in wearable fabric will remarkably boost the data rate  which shows that QLEFs and fabrics based on them are very suitable platforms for data transmission  Another necessary characteristic for the bifunctional fibre used in a wearable LiFi system is the photoresponse capacity at a forward bias that can drive EL emission  which was subsequently evaluated  Figure 5c shows transient photoresponse signals generated by the perovskite fibre at a forward bias of 7 V when the QLEF was irradiated by a 405 nm laser pulse driven at a 10 kHz frequency  The response and recovery processes are distinct and distinguishable  In addition  the response and recovery times are estimated to be 5 and 6 μs ( defined as the time interval for the values to reach 90 % and decrease to 10 % of the maximum amplitude  respectively )  Notably  the response time and recovery times are comparable to those of outstanding fibre-shaped perovskite photodetectors and are also sufficient for text and audio transmission in optical communication systems3940  As illustrated in Fig  4a  we further use two sets of signals to demonstrate the simultaneously occurring data transmission and acquisition processes  First  the 405 nm LD driven by the square wave signal is used to irradiate the QLEF ( top of Fig  5d )  and the 100 Hz sine wave signal is applied on the QLEF to simulate the data transmission signal ( bottom of Fig  5d )  As shown in the middle of Fig  5d  the superimposed signal consists of two signals : the detected signal ( data acquisition ) and the transmitted signal ( data transmission ) of the fibre-based MWT  The superimposed signals can be extracted through a self-interference cancellation method  The simple binary data ‘ 1 ’ and ‘ 0 ’ are distinct  and data segments are well restored in the superimposed signal  The successful demonstration of bifunctional fibres verified the feasibility of a wearable full-duplex LiFi system based on EL-PD bifunctional perovskite fibres  Furthermore  both the electroluminescence and photodetection performance should be improved to realize bilateral real-time data transport between two fibres that belong to different interoperable LiFi terminals  In addition  different functions  such as biosensing  force sensing or other functions that are integrated into a single fibre or textiles  are also promising for future smart wearables  In summary  we demonstrate wearable and colour tuneable perovskite light-emitting/detecting bifunctional fibres based on a hybrid strategy  The hybrid perovskite ink endows fibres with super-smooth QD films  This  combined with the small exciton binding energy and high carrier mobility of the perovskite QDs  enables the successful integration of electroluminescence and photodetection into a single fibre  The bifunctional fibres possess the narrowest luminescence spectrum of ~19 nm and  more importantly  the capability for simultaneously transmitting and receiving information  The successful fabrication of narrow emission full-duplex LiFi fibres paves the way for the fabrication and integration of low crosstalk interoperable smart wearables  Materials and methods Synthesis of perovskite NCs The synthesis of perovskite NCs follows the reported

Perovskite solar cells ( PVSCs ) have kept the photovoltaic research community on a fast track to the Shockley–Queisser limit12 most recently  with a certified power-conversion efficiency ( PCE ) reaching 252 %  In 2009  Miyasaka and coworkers pioneered a PCE of 38 % with a liquid electrolyte3 Just three years later  solid-state PVSCs were reported with a PCE of 10 %  triggering the photovoltaic ( PV ) tsunami that has lasted until today45 The record for the current PCE perovskite solar cell has already surpassed that for multicrystalline silicon solar cells ( 223 % ) and is approaching that for single-crystal silicon solar cells ( 261 % )  The success of PVSCs is mainly attributed to the superior photovoltaic properties of the perovskite materials  such as a large absorption coefficient  suitable bandgap  good defect tolerance  and fast carrier transport6–8 In this article  we summarize the recent progress in post-treatment techniques for perovskite film growth  We start by introducing the early technical developments and the bottlenecks of perovskite solar cells  mainly the nonradiative recombination channels  These are followed by a review of post-treatment techniques  which are highly effective in mitigating the nonradiative recombination  followed by a forward-looking outlook of this field  Technical developments and bottleneck analysis A solid-state PVSC typically consists of a perovskite active layer  a hole-transport layer ( HTL )  an electron-transport layer ( ETL )  and current collecting electrodes ( Figure 1a )  The perovskite layer is the most important one  and thus has attracted much research effort  The development of fabrication methods and composition engineering have contributed greatly to this area  Figure 1 figure 1 ( a ) The general architecture of perovskite solar cells ( PVSCs )  At least one of the electrodes should be transparent for light incidence  ( b ) The power-conversion efficiency ( PCE ) triangle ( open-circuit voltage  short-circuit current density  and fill factor ) of PVSCs collating the theoretical PCE parameters with a 147 eV bandgap ( green )  The inner blue triangle presents the actual parameters that have currently been achieved by composition engineering and fabrication method development  The post-treatment techniques enlarged the PCE triangle ( yellow ) with an improved fill factor ( 081 ) and open-circuit voltage ( 118V ) 142021 Full size image The sequential deposition method  consisting of PbI2 deposition first  followed by soaking in methylammonium iodide ( MAI ) solution to obtain MAPbI39 allows the perovskite to easily penetrate into the mesopores of a TiO2 ETL  while the one-step method uses chloride ions to modulate the perovskite formation dynamics  yielding films with few pinholes10 Despite the much larger grain size of perovskites fabricated by the one-step method  pinholes still exist  leading to current leakage and PV performance decay  The vapor deposition method operating in a vacuum5 on the other hand  can achieve high open-circuit voltage ( Voc )  albeit with large hysteresis  These methods overall improved film quality  reduced bulk recombination  and lowered the current leakage  pushing the PCE of PVSCs to ~14 % in the early development  In 2014  the antisolvent dripping method came onto the scene  This method employs a volatile solvent such as toluene to expedite solvent extraction and film drying during the spin-coating process  The resultant compact and smooth perovskite films with large  uniform  and densely stacked grains enabled the PVSCs to reach a record PCE of 162 % 11 This method was quickly accepted by researchers  rapidly pushing the PCE to more than 21 % 12 In recent years  modified sequential deposition methods have been developed and have begun to show their advantage in the fabrication of high-efficiency perovskite solar cells by pushing the PCE up to more than 23 % 1314 Much of the theme underlying the development of fabrication methods lies in the reduction of bulk defects and pinholes  Composition engineering is an equally exciting frontier  At the initial stage  most research focused on the MAPbI3 perovskite  which has a bandgap of ~156 eV and a tetragonal crystal structure  This bandgap is not optimal ( ~134 eV ) for achieving the theoretical PCE limit15 Moreover  the tetragonal phase is unstable due to lattice distortion and a serious ion migration problem  Replacing a methylamine ( MA ) ion with a formamidine ( FA ) ion is a big step forward6 and the resulting FAPbI3 perovskite has a bandgap of ~147 eV and a more symmetric cubic crystal structure  lending it higher light utilization and higher stability  However  the black α-FAPbI3  which is a viable absorber in solar cells  is less stable than the yellow δ-FAPbI3 ( a nonabsorber in solar cells ) with a face-sharing  linear chain structure of linked [ PbI6 ] octahedra  The composition engineering effort in 2015 helped settle this phase instability problem  It turns out that a mixed composition  ( FAPbI3 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015  could maintain the black phase yielding a PCE of 18 % 16 Researchers could now synthesize stable FA1−xMAxPbI3  perovskites with even smaller bandgaps14 The stability was further improved by expanding the pool of A-site cations to the large group IA cations  such as Cs+ and Rb+ and of the X-site anions to Br−1718 For example  a small portion of Cs+ ( 5 % ) in MA017FA083Pb108 ( I083Br017 ) 3 perovskite could improve the device stability from less than 10h to more than 250h ( max power point tracking under continuous illumination )  Notably  Cs ( 181Å ) is smaller than FA ( 279Å ) and MA ( 270Å )  and this helps to effectively maintain the black phase of the perovskite  On the other hand  composition engineering adjusts the bandgap of perovskite from 12 eV to 31 eV and changes the structure dimension from 3D to 0D19 Today  the short-circuit current density ( Jsc ) of PVSCs has reached 267mA/cm2  which is 924 % of the theoretical maximum Jsc ( 289mA/cm2 ) for an absorber with a 147 eV bandgap20 ( Figure 1b )  The Voc could reach 118V  which is 944 % of the Shockley–Queisser limit Voc ( 125V ) 14 The fill factor ( FF ) could reach ~081  which is 89 % of the Shockley-Queisser limit FF ( 091 ) 21 Among the three previously discussed parameters  Jsc is mainly limited by light absorption  as the internal quantum efficiency ( IQE ) is almost 100 % 2223 and Voc and FF are all highly affected by the nonradiative recombinations in PVSCs  To further push the PCE  the origins of nonradiative recombination should be systematically studied and carefully controlled  Nonradiative energy loss in perovskite solar cells On the way to the thermodynamic limit of the PVSC ’ s PCE  a close to theoretical Jsc has been achieved by exhausting the capacity of the fabrication method development and composition engineering strategies to enhance light utilization  Low Voc and FF due to nonradiative energy loss still have much room for improvement ; 814 this is where the post-treatment techniques can play a significant role  Theoretically  the nonradiative energy loss of PVSCs has several major sources : the bulk defects-mediated nonradiative recombination ; the interfacial-defects mediated nonradiative recombination ; and the band mismatch induced energy loss at the interface2425 Bulk defects in perovskites are mainly dislocations/distortion at grain boundaries  vacancies  interstitials  antisites  and impurities ( Figure 2a )  As a large number of grain boundaries exist in polycrystalline perovskite films  their influence on the recombination rate is significant in PVSCs  The calculation results showed that grain boundaries do not generate isolated gap states  but enhance electron–phonon coupling to accelerate electron–hole recombination in perovskites  which seriously deteriorates the carrier lifetime726 Vacancies are one of the major intrinsic defects in perovskites with a low formation_energy  Fortunately  most of the vacancies are shallow traps  which have little contribution to recombination  However  vacancies can exacerbate ion migration and  consequently  the degradation of materials and device performance  In contrast  the interstitials and antisites could create deep traps  which act as pronounced recombination centers to compensate light-activated carriers24 The impurities also seriously deteriorate the efficiency of PVSCs  which may come from the reagents  solvents  and ion migration process27 The grain boundaries  interstitials  and anti-sites need to be carefully suppressed to further improve the PVSC ’ s performance  Figure 2 figure 2 Nonradiative energy-loss channels of ( a )

type ( f )  The ideal type suffers the least energy loss owing to the absence of a barrier to interfacial hole transfer  Note : CB  conduction band ; HTL  hole-transport layer  Full size image Interfacial nonradiative recombination is a type of electron–hole interaction at the heterointerfaces in PVSCs  For a typical device  there are four kinds of heterointerfaces : the ETL/electrode  perovskite/ETL  HTL/perovskite  and electrode/HTL ( Figure 1a )  In general  the recombination process is determined by the interfacial energy states  which are influenced by the crystallinity  orientation  and atomic bonding at and surrounding the interface  It is obvious that each interface has its own unique recombination property due to the different atomic structures of the material pairs  which makes the recombination behavior much more complex than the bulk defect-mediated recombination ( Figure 2b–c )  Taking the MAPbI3/TiO2 interface as a typical example  the oxygen atoms are on the exposed ( 101 ) slab and titanium atoms are exposed below the oxygen atoms  One possible interfacial atomic structure is the I–Ti bonding between MAPbI3 and TiO2  and the other is the Pb–O bonding  These different interfacial atomic structures inevitably beget different interfacial energy states and defects  giving rise to different interfacial recombination behaviors28 For the previously discussed two kinds of energy-loss routes  exited electrons and holes recombine at the intraband states  created by the bulk defects or the atomic interaction at the heterointerfaces  The energy-band mismatch is the unfavorable band alignment feature at interfaces in PVSCs  At the heterojunctions  electrons or holes will transport from one side to the other side to reach the same Fermi level  Thus  a given energy band will bend according to the electron–hole transport  which will induce electron–hole accumulation at the interface and thus change their recombination and transport behaviors  During the PVSCs operation under illumination  the Fermi level in a perovskite splits into two quasi Fermi levels  Taking the HTL/perovskite interface as an example  the quasi Fermi level ( hole ) of perovskite layer and Fermi level of HTL layer should be evenly aligned  Thus  the interfacial band alignment has three representative types  1  The ideal type : The valence band ( VB ) is flat at the interface and the conduction band ( CB ) is interrupted ( Figure 2d )  In this case  the holes could transport to the electrode with minimum energy loss and electrons will be effectively blocked29 2  The straddling type : The electron will transport from the perovskite side to the HTL side to align the Fermi level with a straddling type band bending ( Figure 2e )  In this case  the holes can not effectively transport from perovskite to HTL and will accumulate at the perovskite side to increase its concentration  3  The staggered type : The electron will transport from the HTL side to the perovskite side to align the Fermi level with a staggered-type band bending ( Figure 2f )  In this case  the holes will lose their free energy when transported from the perovskite to HTL and accumulate at the HTL side to increase its concentration30 The band mismatch-caused energy loss is due to the carrier recombination or the free energy loss  The nonradiative recombination part is described by:31 { j_ { text { s } } }   =   eSn_ { text { p } } ^ { text { x } }   times   frac { { Delta { E_F } } } { { { e^ { { k_B } T } } } }  ( 1 ) where js is the surface recombination current ; e is the unit ( electron ) charge ; S is the surface recombination velocity ; n_ { text { p } } ^ { text { x } } is the electron density at the hole contact in thermal equilibrium ; ΔEF is the quasi Fermi level splitting ; kB is the Boltzmann constant ; and T is the temperature  From this equation  we can derive that the surface recombination current of the straddling type and the staggered type is larger than the ideal type  with more energy loss  Taking the straddling type as an example  the holes should get enough energy to cross the energy barrier and then lose free energy as the VB drops in HTL  According to recent literature reports  PVSCs with PEDOT : PSS HTL always showed Voc around 1V  whereas PVSCs with poly ( triaryl amine ) ( PTAA ) HTL show Voc greater than 11V29 This Voc gap is mainly caused by the larger band mismatch between PEDOT : PSS and perovskite than that between PTAA and perovskite  As for the staggered type  the situation is similar to that of the straddling type in that the holes also need to expend extra energy to cross the barrier with free energy loss as the VB drops at the interface  Taken together  to minimize the energy loss at the interface  we must reduce the interfacial trap density and design an ideal flat band across the perovskite layer and the carrier-transport layer  The optimization of fabrication methods and composition engineering strategies is approaching the ceiling for improving the efficiency of PVSCs  To further reduce the previously mentioned nonradiative recombination pathways  the post-treatment techniques as a simple “ add-on ” processing step must play a big role  These techniques can work on well-made perovskite films  and will be especially effective in optimizing the interfaces and grain boundaries  Post-treatment techniques for optimizing heterointerfaces Various effective post-treatment techniques have been reported to reduce the interfacial recombination  which could passivate the interfacial trap states  adjust the interfacial band offset  and improve the stability  Preliminary work showed that a two-dimensional ( 2D ) –three-dimensional ( 3D ) ( MAPbI3-PEA2PbI4 ) graded perovskite interface could form a gradient band structure at the perovskite–ETL interface32 As the quasi-Fermi level of an electron inside the perovskite is lower than the Fermi level of [ 66 ] -phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM )  a straddling type band alignment will form at the interface  which causes energy loss as previously discussed33 In the 2D–3D perovskite interface  the larger bandgap of PEA2PbI4 than that of MAPbI3 has determined that the CB at the interface is higher than the CB inside the perovskite bulk  which reduces the band mismatch between MAPbI3 and PCBM ( Figure 3a )  As a result  the interfacial recombination is largely suppressed  and the Voc of PVSCs increases from 110V to 117V In addition  as the 2D perovskite avoids the influence of water vapor and prohibits the migration iodide ions from MAPbI3 to silver electrode  the device stability is improved in addition to the efficiency ( Figure 3b )  Figure 3 figure 3 Post-treatment techniques for interfaces of perovskite solar cells  ( a ) The band structure of 2D–3D ( MAPbl3–PEA2Pbl4 ) -graded perovskite interface32 ( b ) Schematic illustration of PEA+ prohibiting the h ion migration from

transmission electron microscope image of the perovskite/lead sulfate/C60 interface39 Full size image Soon after  this type of strategy was widely used to improve the PVSC ’ s efficiency  In one case  10 mM n-hexyl trimethylammonium bromide ( HTAB ) solution in mixed solvent ( 0-dichlorobenzene : isopropanol=97:3v/v ) was spin-coated on the perovskite film to form a wide bandgap ( 26eV ) halide capping layer34 In addition to improved stability  this layer improves the Voc of PVSCs from ~09V to ~115V with a high PCE of 233 %  while Jsc does not decrease  Moreover  FF could also increase  as the HTAB perovskite leads to the self-assembly of poly ( 3-hexylthiophene-25-diyl ) ( P3HT ) and facilitates the interfacial charge transfer from P3HT to perovskite  Apart from HTAB  the 5-ammoniumvaleric acid iodide ( 5-AVAI ) in isopropanol ( IPA ) solution could also be spincoated on the ( FAPbI3 ) 088 ( CsPbBr3 ) 012 perovskite film to form the ( 5-AVA ) 2PbI4 capping layer35 As a result  the PVSC ’ s efficiency improved from 1372 % to 1675 %  Apart from the efficiency enhancement  this ( 5-AVA ) 2PbI4 capping layer also greatly improved the perovskite ’ s stability toward humidity  The perovskite film with this capping layer remained unchanged after 21 days under ~85 % RH  while the pristine film totally degraded  Other large-size ammonium salts could also be used to form a capping layer on the perovskite  such as tert-butylammonium iodide ( t-BAI ) or phenethylammonium bromide ( PEABr ) 36 In general  solutions of ammonium salts were spin-coated on the perovskite films as a post-treatment process  These kinds of strategies have one unique advantage : the lattice mismatch between capping wide bandgap perovskite and bulk small bandgap perovskite should be less than most passivation materials  which introduces fewer defects at the interface  Ammonium salts could also modify the interface by themselves  when not reacting with the 3D pristine perovskites  The phenethylammonium iodide ( PEAI ) in IPA solution was spin-coated on the FA1−xMAxPbI3 perovskite carefully to prevent its conversion to PEA2PbI4  which forms a PEAI passivating layer on the perovskite surface14 The PEAI is believed to fill the iodide vacancies at the surface of the perovskite layer  whose vacancies would serve as recombination centers at the interface  The passivated PVSC showed a significantly increased Voc of 118V  which is 944 % of the Shockley-Queisser limit Voc  Thus  the PVSC could reach a certified efficiency of 2332 %  Post-treatment techniques are also effective in inorganic perovskites  For example  the choline iodine ( CHI ) in an IPA solution was spin-coated on the β-CsPbI3 perovskite  which could homogeneously distribute on the perovskite ’ s surface and pinholes37 This CHI layer could draw down the perovskite ’ s CB and VB to better align with the HTL  The modified PVSC showed a significantly increased Voc of 111V and FF of 082  with certified PCE of 184 %  In another case  the 4-bromobenzylamine hydriodate ( BrBeAI ) in IPA solution was also spin-coated on the CsPbI2Br perovskite  which was gradually distributed on the surface and near surface bulk38 Different from CHI  BrBeAI could increase the VB and CB of a perovskite  leading to a comprehensive increase of Voc  Jsc  and FF  Moreover  BrBeAI is hydrophobic and could improve the water resistivity of the inorganic perovskite  which maintained its photoactive phase in 60 % relative humidity  As the band structure of different perovskites varies  the post-treatment techniques should be adjusted to meet the requirements of a specific interface  In this type of post-treatment  the ammonium salts are often ionconducting  which exhibits low conductivity  Thus  the solution concentration for post-treatment is always low ( ~1 mg/mL ) to form a sufficiently thin layer at the interfaces  Other reaction types could also be effective for the post-treatment techniques  In one study  an ultrathin PbSO4 layer ( ~3 nm ) was formed by immersing Cs005FA081MA014PbI255Br045 into ( C8H17NH3 ) 2SO4 solution ( Figure 3c–d ) 39 PbSO4 is highly compact and resistive to water and oxygen  which significantly improved the stability of the PVSCs  At the same time  the sulfate anions at the interface could effectively passivate the defect states  With a defect density of PbSO4  passivated PVSC is only 10 % that of the control device  In another case  PVSCs with carbon electrodes  cesium acetate ( CsAc ) in IPA solution was spin-coated on MAPbI3 with carbon  which formed a MA1−xCsxPbI3 top layer with a higher CB and VB than those of bulk MAPbI340 Meanwhile  as CsAc could partially dissolve the perovskite  the liquid-phase intermediates from the perovskites penetrated into the carbon electrodes and thus established better contact between carbon and perovskite than that with the simply printed carbon without CsAc treatment  Owing to the previously discussed effect  the Voc and Jsc of carbon electrode-based PVSC improved with a PCE of 156 % 40 Post-treatment techniques for perfecting grain boundaries The nonradiative recombination induced by defects at grain boundaries is another major recombination route in PVSCs  as previously discussed  Various post-treatment techniques could effectively reduce the grain-boundary number  which directly reduces the defect density and thus the nonradiation recombination possibility ( Figure 4a ) 41 Figure 4 figure 4 ( a ) Schematic illustration of perovskite grain growth induced by post-treatments  Top view scanning electron microscope images of ( b ) MAPbl3 and ( c ) MABr-treated MAPbl3 films  The after-treatment perovskite layer has a significantly larger grain size than the pristine one41 Full size image A smaller number of grain boundaries means a larger grain size in a perovskite film  In groundbreaking work  perovskite grains were significantly enlarged by a solvent annealing post-treatment  that is  annealing the MAPbI3 perovskite film in N  N-dimethylformamide ( DMF ) or dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) vapor42 The perovskite ’ s grains could grow at a much higher speed in a solvent vapor environment than in an inert environment  and thus reach a size twice as large as in an inert environment  This post-treatment could significantly reduce the defect density of the perovskite and improve device efficiency  In another study  the antisolvent chloroform ( CF ) was also shown to help perovskite grains grow bigger43 CF steam was used to fumigate CsPbBr3 after spin-coating  which increased the grain size from ~500 nm to ~3 μm  The H2O in a chlorobenzene-mixed solution could also assist grain growth of the perovskite44 A solution of 1 % H2O in chlorobenzene was dropped on a spinning solid MAPbI3 film  which enlarged the perovskite grain size to more than 1 μm  With the big grains  the PVSC showed a relatively high PCE of 21 % with an ultrahigh FF of 08644 The solvent  antisolvent  and their mixture all assist in the perovskite ’ s grain growth  However  the underlying principle of the effect of solvent and antisolvent on the grain growth of perovskites is still unclear  The most reliable explanation is that those compounds could help perovskites form intermediates at the grain boundaries and increase the grain-boundary migration speed  For example  DMSO vapor could react with MAPbI3 to establish a cycle of formation and decomposition of the MA2Pb3I8 ( DMSO ) 2 intermediate at grain boundaries  and thus reduce the grain-boundary migration activation energy45 Thus  grain-boundary migration speed increases and results in larger grains than those annealed in the inert atmosphere  Ammonium salts also promote perovskite grain growth  Zhao and co-workers reported that when methylammonium bromide ( MABr ) in an IPA solution was used to wash a spinning MAPbI3 perovskite film  this enlarged its grain size from ~200 nm to more than 1 μm ( Figure 4b–c ) 41 At the same time  the Br ion in MABr substituted the I− ion in the perovskite  which broadened its bandgap and increased the PVSC ’ s Voc  The PCE of PVSCs with MABr treatment is 174 %  which is much higher than the 147 % of pristine PVSCs  Additionally  the ( FA095PbI295 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015 perovskites were post-treated by guanidinium iodide/bromide/chloride ( Gual/GuaBr/GuaCl ) and formamidinium iodide/bromide/chloride ( FAI/FABr/FACl ) in IPA solution ; the GuaBr-treated PVSCs showed the best performance with a Voc of 120 V and certified efficiency of 2090 % due to the enlarged grains and reduced trap density46 Other types of ammonium salts are also effective for enlarging the grain size and for tuning the composition of perovskite thin films  such as guanidinium thiocyanate ( GuaSCN )  methylammonium chloride ( MACl )  and formamidinium boron hexafluoride ( FAPF6 ) 47–49 These ammonium salts enable Ostwald ripening inside perovskite polycrystalline films and substitute the X or A sites of ABX3  Taken together  this kind of post-treatment is multifunctional and powerful to improve the PVSC efficiency  Summary and outlook This article discussed the fundamentals of nonradiative energy loss in PVSCs at the current level of understanding  and reviewed recent advances in mitigating the energy loss by post-treatment techniques  If past research on perovskite solar cells is any indication  defect engineering and passivation will continue to make great advances  Bulk defectsmediated nonradiative recombination can be suppressed by post-treatments of grain boundaries  such as solvent/antisolvent and ammonium salts treatments  Interfacial defects-mediated nonradiative recombination and the band mismatch induced energy loss can be quelled by post-treatments of interfaces  including establishing 2D perovskites  wide bandgap perovskites  ammonium salts  and thin layers of inorganic compounds  Looking into the future development of post-treatment techniques toward the eventual commercialization of perovskite solar cells  one important aspect is to make these techniques more robust and scalable  which  in addition to further fundamental understanding of the detailed processes  calls for engineering efforts that engage with industrial enterprises  Another aspect is to develop new post-treatment strategies based on as yet undiscovered physical or chemical mechanisms  which are likely to be more powerful and practicable than the present ones  ReferencesHigh performance perovskite solar cells using multiple hole

Recently  due to high industrial development to maintain human high quality life  traditional energy sources  such as oil  coal  and natural gas  have been massively consumed  In addition to environment pollution  energy shortage has become extremely serious crisis  Consequently  the development of green renewable energy source is a very urgent research topic  Among the green renewable energy sources  solar energy source is substantially attracted due to its nonpollution and permanent sufficiency  In general  the solar energy sources include inorganic solar cells  organic solar cells  and perovskite solar cells [ 12345 ]  Although the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells were developed within the past ten years  its performances  however  were incredible progress [ 6 ]  The significantly improved performances were attributed to high visible light absorbance  high carrier mobility  low exciton binding energy  and low processing temperature [ 7  8 ]  In the standard structure  several metal oxide films were used as the hole transport layer of perovskite solar cells and organic solar cells [ 91011 ]  Among them  p-type NiOx film was promising material due to its low series resistance [ 12131415 ]  In this study  to improve performances  the NiO/Ag/NiO triple layers were deposited using a radio frequency magnetron sputtering system to work as the hole transport layer of perovskite solar cells  Recently  the mixed material of methylammonium iodide ( MAI  CH3NH3I ) and lead iodide ( PbI2 ) was widely used as the active layer of MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells [ 161718 ]  Since formamidine iodide ( FAI  HC ( NH2 ) 2I ) has broad light absorption  the perovskite FAxMA1−xPbI3 was used as the active layer of solar cells [ 19 ]  In this work  to study the functional features of FAI content  various FAI contents were blended with MAI material to replace a partial MA in the MAPbI3 and form FAxMA1−xPbI3 as the active layer of perovskite solar cells  To study the mechanism and the optimal content of FAI  various FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite solar cells were fabricated and analyzed  The current density–voltage ( J–V ) characteristics of the fabricated perovskite solar cells were measured using a J–V curve tracer under an illumination of 100 mW/cm2 with an AM 15 G solar simulator  2 Device fabrication experiments Figure 1 illustrates the schematic configuration of FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite solar cells with various NiO/Ag/NiO hole transport layers  After 250-nm-thick indium-tin-oxide-coated glass substrates were cleaned using successive treatment under ultrasonic bath in acetone  methanol  and deionized water  hole transport layers constructed by various-thick NiO layers and various NiO/Ag/NiO triple layers were deposited on the substrates using a radio frequency magnetron sputtering system  respectively  The MAPbI3 precursor solution was prepared by mixing methylammonium iodide ( MAI  040 g ) solute  lead iodide ( PbI2  116 g ) solute  γ-butyrolactone ( GBL  1 mL ) solvent  and dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO  2 mL ) solvent  After the MAPbI3 precursor solution was warmed up to 70 °C and stirred at a speed of 650 rpm for 12 h  it was spread on the hole transport layers as the active layer of MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells  Due to the broad light absorption of formamidine iodide ( FAI )  FAxMA1−xPbI3 precursor solutions were prepared by mixing various weighed FAI solutes with the above-prepared MAPbI3 precursor solution  The FAxMA1−xPbI3 precursor solutions were then stirred under 70 °C at a speed of 650 rpm for 12 h The various FAxMA1−xPbI3 active layers were obtained by spreading the prepared solutions on hole transport layers and then thermally annealed at 140 °C for 20 min in a nitrogen glove box with a H2O content of < 01 ppm and an O2 content of 20–30 ppm  During the spreading process  a drop of toluene was added after 4 s before the end and then dried at a spin speed of 5000 rpm for 30 s Finally  a thermal coater was used to deposit 30-nm-thick fullerene ( C60 ) electron transport layer ( ETL )  10-nm-thick bathocuproine ( BCP ) protection layer  and 100-nm-thick Ag cathode electrode  sequentially  Fig  1 figure 1 Schematic configuration of FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite solar cells Full size image The optical transmission of the various-thick NiO layers and the various NiO/Ag/NiO hole transport layers was measured using an UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer ( Hitachi U-4100 )  The surface morphologies of the NiO films and the various Ag/NiO films were observed by a scanning electron microscope ( SEM )  The crystalline of the various FAxMA1−xPbI3 films was measured using an X-ray diffractometer ( XRD )  The current density–voltage ( J–V ) characteristics of the resulting various FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite solar cells were evaluated at room temperature using a Keithley 2400 I–V curve tracer under an Air Mass 15 Global ( AM 15 G ) solar simulator ( 100 mW/cm2 ) and a chopped calibrated light beam from an xenon ( Xe ) lamp combined with a lock-in amplifier  respectively  The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra of the resulting various FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite solar cells were measured using an Xe lamp source with a power of 150 W and a monochromator  3 Experimental results and discussion At first  to study the optimal hole transport structure  various-thick NiO layers were respectively deposited on the substrates  in which the NiO thickness was chosen as 40  50  60  and 70 nm in this work  respectively  Using the UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer to measure the optical transmission of those NiO layers  it was found that the optical transmission of the NiO layer decreased with an increase of the NiO thickness  To further study the dependences of the performances of MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells on the NiO thickness  the various MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells were measured  Figure 2 shows the current density–voltage ( J–V ) characteristics of the MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells using various-thick NiO hole transport layers  The power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 821  871  1102  and 1072 % was obtained for the MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells with a NiO thickness of 40  50  60  and 70 nm  receptively  The associated external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of the MAPbI3 solar cells was shown in Fig  3  It was found that the MAPbI3 solar cells with a 60-nm-thick NiO hole transport layer revealed the best PCE and the best EQE  The dependent tendency of the EQE on the PCE exhibited the same results  It was deduced that the electrical property of the NiO hole transport layer was enhanced with an increase of the NiO thickness due to the improved quality  By trading off the transmission and the quality of the NiO hole transport layer  the optimal thickness of the NiO hole transport layer in the MAPbI3 solar cells was 60 nm  Fig  2 figure 2 Current density–voltage characteristics of MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells using various-thick NiO hole transport layers Full size image Fig  3 figure 3 External quantum efficiency spectra of MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells using various-thick NiO hole transport layers Full size image Based on the optimal NiO thickness of 60 nm  to study the optimal hole transport structure  4  7  and 10-nm-thick Ag layers were respectively sandwiched into the NiO ( 30 nm ) /Ag/NiO ( 30 nm ) hole transport layers  Figure 4 shows the transmission spectra of the 60-nm-thick NiO and the various NiO/Ag/NiO hole transport layers measured by UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer  The average transmission within the wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm was 668  686  704  and 631 % corresponded to the 60-nm-thick NiO and NiO/Ag/NiO with 30/4/30 nm  30/7/30 nm  and 30/10/30 nm  respectively  Using four-point probe measurement  the sheet resistance of the 60-nm-thick NiO and NiO ( 30 nm ) /Ag/NiO ( 30 nm ) with a sandwiched Ag thickness of 4  7  and 10 nm was 7700  340  236  and 141 Ω/sq  respectively  Figure 5a–d shows the scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) image of the surface of 60-nm-thick NiO layer  Ag ( 4 nm ) /NiO ( 30 nm ) layers  Ag ( 7 nm ) /NiO ( 30 nm ) layers  and Ag ( 10 nm ) /NiO ( 30 nm ) layers  respectively  It was found that nanostructured Ag layers were formed in the NiO/Ag/NiO hole transport layers  The reduced sheet resistance of the NiO/Ag/NiO hole transport layers was resulted from the Ag layer sandwiched into the NiO layers  Fig  4 figure 4 Transmission of various hole transport layers Full size image Fig  5 figure 5 Scanning electron microscope images of the surface of a

various hole transport layers  In the J–V curve measurements  the scanning voltage range was from 00 to 10 V  and the scanning step was 002 V with a scanning speed of 001 mV/s  By scanning the voltage from 00 to 10 V and then returning back to 00 V  the resulting hysteresis phenomenon was not clearly observed  Table 1 listed the photovoltaic characteristics of short-circuit current density ( Jsc )  open-circuit voltage ( Voc )  fill factor ( FF )  PCE  series resistance ( Rs )  and shunt resistance ( Rsh )  in which the listed data were the form of average value ± standard deviation  In general  the series resistance and shunt resistance could be calculated from the slope of the measured photocurrent characteristics [ 20  21 ]  It was found that the Voc of the perovskite solar cells using various hole transport layers was kept at a similar value  However  the associated Jsc  FF  and PCE values increased by increasing the Ag thickness from 0 to 7 nm  and then decreased with a further increasing the Ag thickness to 10 nm  Compared with the PCE of 1102 % by using the 60-nm-thick NiO hole transport layer  the optimal PCE value was improved to 1168 % by using the NiO/Ag/NiO ( 30/7/30 nm ) hole transport layer  To study the dependence of the PCE on the Ag thickness of the NiO/Ag/NiO hole transport layers  the EQE spectra of the various MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells were shown in Fig  7  It was found that the PCE tendency was the same as the EQE tendency  According to the experimental results shown in Figs  4 and 7  since the transmission spectra of the various hole transport layers were similar to the tendency of the EQE tendency  it could be deduced that the PCE of the various MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells were mainly determined by the hole transport structures  Fig  6

Full size image To study the functional features of various FAI contents in FAxMA1−xPbI3 active layers  the perovskite solar cells were fabricated using various FAxMA1−xPbI3 active layers as shown in Fig  1  in which the hole transport layer was 60-nm-thick NiO layer  Figure 8 shows the J–V characteristics of the various perovskite solar cells  The associated Jsc  Voc  FF  PCE  Rs  and Rsh were listed in Table 2  It was found that the optimal PCE of 1230 % was obtained for the perovskite solar cells using FA01MA09PbI3 ( ie  x = 01 ) active layer  The PCE of 1230 % and 1105 % for the perovskite solar cells using FA01MA09PbI3 and FA02MA08PbI3 active layers was larger than 1102 % for that using the MAPbI3 active layer  However  the PCE of 920 % for the FA03MA07PbI3 perovskite solar cells was smaller than that of the MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells  To study the dependent PCE of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite solar cells on the FAI content ( ie  x value )  the X-ray diffraction patterns of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 active layers were measured using a CuKα source and shown in Fig  9  The full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) of the ( 110 ) diffraction pattern of the MAPbI3 layer and the various FAxMA1−xPbI3 layers was kept at a similar value of 022°  However  the 2θ value of the ( 110 ) diffraction pattern for the various FAxMA1−xPbI3 layers was slightly reduced from 1408 to 1394° with an increase of x value from 0 to 03 due to the larger ionic radius of FAI  As shown in Fig  9  the intensity of the ( 110 ) diffraction pattern of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 layers was reduced by increasing x value from 01 to 03  As shown in Fig  9  the strongest intensity of the ( 110 ) diffraction pattern was obtained in the FA01MA09PbI3 layer and then decreased with an increase of the x value to 03  The enhanced crystallinity would increase the carrier mobility and reduce recombination rate in the active layer  Figure 10 shows the absorbance spectra of the perovskite solar cells using various FAxMA1−xPbI3 active layers  In the wavelength range between 300 and 600 nm  the absorbance of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 layers was reduced with an increase of x from 01 to 03  and the absorbance of FA03MA07PbI3 layer was less than that of MAPbI3 layer  It was also found that more FAI content in the FAxMA1−xPbI3 layers could extend the absorbance to a longer wavelength  Consequently  the optimal power conversion efficiency of 1230 % could be obtained in the perovskite solar cells using FA01MA09PbI3 active layer due to the best crystallinity and the highest absorbance  Fig  8 figure 8

characteristics and the photovoltaic characteristic of the resulting perovskite solar cells were shown in Fig  8 and listed in Table 2  respectively  Compared with the PCE of 1230 % for the FA01MA09PbI3 perovskite solar cells using 60-nm-thick NiO film  the PCE was improved to 1267 % by using NiO/Ag/NiO ( 30/7/30 nm ) hole transport layer  The enhanced PCE was attributed to the enhanced transmittance of the NiO/Ag/NiO ( 30/7/30 nm ) hole transport layer  4 Conclusion In this study  the functional features of the multiple NiO/Ag/NiO hole transport layer and the FAxMA1−xPbI3 active layer in the perovskite solar cells were investigated  The 60-nm-thick NiO layer and the various sandwiched Ag thicknesses in NiO ( 30 nm ) /Ag/NiO ( 30 nm ) triple layers were deposited as the hole transport layers using a radio frequency magnetron sputtering system  Using the measurement within the wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm  the average transmission of the 60-nm-thick NiO  NiO/Ag/NiO ( 30/4/30 nm )  NiO/Ag/NiO ( 30/7/30 nm )  and NiO/Ag/NiO ( 30/10/30 nm ) layers was 668  686  704  and 631 %  respectively  Compared with the conversion efficiency of 1102 % for the MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells using the 60-nm-thick NiO hole transport layer  the power conversion efficiency was improved to 1168 % by using the NiO/Ag/NiO ( 30/7/30 nm ) hole transport layer due to the resulting enhanced optical transmission  Furthermore  to broaden the light absorption  various FAxMA1−xPbI3 active layers were fabricated by blending various FAI contents with MAI material  Although the light absorption of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 could be extended to a longer wavelength by increasing the FAI content in the FAxMA1−xPbI3 active layers  the absorption within the wavelength range from 300 to 600 nm was reduced by increasing x value from 01 to 03  By trading off the above-mentioned phenomena  the power conversion efficiency of the FA01MA09PbI3 perovskite solar cells using the 60-nm-thick hole transport layers was improved to 1230 % compared with 1102 % of MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells  Furthermore  by integrating the optimal FA01MA09PbI3 active layer and the optimal NiO/Ag/NiO ( 30/7/30 nm ) hole transport layer  the power conversion efficiency of the resulting perovskite solar cells was enhanced to 1267 %  It is well known that the performances of perovskite solar cells are highly determined by the quality of the used materials  In this study  to gain further insight into the functional features of NiO/Ag/NiO hole transport layer and FAI content in FAxMA1−xPbI3 active layers

demonstrated in 2009 with cell efficiency quickly soaring from below 10 % to more than 23 % in a few years  Halide perovskites have the desirable processing simplicity but are very fragile when exposed to water and heat  This fragility represents a great challenge for the achievement of their full practical potential in photovoltaic technologies  To address this problem  here we review the recent development of the mixed-dimensional perovskites  whereby the trade-off between power conversion efficiency and stability of the material can be finely tuned using organic amine cations with

PSCs ) 1 have delivered power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) on par with that of polycrystalline silicon solar cells2  owing to the considerable research effort directed into the design and optimization of perovskite materials3  The efficiency race of PSCs has been accompanied by the questions concerning the real potential of PSCs for widespread deployment  When evaluating a PV technology with LCOE ( Levelized cost of electricity )  PCE  cost and lifetime are the three utmost criteria45  Since they determine the possibility of the technology to be accepted by the market  First and foremost  there come the concerns about the stability of intrinsic 3D hybrid perovskite materials  To ameliorate the notorious pitfall on the way  two main measures have been taken : providing sufficient protection to the perovskite material and increasing the intrinsic stability of the perovskite material  In the first case  a rich variety of methods have been developed : ( 1 ) exploration of moisture-resistant charge transporting materials and electrodes ; ( 2 ) interface modification of the devices by interfacial resistant agents ; and ( 3 ) proper encapsulation of the devices etc67  In the second case  three main strategies are typically used : ( 1 ) compositional engineering of halides and cations ( mixing cations and/or anions  adding additives ) within the 3D criteria of tolerance factor8910 ; ( 2 ) formation of low-dimensional polymorphs on 3D perovskite as a protective layer ; ( 3 ) formation of Ruddlesden–Popper type perovskite  The last two strategies to stabilize perovskite can be generally called multi-dimensional perovskite ( MDP )  In most instances  the gain in the long-term stability was accompanied by the sacrifice in the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) except the strategies represented by mixing three-dimensional ( 3D ) perovskites with low-dimensional ( 2D  1D  or 0D ) perovskites ( LDP ) 111213 to form MDP with a general formula of ( A ) 2 ( CH3NH3 ) n−1MnX3n+1 ( 1 ≤ n ≤ ∞ )  A systematic evolution of the dimensionality of the perovskite structure can be seen from Fig  1  Usually  inside a typical MDP film  perovskite phases with different n values and structural gradients from pure 2D perovskite to pure 3D perovskite coexist  Fig  1 figure 1 Dimensionality engineering  Effects of perovskite phase evolution on chemical and physical properties Full size image As one of the three main motivations14 behind the development of derivatives of hybrid halide perovskites  the MDP strategy showed the potential to provide parallelly improved stability and PCEs  The question : ‘ Is the MD perovskite a compromise or breakthrough ? ’ accompanied the searching for an optimized condition for the best MDP composition1115  Because except the stability  the bandgap and binding energy are also increasing with the decreasing of the dimensionality  while the conductivity and the figure of merits are decreasing ( Fig  1 )  In this review  we discuss how the hybrid perovskite material can be engineered to enable the discovery and design of more stable perovskite materials with less or no trade-off in PCE  focusing on tuning and mixing components with different dimensionalities ( MDP approach ) within the photovoltaically active region  We begin with an incomplete but representative summary of the photovoltaic performance of 1D  2D  MD  and 3D perovskites as shown in Table 1  based on which we provide additional insights into how the two types ( Class I and Class II ) of MDP could be designed or deposited in different cases to achieve balanced performance  Comparing with other approaches to stabilize 3D perovskite materials ( vide supra )  the MDP approach has the advantages of convenient  less cost  and taking effect in situ from inside of the materials  However  the deposition condition of Class I MDPs with low n numbers ( n equals 2 to 5 ) has to be judiciously controlled to have vertically aligned octahedron planes as the beneficial channel for charge transport ( vide infra )  Although most of the published works showed an apparently fixed n value  the film is actually formed of a mixture of perovskite domain with varied numbers  which can explain the seemingly contradictive Egs in Table 1  On the other hand  Class II MDPs films have a 3D perovskite body under the cover of LDP or non-perovskite polymorphs  They keep the low Eg inside while taking the advantage of high formation_energy of the external LDP  The phase disorder inside the film is much less since the LD perovskites are supposed to distribute mainly over the surface  This model is however hard to be verified directly without sophisticated equipment like Grazing Incidence Wide Angle X-Ray Diffraction ( GIWAXD )  The effect of protection can be weakened if the coverage of the LD perovskite is not sufficient  To date  the MDP strategy provided the most touching stability test result under in operando conditions  albeit not the world record PCE  As we have discussed before  the use of MDP will lead to the widening of Eg and the increase of resistance if the LDP is not properly deposited  Also  the realization of vertically aligned MDP needs expertized conduction of the deposition procedure  These drawbacks compromised photocurrent in MDP based devices  At the end of the discussion  we offer not only retrospective insights of known results  but also the strategies to nudge the compromise further into a breakthrough  Table 1 Photovoltaic performance and stability of 2D-MD-3D perovskites Full size table The evolution of dimensionality in hybrid halide perovskite The most popular lead iodide based perovskite structure ( rightmost panel of Fig  1  Fig  2a ) consists of an extended three-dimensional ( 3D ) network of corner-sharing PbI6 octahedra16  The organic cations fill the 12-fold coordinated voids among the octahedra  For a stable 3D perovskites  the suitable organic cation interact dynamically with the inorganic network to the extent that is imposed by the tolerance_factor t defined by ( RA + RX ) = t ( sqrt 2 ) ( RM + RX )  where RA  RM  and RX denote the ionic radii of the three ions in AMX317  Empirically speaking  perovskites with cubic crystal system should meet the requirement of 08 ≤ t ≤ 09  which allows a slightly extended range for distorted cases18  LDP features the structure of specifically cut or sliced 3D perovskite structure by specific organic cations ( Fig  2b–d )  LDPs including layered perovskites and chained perovskites were of scientific interest owing to their prominent excitonic  ferroelectric  ferroelastic  and third-order nonlinear optical properties19202122  The polymorphs of chained perovskites can be further classified into face-sharing chains of PbI6 octahedra and corner-sharing chains of PbI6 octahedra2324  Based on the 3D structure in Fig  2a  if one more –CH2 is added to the organic cation  the 3D structure is destroyed and 1D chain-structure forms  Adding another –CH2 will not change the situation ( Fig  2b  c )  Until n-butyl-ammonium is used as the cation  2D layered structures formed  corresponding to the case of n equals 1 and A site cation of butyl group in ( A2MnX3n+1 ) ( n is an integer  A is an aliphatic or aromatic primary ammonium  M is a divalent metal  and X is a halide anion ) ( Fig  2d )  When we combine the size constrained cations with the sterically hindered cations  MDPs formed  Stoumpos et albutyl-ammonium13  managed to solve the crystal structures of ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) n−1PbnI3n+1 ( BA : butyl-ammonium ; MA : methyl ammonium ; n equals 1 to 5 )  The visualized structure is beneficial to understand the stage of quasi-2D layered perovskite during the transition from monolayer 2D perovskite to infinite 3D perovskite after tuning the organic cation and stoichiometry of precursors  Moreover  almost all the MDP compounds reported to date are somewhere in between these cases  Fig  2 figure 2 Cation dependence of the crystal structure of perovskite and the quantum confinement effect  a 3D networks of CH3NH3PbI3 ; b 1D chains of CH3CH2NH3PbI3 ; c 1D

proved that the dimensionality can be harnessed to influence optical bandgap ( Eg ) of the perovskite material25  Especially  the Eg values of MDPs are directly influenced by the 2D confinement effect262728  of which the organic–inorganic Quantum Well structure of an MDP is shown in Fig  2e  For a Ruddlesden–Popper hybrid perovskite  the Eg is dependent on the well-width ( LQW ) 29 and the total Eg energy is determined by the Eg3D and extra quantization energies of the electron and hole30  For MAPbI3 in all the reported works  a band edge of 785 nm and a bandgap of 16 eV were measured  which is in agreement with each other and previous studies31  For EAPbI3 ( EA : ethyl ammonium ) and PAPbI3 ( PA : propyl ammonium ) with 1D chained structure  this value has been shifted to 568 and 523 nm  corresponding to a bandgap of 22 and 24 eV  respectively ( Fig  2f )  Moreover  there exists a significant dependence of Eg in the MDP ( quasi-2D layered ) perovskite ( ( A ) 2 ( CH3NH3 ) n−1MX3n+1 ) on the value of n  which is the indication of LQW ( Fig  2f  g )  In the case of ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) n−1PbnI3n+1 series  the sharp optical absorption edges increase in energy with decreasing n value from 150 eV ( n equals ∞ ) to 243 eV ( n equals 1 ) in the same manner of the dimension reduction303233  When the cation is changed to phenylethylammonium ( PEA )  the same dimensionality-bandgap relationship is observed34  With the decrease of n values from ∞ to 1  the energy absorption edge is shifting to higher energy levels  Quan et al  found that when n values are decreased  the conduction band minimum ( CBM ) becomes shallower  while the valence band maximum ( VBM ) shows a negligible variation  Yao et al35  prepared ‘ quasi 2D ’ perovskite compounds ( PEI ) 2 ( MA ) n−1PbnI3n+1 by incorporating polyethyleneimine ( PEI ) cations within the layered structure  In the range of n equals 3  5  or 7  the bandgap is calculated as 179  169  and 162 eV  respectively  It is worth noting that in this work when n equals 3  the resulted Eg is slightly smaller than that of ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) 2Pb3I10 due to stronger interactions between the organic−inorganic structures when multi ammonium cation is used3637  These endeavors  taken together  indicate the dimensionality  and resultant optical properties can be controlled in the MDP family ( Table 1 )  Interplay between dimensionality  PCE  and stability Research interests in the adoption of MDPs as a light absorber in PSCs are springing up in recent year  Frequently  two kinds of MDPs are used for the PV application : Class I MDP and Class II MDP ( Fig  1 )  Class I MDP also called ‘ Ruddlesden–Popper hybrid perovskite ’ have layered crystal structure and the general formula of ( ( A ) 2 ( CH3NH3 ) n−1MnX3n+1 ) ( n ≤ 60 ) 1213 ( Fig  1 )  In Class I MDP  the bulky organic cations ( A ) fragment the compact 3D perovskite structure into isolated inorganic layers of corner-sharing [ MX6 ] 4− octahedrons with certain layer number ( n ) 20  The existence of a multiphase system can be unambiguously characterized by X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) and/or UV absorption  This configuration has been found to increase the formation_energy and guard perovskite against attacking from the moisture34  As has been shown  the diversified choice of ‘ A ’ and ‘ n ’ endows MD perovskites flexibly tunable and controllable optoelectronic properties  Smith et al  reported the first demonstration of Class I MDP in PSCs in 201411  They presented a single crystal structure of ( PEA ) 2 ( MA ) 2Pb3I10 ( PEA+ denotes phenylethylammonium cation )  with dark red color  This is a typical Class I MDP with a clear n value of 3 indicating the number of inorganic layers  However  they found that the spin-coated thin film is composed of a mixture of polymorphs with a different number of layers ( n equals 1  2  3  4  and 5 ) due to the rapid reorganization process  The MDP based devices showed overall PCE of 473 %  Despite the low PCE  this MDP displayed excellent moisture resistance even after aging for 46 days under 52 % RH  while the MAPbI3 based film changed from black to yellow in the meantime ( Table 1 )  The second Class I MDP was synthesized by Cao et al12  with a general formula of ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) n−1PbI3n+1 ( BA+ denotes n-butyl-ammonium cation )  The single crystal data illustrated vivid  layered structures  To avoid the formation of multiple orders of perovskites in the film for devices  they adopted a low-temperature deposition process  Again  unsatisfactory PCEs of 402 % were obtained from the Class I MDP with n equaling 3 ( ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) 2Pb3I10 )  Satisfactory stability over two months was observed  In the end  the authors concluded that solution cast Class I MDPs have another problem that the ( 00l ) and ( 0l0 ) planes prone to grow parallel to the plane of the substrate  leading to deficient charge transport in the ( 111 ) direction ( out-of-plane ) due to the intercalated insulative organic cation layers  Stoumpos further pushed the limit of n in BA/MA mixed Class I MDP to 5 and used the BA2MA4Pb5I16 as an active layer in PSC devices38  The phase purity was verified by the XRD patterns  The obtained pure compound with n equaling 5 was measured to have a direct bandgap ( Eg ) of 183 eV  The planar junction solar cells with the as made thin films demonstrated an improved PCE of 871 %  These studies with phase pure Ruddlesden–Popper hybrid perovskite121338 provided benchmarks facilitating the determination of the composition in a casted film  So far  the structures of Ruddlesden–Popper type perovskites with n from 2 to 5 have been disclosed by X-ray crystallographic technique  With the increase of n values ( n → ∞ )  the minority bulky cations will be treated as impurities and expelled from the crystal lattice to stay on the surface of the crystal or in the boundary between the crystals  In this case  we call it Class II MDP  which has the ambiguous solid structure without a clearly deduced n value ( without or with minimum new phase and/or no noticeable change in physiochemical properties ) 39 but maximumly balanced stability versus optoelectronic performance40  For example  a thin ( BA ) 2PbI4 layer formed on the surface and at the grain boundaries of 3D perovskite can enhance the thermal stability of the devices and increase the PCE to 1956 % 41  In a similar report  a 3D–2D-graded perovskite film resulted in an overall PCE of 1989 % 42  Very recently  Lee et al43 incorporation of PEA2PbI4 into the precursor solution of FAPbI3  The 2D perovskite spontaneously formed at the grain boundaries of FAPbI3 and gave a stabilized PCE of 2064 % ( certified stabilized PCE of 1977 % )  Guidelines have been established to select suitable bulky cations for the formation of Class I MDP  Firstly  the bulky organic molecule should contain specific numbers of protonated primary or secondary amines that can efficiently interact with the extended inorganic anionic frameworks through forming hydrogen bonds  yielding 2D LDP with the general formulas of ( RNH3 ) 2MX4 or ( NH3RNH3 ) MX44445  Another structural requirement to form layered perovskites is about the size and shape of the organic parts  Although the bulky molecules step out of the cavity within the 3D AMX3 perovskite structure  these molecules should still be able to accommodate themselves within the ‘ footprint ’ offered by the 2D inorganic framework4647  A recent study by Kamminga et al48 indicated that extending the length of the alkyls in bulky cations can turn on the 1D quantum confinement effect in a 2D quantum confined lead iodide hybrids  The quick crystallization process of MDP normally led to the variation of degrees of quantum confinement  which will create a fluctuating energy landscape and severely limit hole diffusion lengths  Efforts have been put to control over this QW width distribution  and Proppe et al49 showed that higher performance could be achieved by reducing the content of lower n QWs  So far  bulky cations like PEA11 and BA12 are the most popularly adopted candidates in making ‘ quasi-2D ’ structures when n is greater than 1 as the Class I MDP  The criteria for the formation of 1D quantum confined ( chained ) perovskite frameworks are more complicated and therefore undefined  Medium ammonium cations like EA and PA as well as many Lewis bases type polar molecules ( DMSO  DMF  Urea ) can slice the lattice of PbX2 to form [ PbIm− ] ∞ Chains50  They are typically used in combination with MA and FA based 3D perovskite to form the Class II MDP405152  The formation mechanisms of Class II MDP are more complicated and can be classified into three folds : 2D/3D top capping mode53  2D/3D interspersing mode5455  and interface passivation mode405657  Class II MDPs formed from any of these mechanisms contained non-stoichiometric cation ratios  and hence the ‘ n ’ value is undefined and treated as approaching infinite  More examples can be found in Table 1  See Box 1 for the different processing methods toward ( a ) Class I and ( b ) Class II MDPs  Box 1 Processing methods toward ( a ) Class I and ( b ) Class II MDPs Processing methods of the Class I and Class II MDPs Class I MDP is usually made following the traditional one-step deposition methods  disparate synthesis protocols have been developed to make Class II MDP films  which are typically formed by one-step deposition of non-stoichiometric precursor solutions4058  solution cation exchange42515759  and sequential deposition56  There is no defined n value and/or evident second phase in the formed solid film  Therefore  we treat in this case the ‘ n ’ value as approaching infinity ( quasi-3D )  figure a Show more Enhanced PCE and stability by vertically aligned Class I MDP To solve the above-mentioned problem of mismatched horizontal orientation of Ruddlesden–Popper type perovskites60  Tsai et al61 used so-called ‘ hot-casting ’ technique to fabricate Class I MDP thin films with near-single-crystalline quality  ( Fig  3a ) More importantly  the ( 00l ) and ( 0l0 ) planes of the inorganic perovskite component turned out to show prominent out-of-plane alignment preference relative to the substrate electrode and as such facilitating efficient charge transport  ( Fig  3d ) The MDP film with a claimed composition of ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) 3Pb4I13 showed PCE of 1252 % without hysteresis  The devices exhibited significantly enhanced stability compared to their 3D counterparts under the same level of light  humidity  and heat exposure  Unpackaged devices retained more than 60 % of their initial efficiency after 2250 h under continuous  standard ( AM15G ) illumination  No degradation was observed when the devices are encapsulated  At the same time  a device based on ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) 2Pb3I10 ( n equals 3 ) showed comparable PCE of 1144 %  Similarly  Zhang et al62  demonstrated Cs+-doped ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) 3Pb4I13-based PSC giving a PCE of 137 %  the highest among the reported Class I MDP devices  The device doped with 5 % Cs+ degraded merely 10 % after exposure to 30 % relative humidity ( RH ) for 1400 hours  indicating notably enhanced stability under heating and high moisture conditions  The same method was later adopted by several other groups6364  The mechanism and the control of the vertical growth of the Class I MDP is not fully understood until recently when Chen et al65 proposed that the nucleation and growth of vertically orientated 2D perovskite may arise from the liquid-air interface and the ‘ pre-crystallization annealing ’ ( Fig  3b )  Fig  3 figure 3 Vertically grown Class I MDPs via different methods  a Immediate deposition on the hot substrate ; b deposited via ‘ pre-crystallization annealing ’ ; c deposited with NH4SCN-modified precursor solution  d The resulted MDP films provide direct pathways for charge carriers Full size image Besides the hot-casting method  Chen and colleagues used NH4SCN additive with the optimized ratio to regulate the orientated growth of MDP films with either BA or PEA as the bulky cations  ( Fig  3c ) The first try with ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) 2Pb3I10 and ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) 3Pb4I13 as absorbers in p-i-n-type devices gave average PCE of 682 % and 879 %  respectively  with excellent stability when 1 equivalent NH4SCN was added66  In a following report  the same group added 2 equivalents of NH4SCN into ( PEA ) 2 ( MA ) 4Pb5I16 and presented the best PCE of 1101 % 67  Moreover  it is worth mentioning again that the perovskite films reported in the above four pieces of work should be mixed phases with different n values as indicated by the extended absorption edges and the position/broadening of photoluminescence spectra  Therefore  it is not scientifically correct to claim as the original work did that the films in the devices were made of MD perovskite with a specific n value  All the formulas mentioned above were only used as an indication of the ingredients in the initial recipe  The bottleneck in the PCE enhancement of Class I MDP While synchronously increased stability and PCE were observed in the Class I MDP based devices  there is an apparent disparity between their PCE and that of 3D perovskites  The reported Class I MDP with well-defined solid structure and/or clearly new phases ended at n = 603468 ( Fig  4 )  On the left side of Fig  4  examples of 1D and 2D perovskite are shown  The black bars denote the number of PbI62− layers ( n )  From 1D perovskite to 2D perovskite  the layer number ( n ) increased from 0 to 1  The blue region of Fig  4 illustrates some properties of Class I MDP and the related devices  In this region  the ‘ n ’ value increase from left to right until 60  The bandgap ( Eg ) ( red bars ) is decreasing with the increasing of n With the same n value but Br− as the anion  the Eg is larger than that when the I− is the anion  More importantly  the PCE ( green bars ) is increasing with the increase of n value  and the BA cation based perovskite gave higher PCEs than PEA based perovskite does  Quan et al  also measured and plotted device performance against the layer number ( n value )  which showed that the performance was increasing with the increase of n value  while the stability was decreased in the meantime ( Fig  5a )  For example  the devices with 3D perovskite degraded over eight weeks from a PCE of 166 % to < 3 % even stored in N2  while the performance of the device with n equaling 40 with a similar initial PCE dropped to 131 % after 60 days under the same conditions  Therefore  in the region of Class I MDP  PCEs usually are compromised for the stability with the highest reported PCE of 154 %  contrasting to the state-of-the-art PCE from 3D perovskite of 233 % 269  Breakthrough has to be made for such kind of MDPs to improve the PCE and stability further  The correlation between PCE and bandgap energy is plotted in Fig  5b  The inferior PCE with Class I MDPs is partially due to their wide bandgaps as a result of limited layer number ( Fig  5b )  Fig  4 figure 4 Structure characteristics and device

function of bandgaps  ( Plotted with data in Table 1  blue background : Class I MDP ; orange background : Class II MDP ) Full size image The counterpoise between PCE and stability in Class II MDP Lessons learned from the study of Class I MDP pushed the researchers to think about more effective ways of utilizing LDP in the formation of MDPs  namely minority 2D/3D hybrid system and interface passivation  Two synthesis methods can lead to the minority 2D/3D hybrid system : post-ammonium-treatment to form top capping mode and in situ growth to form interspersing mode ( Fig  6a  b )  In the case of post-ammonium-treatment  Hu et al54  tried to convert the top layer of the 3D MAPbI3 perovskite into an LDP by spin-coating isopropyl alcohol ( IPA ) solution containing mixed methyl ammonium iodide ( MAI ) with phenylethylammonium iodide ( PEAI ) or n-butyl-ammonium iodide ( BAI ) onto the MAPbI3 film to form 3D/LDP heterojunction systems ( Fig  6a )  Grazing-incidence XRD confirmed the formation of such kind of structure  However  there is no clear border between the two phases  and there is no information about the thickness of each layer  The devices based on a MAPbI3/PEAMAPI heterojunction reach PCE of up to 1684 %  They also observed the enhancement in device stability toward exposure to moisture  Bai et al42 treated the 3D perovskite film with a saturated toluene solution of phenylethylammonium iodide ( PEAI ) instead of pure toluene in the anti-solvent treatment step prior to annealing of the films  Remarkably  they made atomically sharp interface at the border of 3D and 2D perovskite as proved by Tof-SIMS measurement  which was described as the formation of a 2D capping layer together with 3D perovskite or namely 3D–2D graded interface  Like the previous Class II MDP  with this innovation  they realized an excitingly high PCE of 1989 % in a p-i-n device and much-increased moisture/thermal stability as well as suppressed cross-layer ion migration  Fig  6 figure 6 Schematic representation of the two proposed mechanisms to form Class II MDP  a  b 2D/3D hybrid mode535455 ; c Interface passivation mode405657 Full size image As we have introduced in the section about Class I MDP  the n-butyl-ammonium ( BA+ ) was superior to the PEA+ counterparts  However  few examples were shown in the Class II MDP until recently  Wang et al53 tested a range of in situ grown BAx ( FA083Cs017 ) 1−xPb ( I06Br04 ) 3 with x varying from 0 to 1 from the mixed precursor solutions  The authors observed additional reflections in the XRD patterns of MDP perovskites with the increase of the BA concentration  They believe the reflections came from ( BA ) 2 ( FA083Cs017 ) n−1Pb ( I06Br04 ) 3n+1 phases of which the n values can not be precisely assigned  ( Maybe a mixture of different n values ) ( Fig  6b ) In the end  they achieved a champion stabilized PCEs of 195 % and 173 % based on MD perovskites with a bandgap of 161 and 172 eV  respectively  They claimed the observation of 2D perovskite platelets interspersing between highly orientated 3D perovskite grains perpendicularly to the plane of the film  which suppresses non-radiative charge recombination  This film is realized by a post burn-in procedure ( 175 °C ) similar to the method in Fig  3c and can be seen as a composite of 2D and 3D perovskite  In the end  they reported enhanced stability under simulated sunlight  Devices sustain 80 % of their ‘ post-burn-in ’ efficiency after 1000 h in air  and close to 4000 h when encapsulated  Another proposed mechanism is called interface passivation  which means the introduced bulky cations did not induce the formation of a new phase but only anchored on the surface or intercalated between the grain boundary to form a passivation layer ( Fig  6c )  The first typical example is given by Zhao et al62  who introduced selected diammonium iodide by post-treating 3D ( MAPbI3 )  The difference in this study from previously discussed reports is that they used rigid NH3I ( CH2 ) 8NH3I ( C8 ) instead of short BA or flexible NH3I ( CH2 ) 2O ( CH2 ) 2NH3I ( EDBE )  Instead of inducing 3D to 2D perovskite phase transformation  the C8 diammonium iodide can successfully passivate perovskite surface ( I vacancy ) and grain boundaries ( GBs ) due to the elevated activation energy arising from its unique anti-gauche isomerization  The passivated device showed a much-improved PCE of 1760 % compared to the control device showing a PCE of 1464 %  Later  Lu et al62 used comparatively low concentrations of diammonium cations to prevent the formation of pure 2D structures  In this case  the addition of an insignificant amount of short ethane-12-diammonium ( EDA+ ) ( eg  08 mol % ) into the precursor solution  which did not induce the formation of a new phase but improved the PCE under one sun irradiation from 167 % ± 06 % to 179 % ± 04 % ( aperture of 016 cm2 )  The authors demonstrated certified PCE of 152 % ± 05 % with the large active area ( aperture 104 cm2 )  Moreover  the in operando stability test of EDA2+/MA+-based solar cells showed 75 % retention of the initial PCE after 72 h at 50 % RH and 50 °C under one sun illumination  while the MAPbI3-based devices degrade by 90 % after 15 h Gao and colleagues40 used a novel fluorinated aliphatic cation ( trifluoroethyl amine iodide ) to modify MAPbI3 perovskite and enhance the environmental stability without compromising the performance of the devices  After introducing 3 mol % FEAI additives into the perovskite precursor solution  the average PCE of the mesoporous PSC significantly increased from of 156 to 180 %  Due to the hydrophobic nature of the CF3-terminal group over the surface of the 3D perovskite  moisture resistance is enhanced without forming wide Eg 2D perovskite  which represents a new paradigm of stabilizing PSCs  Phenylethylammonium ( PEA ) is the first bulky cation used in Class I MDPs11 and the highest PCE achieved in Class I MDP ( n equals 60 ) was around 16 % from one-step deposition method34  Recently  Li et al56  deposited mixed solution of FAI/PEAI ( MFAI/MPEAI equals 40 ) atop preformed PbI2 film to convert it into perovskites  Instead of forming a new phase  the PEA+ self-assembled on both the surface and grain boundaries of 3D FAPbI3 via induced π–π interactions  which can increase the phase transition energy and reinforce phase stability  As a result  a high PCE of 177 % with superior phase and ambient stability was successfully demonstrated  Wang et al51  further entrusted various phenylalkylamines the mission of moisture resistance  They introduced directly 3 vol % of basic amines ( not ammonium salt ) in chlorobenzene onto the preformed 3D FAPbI3 by spin-coating  No new phase was detected  and the presence of the passivation layer and its chemical bonding to the perovskite can only be confirmed by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR ) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) measurements  With this method  they successfully fabricated PSCs using benzylamine treatment with PCEs above 19 % and kept stable in moisture air for more than four months  Coincidentally  Lin et al41 compared the effect of treatments by either n-BA or n-BAI and they got PCEs around 19 % from both cases  At the far right of Fig  4 and bottom of Table 1  parameters of typical 3D perovskites including stability test information were listed for comparison  Among them  the mixed-cations 3D perovskite gave excellent PCE above 22 %  Apparently  the Class II MDP combined the merits from both 3D perovskites ( high PCE ) and Class I MDP ( high stability )  with the highest PCE above 19 % with the equally competitive stability ( Table 1  Fig  4 )  Stability enhancement with MDP Intrinsic and extrinsic factors The degradation pathways of a PSC device can be complicated and related to many factors from all the components  Generally  they are unstable when exposed to humidity  high temperatures  and light7071  The factors inducing degradation in PSCs can be classified as intrinsic and extrinsic  which take effect under different timescale as illustrated in Fig  7  To be specific  the extrinsic factors that can lead to degradation include H2O ( moisture )  voltage bias stimulus  temperature  photon stimulus  oxygen  etc  that come from the ambient environment  While the intrinsic instable factors include the hygroscopicity and volatile organic cations  ion conductive nature of perovskite material  solid–solid diffusion  To destroy a PSC device  the extrinsic and intrinsic factors sometimes take effect alone and sometimes there are synergistic effects from both the extrinsic and intrinsic factors  for example  the UV-induced catalytic degradation  Most extrinsic factors can destroy the device in a relatively short timescale  while intrinsic factors usually are working during a longer timescale  Firstly  in a few seconds  the device can be failed upon exposure to bulk water72  Then under working conditions  the voltage bias can lead to macroscopic migration of a large amount of I− ion in minutes73  Moreover  the temperature has a significant impact on the structural stability of the perovskite from two different aspects  For one thing  a variation of temperature transforms the symmetry of crystal from orthorhombic to tetragonal and finally to cubic74 ; for another  further  increase the temperature can destroy the perovskite film and leave PbI2 behind in hour-timescale75  For a similar reason  under thermal stress  the element of the metal electrode ( eg  Au  Ag  Al  etc  ) can migrate following the Fick ’ s Law76 across the hole-transporting layer ( HTL ) and into the perovskite layer after days  which will severely affect the in operando device performance7778  The water vapor absorbed from the ambient can hydrolyze the perovskite and form activated cations such as CH3NH2  which escape slowly from the surface of the perovskite film  Meanwhile  the exposure of the film to oxygen and light over months can further accelerate the decomposition of the cation salt and hydroiodide and generate more and more free iodine  which can dope the active layers79  With encapsulation  light exposure induced decomposition of perovskite at the interface between metal oxide based photoanodes ( eg  TiO2  SnO2 etc ) and perovskite can be slowed down  which will however still happen over the years due to their photocatalytic effects80  All the above degradation mechanisms inseparably interconnected  and the short timescale mechanisms usually promote long timescale mechanisms8182  Fig  7 figure 7 Degradation analysis of a PSC device and the influence of MDP strategy  a

) Full size image Degradation mechanism The motivation behind the rising of MDPs is the potential to increase the operating stability but not necessarily compromise the PCE  Piles of works have proved that the MDP strategy did improve the stability of the PSCs  To identify the mechanism behind the MDP materials  Quan et al  studied the stability of dimensionally tuned Class I MDPs using density functional theory ( DFT ) simulations  and calculated formation energies ( E ) 34  ( Eq  1 ) Calculations show that the E value and decomposition lifetimes are decreasing with the increasing of n value  While conventional 3D perovskites have the lowest formation_energy  therefore they tend to reversely decompose into PbI2 and MAI constituents  as have been evidenced by experiments83  This process starts from the surface of the material  where molecules have sufficient freedom to rearrange  $ $ E = frac { { E_ { ( { mathrm { PbI } } _2 ) _n ( { mathrm { MAI } } ) _ { n - 1 } ( { mathrm { PEAI } } ) _2 } - nE_ { { mathrm { PbI } } _2 } - left ( { n - 1 } right ) E_ { { mathrm { MAI } } } - 2E_ { { mathrm { PEAI } } } } } { n } $ $ ( 1 ) Since the predicated formation enthalpy per molecule required to recrystallize the MAI layer is about 055 eV but −06 eV for PbI2  MAI capping is serving as a protection layer  while the PbI2 surface termination is inherently unstable84  On the other hand  the calculated energies needed for desorption of MAI and PEAI from perovskite into gas phase are 215 and 251 eV  respectively  MAI is  therefore  easier to escape from the solid surface than PEAI to leave unstable PbI2 surface behind  According to the differences ( 036 eV ) between the energy required to remove PEAI from the perovskite and that for MAI  they conclude that the adoption of MDP ( either Class I or Class II ) over 3D Perovskite can reduce the desorption rate by six orders of magnitude  and slowdown film decomposition by 1000-fold  Figure 7c shows that an increased performance can achieve when increasing the n value ; however  in the meantime  stability is decreasing  There is a region where MDP can find a balance between PCE and lifetime  Lifetime tests An immediate example was shown recently by Grancini that one-year stable perovskite devices can be realized by engineering an ultra-stable Class II MDP ( AVA ) 2PbI4/CH3NH3PbI3 ( AVA : 5-ammoniumvaleric acid ) perovskite junction58  A gradually organized multi-dimensional interface is formed and showed PCE up to 129 % in a carbon-based architecture  and 146 % in standard mesoporous solar cells  More importantly  the 10 × 10 cm2 solar modules by a fully printable industrial-scale process  delivering 112 % efficiency with zero loss during the measurement period ( more than 10000 h )  This is so far the most extended lifetime test on a PSC solar module ( Table 1 )  In Fig  7d  a correlation between the PCE drop versus aging time span is plotted based on data in Table 1 about different types of perovskites  Without considering the testing conditions like humidity and temperature  the data shows that although 3D perovskites were reported with unexpectedly good stability under test  MDP perovskites were tested with the twice longer time span  Although the ever-extending span of lifetime test is exciting  one must be soberly aware that most of the stability measurements were not carried out under the same standard conditions  eg  unified relative humidity  temperature  light intensity  atmosphere and the same fitting function of PCE retention  Therefore  it is hard to compare the results of two lifetime tests from two different reports from different or even the same lab ( s )  Moreover  most of the reported time-dependent change of PV parameters were based on normalized ( to 1 ) data of arbitrary cells  which can hardly be related to the stability of the champion devices  Given the facts above  it is necessary to consolidate the testing conditions for the evaluation of the stability of a perovskite solar cell  It is well known that there exist the standard damp heat conditions ( 85oC and 85 % relative humidity ( RH ) for 1000 h ) as related to International Electrotechnical Commission ( IEC ) test 6090485 and 6164686  so far  however  most of the lab-made devices were obviously tested under various customized conditions87  ( Table 1 ) It is recommended that all the devices that are promising be tested under 100 mW cm−2 15 AM illumination with standard damp heat conditions  Then we can screen out and identify the most promising perovskite recipes and device engineering methods  Conclusions and perspectives MDPs have been accepted as potential candidates to circumvent the dilemma of high performance but low ambient instability with conventional 3D perovskites  Comparing to pure 3D and LD perovskites  multi-dimensional perovskites ( MDP ) maintain balanced performances  bandgaps  charge transporting properties  and ambient stability  which are critical for photovoltaic applications  After the meticulous analysis of the reported data  two important points should be considered during the design of the new MDP  Firstly  techniques like hot-casting or so-called ‘ pre-crystallization annealing ’ should be adopted to induce vertical growth of perovskite crystallites since the intrinsic 2D perovskites tend to grow parallel to the plane of the substrate and the charge transfer efficiency in the normal direction ( to the charge selective contact layers ) is very low  This is very important in the case of Class I MDP and so far  PCEs of above 15 % have been realized with notable long-term stability using this method62  However  one should keep in mind that hot-spin-casting is not compatible with large-scale processing  It may be possible to integrate the ‘ pre-crystallization annealing ’ into techniques like roll-to-roll printing or doctor-blading  In the meantime  the mechanism of additive induced oriented growth of perovskite should be further studied  If the same type of morphology  the namely vertical growth of MD perovskite crystallites  can be realized  the mass production of perovskite solar module will benefit from such stable perovskite material  The second point is about the interfacial and grain boundary engineering in Class II MDP  Instead of adding the chemical stoichiometric amount of bulky cations  Class II MDP includes the MDPs with partially substituted MA+ or FA+ on the surface of grain by bulky  hydrophobic organic cations  This strategy has been affirmed as one of the most effective ways to improve the stability of perovskites without sacrificing device performances  So far the Class I MDPs with Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite structure have provided devices with improved stability and moderate PCEs  whereas interfacial modifications and passivation in Class II MDPs further push the device PCE up to 20 % and on par with 3D perovskite53  Mechanisms behind the remarkably enhanced long-term stability have been simulated and proved by experiments  In this review  based on the analysis of the most updated research results  we anticipate that even stronger motivation and more efforts will be invested in the research of new MDP with new hydrophobic cations for both higher PCEs and stability  The stability test conditions should be standardized to the industry conditions  and better stability performance should be realized with MDPs ( < 5 % loss in PCE after tested at 85oC and 85 % RH for 1000 h )  Sharing the merits of the low-cost manufacturing property of 3D perovskites  such as roll-to-roll slot die-coating  screen-printing  or ink-jet printing technologies  large area MDP modules with improved ambient stability will be the real breakthrough and challenger to the state-of-the-art Si-based PVsMagnetic  Electronic  and Optical Properties of Perovskite Materials Lin Fu  Bo Li  Shuang Li & Longwei Yin Chapter First Online : 03

present numerous advantages in electronic  magnetic  and optical properties  In the last few years  because of the strong electron–electron interaction with the 3d manifold and considerable physical strength  scientists have paid a great deal of attention to magnetic properties of perovskite materials  especially B-site substituted perovskite and perovskite manganite  The B-site substituted perovskites are a great playground for magnetic properties  as various combinations of different paramagnetic cations are possible at all of the three cation sites  allowing for a wide range of magnetic behaviors  Perovskite manganites have a wide range of magnetic properties  such as colossal multiferroic property  magnetocaloric effect  and magnetoresistance  There are various applications in magnetism such as magnetic refrigeration  bioprocessing  and miniaturized magnetic sensor applications  In addition  the electronic structure of perovskite materials is predominantly determined by the BX6 ions  while the distinctive electronic character of perovskite materials is basically induced by the lone pair of lead ions  Moreover  one of the remarkable aspects of halide perovskites is that the grain boundaries are electrically benign  Therefore  it is promising to produce high-quality semiconductor films from solution processing methods for various photoelectric devices  2 Magnetic Properties Recently  because of the discovery of B-site substituted perovskite oxides A2B′B″X6 and nanoscale manganese-based perovskite oxides ( AMnO3 ) which have colossal magnetoresistance  the studies of magnetic properties of perovskite materials have attracted a great deal of attention  They are used in the areas of sensors  catalysts  magneto-optical materials  fuels cells  et al  Because of their unusual magnetic properties  recently there has been particular interest in the case of transition metal perovskite oxides  These perovskite oxides have special magnetic properties due to the strong electron–electron interaction with the 3d manifold and a considerable physical strength [ 1 ]  For instance  Cai reported that half-metallic ferromagnetism leads to giant magneto-optical Kerr effects in the BiNiO3 with the orthorhombic structure  In the Hessler compound PtMnSb  Kerr rotation reached 128° at 187 eV  which is compared to the accepted maximum polarity Kerr rotation of 135° at 175 eV  The great p-d exchange influences half-metallic ferromagnetism with the semiconducting majority-spin electrons and the metallic minority-spin electrons  leading to large Kerr rotation of BiNiO3 finally [ 2 ]  The perovskite structure has the compositional flexibility and excellent structue  Recently  half of the B-site cations have attracted a lot of attention  and these cations have been replaced by another cation  In this case  Bʹ and B″ may keep disordered  or they can order at the B-site  forming a so-called A2BʹB″X6  of which B-site ordered double perovskite  There are three ways that the B-site cations ordered  the structure increases the modifiability and complexity of the perovskite compounds  as shown in Fig  1  In addition  the two different cations existing in B-site leads to novel and interesting combinations  ranging from 3d  4d  or 5d transition metals from actinoides and lanthanoides to main group elements  whose oxidation states are various  Because of the fact that B-site cations determine the magnetic order and electrical conductivity of A2BʹB″X6  potential new materials with each cation combination and ordering can be ensured in a wide range  Fig  1 figure 1 ( Reprinted with permission from Ref  [ 3 ]  Copyright 2010  Published by The Royal Society of Chemistry ) The B-site cation combinations of A2B′B″X6 perovskites : a rock-salt  b layered and c columnar order [ 3 ] Full size image The double perovskites are of good magnetic properties  For the reason that various combinations of paramagnetic cations are able to fit in these cation sites of A2BʹB″X6  a large number of magnetic performances can be achieved  Although some compounds are antiferromagnetic ( AFM )  a variety of ferromagnetic ( FM ) or ferrimagnetic ( FiM ) compounds have been found in A2BʹB″X6 perovskite ” compared to other oxides  Some have very high magnetic ordering temperature ( TC )  In addition  considering the magnetic properties  the degree of cation order is very important  The spin-glass behavior has been observed with significant long-range magnetic properties in several disordered compounds  For example  low-dimensional magnetic properties have been found in JT distorted A2CuB″X6  In so far as a single paramagnetic B-site cation in the A2BʹB “ X6 perovskite  the super-exchange interaction occurs over a relatively long distance  What is interesting is that the strength of the 90° B″–O– ( B′ ) –O–B″nearest-neighbor ( NN ) interactions and the 180° B′–O–B″–O–B′ next-nearest-neighbor ( NNN ) interactions can often be of the same order  and can compete  The relative strength of these interactions depends on the nature of the paramagnetic ions  For example  it has been noted that the 90° B′–O–O–B′ interactions are stronger compared to 180° B′–O–B″–O–B′ in certain Ru compounds  due to the fact that the  eg  orbitals of Ru are empty  so only π-interactions possible [ 4 ]  Similarly we would expect compounds with full t2g orbitals and half-filled  eg  orbitals to have relatively stronger 180° interactions  In case of two magnetic B-site cations  things are a bit more complicated  There may be short-range B′–O–B″ interactions between the B-site cations  as well as long-range B′–O– ( B″ ) –O–B′ and B″–O– ( B′ ) –O–B″ ones  It would perhaps be expected that the short-range B′–O–B″ interactions would be the strongest interaction in the system  dominating the magnetic ordering  However  in A2B′B″X6 perovskites  the B″–O– ( B′ ) –O–B″ superexchange interactions may sometimes be stronger than B′–O–B″ interactions  due to weaker energetic orbital overlap of the two different B-site cations  This has been shown for example in case of Sr2CoOsO6  where the two B-cation sublattices order independently and at different temperatures [ 5 ]  Several compounds with B′ = R and B″ = transition metal  such as various A2RRuO6 compounds  Sr2TbIrO6 and Ba2NdOsO6  show the same behavior of the two B-cation sublattices ordering at different temperatures  Apparently  the orbital mixing between the lantanoides and the transition metals is weak enough that the long-range superexchange interactions dominate the magnetic ordering  The energetic overlap of the two B-site cation orbitals is often poor in the A2B′B″O6 perovskites  Thus  it could be relatively common for the long-range B′–O– ( B″ ) –O–B′ superexchange to be stronger than the short B′–O–B″ interaction in these compounds  It is also possible to place paramagnetic cations at the A-position of the A2B′BʺO6 perovskite  Compounds having Mn2+ or paramagnetic R in A-position are well-known  In this case  between A and B-site cations  there is possibly a magnetic coupling  For instance  Mn and Fe of Mn2FeSbO6 are spin-coupled to produce an elliptical spin helix with a disproportionate propagation vector [ 6 ]  The paramagnetic ions are also likely to occupy all three cation sites  such as Nd2NiMnO6  in which Ni and Mn order FM to each other at 200 K while Nd is ordered AFM to the B-site cations at 45 K [ 7 ]  However  the interaction between the A and B cations is usually very weak  For example  in R2LiRuO6  the Ru–O– ( Li ) –O–Ru interaction is stronger than the R–O–R or R–O–Ru interaction [ 8 ]  This may be mainly because of the weak orbital mixing of lanthanide and transition metal elements  It is interesting to point out that Pb in A-site can improve magnetic properties because of the super-exchange interactions of electrons in Pb 6s [ 9 ]  Comparing with Pb or Sr in A-site  it has been found that the magnetic temperatures of A2BʹNbO6  A2NiReO6  A2MnWO6  and A2FeTiO6 are higher [ 10 ]  JT distortion due to d1 configuration is rare but has been found in A2B ’ BʺX6 perovskites occasionally  In the case of Ba2SmMoO6  both JT distortion coincides and TN appears  where the relatively high value of TN = 130 K is influenced by orbital ordering [ 11 ]  In addition  JT distortion in Ba2NdMoO6 influences magnetic ordering  though the relations between magnetic order and orbital are slight [ 12  13 ]  In Ba2NaOsO6  the JT distortion is not obvious  where the degeneracy of the track leads to weak ferromagnetic order  A similar compound  Ba2LiOsO6 is AFM indicating a fairly good balance between the two compounds  In respect of 4d/5d metal  the spin-orbit coupling and spin delocalization covalently bonded by the bond are significantly improved compared with the 3d metal  Therefore  the magnetic moment of the 4d/5d element is significantly brought down  just as some compounds with Ru [ 14 ]  It is particularly interesting that because of its powerful SOC  Ir5+ compounds ( Ba2HoIrO6 or R2NaIrO6 ) shows neither magnetic ordering of the Ir sublattic nor reduced moment at Ir  The reason is explained that the great SOC lifts the t2g orbital degeneracy and creates a nonmagnetic ground state  even though the Ir5+ ions with typical low-spin d4 are expected to be paramagnetic  In so far as R2LiIrO6  the nonmagnetic ground state was found for Ir  while magnetic properties are resulted from the R ions  However  an Ir set the stage for the magnetic properties was found at higher temperatures  At low temperature  a nonmagnetic ground state of Ir is observed in R2LiIrO6 while the magnetic properties are ascribed to R ions at A-site  Nevertheless  Ir contributes to magnetic properties when the temperature gets higher  Structural distortions can quench the effect of SOC as it does in the case of Sr2YIrO6  In addition  most of the reported A2B′BʺX6 perovskites with magnetic ordering are AFM  and some AFM order of more than 200 compounds has been reported  A single B′ or Bʺ cation forms a face-centered cubic ( FCC ) lattice  and when magnetic cations of this FCC array shows up  a few common types of magnetic ordering are found  These are three types of orderings shown in Fig  2  The types of I  II  and III are relied on the relative strengths of the NN and NNN of magnetic ions  Type I is found under the condition of stronger NN interactions than the NNN ones  where eight of the twelve NN cations are ordered AFM while the other NNN cations all ordered FM  We can easily find type II when the NNN interaction is more significant than the NN interaction  Type III is an intermediate form with relatively strong NN interactions and apparent NNN interactions  Similar to type I  eight of the twelve NN cations are ordered AFM  but two of the six NNN cations are ordered AFM [ 15 ]  Fig  2 figure 2 ( Reprinted with permission from Ref  [ 15 ]  Copyright 1999  Published by The American Physical Society ) Common orderings of A2B′B″O6 antiferromagnetic perovskites : a type I  b type II and c type III [ 15 ]  Full size image Magnetic properties lean on the orbital overlap of spatial ions while the overlap leans on the structure  For instance  the interaction of TC and bandwidth which is estimated by bond length and angle has been established in the compound of A′AʺFeMoO6 with A′  Aʺ = Ca  Ba or Sr Comparably  a linear dependence between TN values and electronic bandwidth is found for some other Mo or W compounds  Due to the presence of CMR  perovskite manganese oxide has a strong core electronic system  and strong interactions within the electron lead to complex electronic properties and magnetic properties [ 16 ]  The rich physics involving manganese oxides  such as phase separation [ 17 ]  charge ordering ( CO )  and semi-metallicity  make it one of the highlights in the field of condensed matter physics along with many prototype devices designed and development of scientific research and formulation technology  At present  nanoscale perovskite manganite has vast development potential and broad market prospects  There are various applications in magnetism such as magnetic refrigeration  bio-processing  and miniaturized magnetic sensor applications  A large number of researches make clear that as the size is reduced to the nanometer scale strong rearranges  the magnetic properties of perovskite manganite will change dramatically  including large coercivities and surface spin-glass ( SG ) [ 18 ]  According to the scientists  when the particle size of perovskite manganate drops to the nanometer level  the spin core–shell structure is easily observed  In this process  the nature of the core is similar to the nature of the homologous sample  while the core has a large number of crystal defects leading to ineffective rotation of the core  leading to the appearance of magnetic dead layers  In addition  as the particle size decreases  the surface effect of the shell becomes stronger  At the same time  scientists have concluded that the surface super-exchange interaction is conducive to the development of the FM core [ 19 ]  For instance  nanosized FM manganite La067Ca033MnO3 ( LCMO ) exhibits a reduced saturated magnetization with smaller grain size  On account of the magnetic properties of perovskite manganite  scientists put forward the core–shell model nanoparticles  where the core exists the original nature and the magnetic properties of the shell make a difference  The thickness of the shell is approximately 3 nm ; this magnetic dead layer has been detected to exist along with the FM crystalline core [ 20 ]  Nevertheless  for the core–shell structure of La025Ca075MnO3  the temperature of the CO transition gradually decreases and the pyramid becomes wide and weak as the grain size decreases  Pyramid  FM becomes the CG state [ 21 ]  This phenomenon involves endless rotation of the grain size while improving the FM interaction and suppressing the AFM state  Nevertheless  for the core–shell structure of La025Ca075MnO3  the temperature of the CO transition gradually decreases and the pyramid becomes wide and weak as the grain size decreases [ 21 ]  This phenomenon involves endless rotation of the grain size while improving the FM interaction and suppressing the AFM state  Phan and Yu [ 22 ] reviewed the RCP of various perovskite materials and summarized that compositions of La0845Sr0155MnO3  La0815Sr0185MnO3  La07Ca025Sr005MnO3  Gd5Si2Ge2  and Pr063Sr037MnO3 contributed the highest RCP values of 670  533  462  535  and 511 J/kg in turn  In the report  some additional compositions such as HoMnO3  La06Ca04MnO3  Pr08Na02MnO3  Pr08Na015K005MnO3  Pr08Na01K01MnO3  and Pr08Na005K015MnO3 have performed the RCP of 540  508  356  326  292  and 293 J/kg  In addition  facile cooling power was contributed by the rest of manganites  For Yb09Er01MnO3 and Yb08Er02MnO3 with higher value of ∆H  this cooling power is increased [ 23 ]  3 Electronic Properties The electronic structures of perovskites are determined by BX6 blocks  of which are near the band edge in particular  For example  the Pb 6s-I 5p-antibonding orbital of the [ PbI6 ] 4− units settles the valence band while the Pb 6p-I 5p σ-antibonding and Pb 6p-I 5s σ-antibonding orbitals control the conduction band [ 24 ]  The unique electronic properties of perovskite materials are essentially induced by lone pairs of lead ions  Unlike the electronic properties of most cations  Pb has an electron orbit that occupies 6 s below the top of valence band ( VB ) [ 25 ]  The valence band maximum ( VBM ) has a stable antibonding interaction between I and Pb  Due to the special ionic and covalent nature of the electronic structure in perovskite materials  conduction band minimum ( CBM ) is mainly caused by the Pb state  As shown in Fig  3  the electronic properties of the perovskite are attributed to the molecular structure of the perovskite material and to each ion  Like the perovskite structure of MAPbI3  the iodide ion produces VB at the A-site  while the iodide ion produces a conduction band at the B-site  Fig  3 figure 3 ( Reprinted with permission from Ref  [ 27 ]  Copyright 2015  Published by Royal Society of Chemistry ) a Contributions of MA  Pb  and I on the density of state of MAPbI3 perovskite [ 26 ] ( Reprinted with permission from Ref  [ 26 ]  Copyright 2014  Published by Springer Nature )  Schematic optical absorption of b perovskite  c Si and d GaAs [ 27 ] ) Full size image As can be seen from Fig  3a  the density distribution of the different ions can have an effect on the electronic properties of the perovskite material  We can conclude that the cation-related state density is very low compared to VBM  which has no effect on the electronic band structure  The unique electronic structures of perovskites are displayed in Fig  3  in contrast with the first and second generation  taking the Si and GaAs solar cell as examples  In traditional semiconductors  the CBM mainly depends on s orbital while the VBM on p orbital [ 27 ]  However  halide perovskite exhibits an inverted electronic band structure  leading to strong optical absorption compared with the first-and second-generation semiconductors  Compared with the previous absorber  perovskite materials are direct bandgap semiconductors and its transition possibility is much higher than others  Although both MAPbI3 and GaAs have direct bandgap  their electronic structures are quite different  First  the bottom end of the conduction band ( CB ) of the perovskite material is determined by the Pb b band  Instead  the lower end of the CB is determined by the delocalized s orbit of GaAs  Thus  the perovskite material has a higher state density ( Fig  4a ) and a combined density of states ( Fig  4b )  On the other hand  the band transition between CB and VB originates from the mixed halides of Pb s and I p to Pb p orbitals  The possible transition from Pb s to Pb p is higher than that of GaAs  as the ability of optical absorption for perovskites is much stronger than that of GaAs ( see in Fig  4c  d ) ( Fig  5 )  Fig  4 figure 4 ( Reprinted with permission from Ref  [ 27 ]  Copyright 2015

uniqueness of perovskites is the electrically benign grain boundary ( GB )  Different from the conventional polycrystalline GBs that are noxious for performance  the GBs of perovskite polycrystalline films are usually invisible [ 29 ]  which has been reported to benefit the device performance [ 30 ]  There is a stable interaction between Pb s and I p  resulting in a higher VBM  Therefore  there are lower defect states and charge carrier recombination [ 27 ]  Due to the specific electronic structure  the perovskite material has strong carrier transport and carrier collection properties  which is advantageous for electronic performance  [ 27  31  32 ]  By solution method engineering  perovskite films with high quality can be produced  For example  the mobility of MAPbI3 thin film can be enhanced by four magnitude ( 8–35 cm2 V−1 s−1 ) through optimized deposition techniques [ 33 ]  At the same time  the diffusion length of the perovskite material varies with the preparation method  The relationship between the electronic properties of the perovskite material and the crystal structure can be seen from Fig  2  As shown in Table 1  it can be clearly seen that various measurement methods and material compositions result in the electronic properties of the perovskite  When the phase of perovskite transforms to a cubic structure at room temperature  electronic properties are relatively reduced  Table 1 Diffusion length and mobility of some hybrid perovskites Full size table 4 Optical Properties Perovskites are under intense research for the use in optoelectronics  not only in solar cells but also light detectors [ 414243 ] and light-emitting diodes ( LEDs ) [ 44  45 ]  This can be attributed to their excellent optical properties which are absolutely requested for the light absorbers as well as light-emitting materials  for example  the high absorption coefficients and tunable direct bandgaps  The large absorption coefficients on the order of 105 cm−1 make it possible to reduce the thickness of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites  which means easy fabrication and low cost  Therefore  the thicknesses of TiO2 in perovskite are relatively low compared to the solid-state dye sensitized solar cells  This may encourage the development and commercialization of perovskite solar cells to some extent  According to Shockley and Queisser ( SQ ) calculations  the upper limit for solar energy conversion efficiency using single-junction solar cell is close to 33 % at 14 eV absorber energy bandgap  In spite of this  the recorded efficiencies of single-junction solar cells can hardly achieve the upper limit  Different kinds of adverse factors including defects  impurities  interfacial potential barriers  put off the approaching of the theoretical maximum  Figure 6 [ 46 ] gives the detailed description of the relationship between the maximum power conversion efficiency and the bandgap of absorber materials along with the recorded efficiencies by experiments  We can see that as the bandgap of absorber materials shifts away from the ideal value of 14 eV  the limit of maximal power conversion efficiency will decrease  Fig  6 figure 6 ( Reprinted

technologies [ 46 ] Full size image It is known that perovskite materials can be described as ABX3  where X is an anion and A and B are cations of different sizes  For the organic-inorganic halide perovskites of present interest  the larger cation A is organic group  It is generally methylammonium ethylammonium  and formamidinium  For efficient cells  cation B has universally been Pb2+ or Sn2+  The anion X is a halogen  generally iodine ( I− )  bromine ( Br− ) and chlorine ( Cl− )  A remarkable versatility of perovskite is the tunability of the optical energy band through all of these compositions of A  B  and X  There are three kinds of structures of bulk perovskite that we usually observe : cubic  tetragonal  and orthorhombic  in order of decreasing symmetry  In general  once the size of the A cation is reduced  the structure would evolve from the original tetragonal symmetric structure to cubic symmetry [ 47 ]  The increased symmetry can make differences in the bandgap  On the other hand  the band structure of the perovskite is primarily dependent on the inorganic components  For example  in MAPbI3  its valence band maxima originate from the σ bonding orbital composed of Pb 6s–I 5p  The conduction band minima consist of Pb 6p–I 5s σ and Pb 6p–I 5p π antibonding orbitals [ 48 ]  Therefore  the bandgap is mainly determined by the [ PbI6 ] 4−  which is also confirmed by the first principles modeling [ 49 ]  The cation A plays an important role in the phase structure of perovskites based on the empirical Goldschmidt tolerance_factor theory  which is usually accompanied by the change in bandgap  In cubic perovskite structures  the alternation on A can still tailor the band structure to a small extent  For example  the bandgap of archetypal hybrid perovskite MAPbI3 is around 15 eV  To narrow the bandgap of MAPbI3 closer to 14 eV   a similar group to has been applied  forming FAPbI3 with a bandgap of 14 eV and significantly extended photocurrent generation spectrum at 870 nm  As for the CsPbI3  the bandgap is in the range of 167 eV  The tendency has been described that with the increase in the size of A  like from Cs+ to MA+ or FA+  the value of the bandgap will gradually decrease ( Fig  7 )  However  further increasing the size of A to EA  the perovskite structure turns into orthorhombic symmetry with a larger bandgap of 22 eV [ 50 ]  According to the structural formation criterion  the volume threshold is CH3CH2NH2 for the formation of cubic APbI3  From this point  there are quite a limited number of molecules that can be applied in the A-position to modulate the band structures of perovskites  Fig  7 figure 7 ( Reprinted with permission from Ref  [ 47 ]  Copyright 2014  Published by RSC Pub ) Energy levels for some perovskites  TiO2 and a conventional hole transporting material  2  2′  7  7′-tetrakis- ( N  N-dimethoxyphenyl-amine- ) -9  9′-spirobifluorene ( spiro-MeOTAD )  The values under the chemical formula are the corresponding bandgap in eV [ 47 ] Full size image However  the change of B and X in ABX3 gives more considerable changes in bandgap  To avoid toxic lead ( Pb )  the development of lead-free or lead-less perovskite materials has attracted more and more interest all over the world  Tin ( Sn )  which is in the same family as Pb  is the first candidate as the alternative  Ogomi et al  [ 51 ] observed that the bandgap of MASn1−xPbxI3 can be tuned between 117 and 155 eV along with the absorption spectrum extended from the visible to the near-infrared region  The first demonstration of the lead-free MASnI3 perovskite came from Hao et al  [ 52 ]  With the narrowed bandgap of 13 eV  the PCE of this tin-based perovskite solar cell was over 5 %  Nevertheless  the biggest problem to deal with the MASn1−xPbxI3 or MASnI3 perovskite is yet to solve  It is difficult to prevent the oxidation of Sn to SnI4 in the iodide perovskite  What is more  the low surface coverage and low crystal quality of Sn-based perovskite also cause low efficiency of the cell devices compared with the Pb equivalents  In the X position of perovskites  halogen elements  Cl  Br  and I  are used mostly  The alternation of X can bring great changes in their bandgaps  For MAPbX3  the bandgaps of Cl  Br  and I are 311  220  and 150 eV  respectively ( see in Fig  7 )  Figure 8 [ 38  53  54 ] shows the continuous change of absorption spectra of different perovskite materials with mixed halides  The works on altering A and X simultaneously represented exhibited similar results [ 55 ]  Substitution of B and X in Fig  7 at the same time shows a large range of bandgap modulation which is from 110 to 311 eV  This tunability could be useful for multijunction perovskite solar cells or hybrid tandem solar cells with silicon or copper indium gallium diselenide ( CIGS ) thin films in pursuit of higher energy conversion efficiency  Fig  8 figure 8 ( Reprinted with permission from Ref  [ 38 ]

quantum dots ( QDs )  are usually revealed to be different from the commonly mentioned three-dimension ( 3D ) materials  Analogously  with quantum confinement effect  the 2D-nanostructrued perovskites and QDs perovskites show variable absorption edges and PL peak positions  in addition to better air- and photo-stability than the 3D ones  Taking advantage of defect tolerance  perovskite QDs exhibit unique optical properties in spite of the nature of intrinsic structural defects which are abundant in this system  These defects do not act as traps as the other compounds  Nearly all types of perovskite QDs  including the organic-inorganic hybrid and the all-inorganic materials  have been reported in recent years  What is more  the perovskite colloidal nanocrystals ( NCs ) offer highly saturated colors compared with the CIE ( Fig  9c ) [ 56  57 ]  By adjusting the composition of X and A as well as the size and shape of these NCs  their photoluminescence ( PL ) peaks move in a continuous way  Like the CH3NH3PbX3 NCs  the wide-color gamut and tunable color range are desirable  which can be seen in Fig  9a  b [ 57 ]  At room temperature  the perovskite NCs are synthesized as the phases as follows : MAPbI3 NCs are tetragonal ; FAPbBr3  MAPbBr3  and FAPbI3 NCs are cubic ; CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 NCs are orthorhombic  The narrow emission bandwidths  high photoluminescence quantum efficiency ( PLQY )  and tunable PL peak positions ( from ultraviolet to near-infrared ) of perovskite NCs meet the requirement for wide-color-gamut liquid-crystal displays ( LCDs )  Fig  9 figure 9 (

present numerous advantages in electronic  magnetic  and optical properties  In the last few years  because of the strong electron–electron interaction with the 3d manifold and considerable physical strength  scientists have paid a great deal of attention to magnetic properties of perovskite materials  especially B-site substituted perovskite and perovskite manganite  The B-site substituted perovskites are a great playground for magnetic properties  as various combinations of different paramagnetic cations are possible at all of the three cation sites  allowing for a wide range of magnetic behaviors  Perovskite manganites have a wide range of magnetic properties  such as colossal multiferroic property  magnetocaloric effect  and magnetoresistance  There are various applications in magnetism such as magnetic refrigeration  bioprocessing  and miniaturized magnetic sensor applications  In addition  the electronic structure of perovskite materials is predominantly determined by the BX6 ions  while the distinctive electronic character of perovskite materials is basically induced by the lone pair of lead ions  Moreover  one of the remarkable aspects of halide perovskites is that the grain boundaries are electrically benign  Therefore  it is promising to produce high-quality semiconductor films from solution processing methods for various photoelectric devices  2 Magnetic Properties Recently  because of the discovery of B-site substituted perovskite oxides A2B′B″X6 and nanoscale manganese-based perovskite oxides ( AMnO3 ) which have colossal magnetoresistance  the studies of magnetic properties of perovskite materials have attracted a great deal of attention  They are used in the areas of sensors  catalysts  magneto-optical materials  fuels cells  et al  Because of their unusual magnetic properties  recently there has been particular interest in the case of transition metal perovskite oxides  These perovskite oxides have special magnetic properties due to the strong electron–electron interaction with the 3d manifold and a considerable physical strength [ 1 ]  For instance  Cai reported that half-metallic ferromagnetism leads to giant magneto-optical Kerr effects in the BiNiO3 with the orthorhombic structure  In the Hessler compound PtMnSb  Kerr rotation reached 128° at 187 eV  which is compared to the accepted maximum polarity Kerr rotation of 135° at 175 eV  The great p-d exchange influences half-metallic ferromagnetism with the semiconducting majority-spin electrons and the metallic minority-spin electrons  leading to large Kerr rotation of BiNiO3 finally [ 2 ]  The perovskite structure has the compositional flexibility and excellent structue  Recently  half of the B-site cations have attracted a lot of attention  and these cations have been replaced by another cation  In this case  Bʹ and B″ may keep disordered  or they can order at the B-site  forming a so-called A2BʹB″X6  of which B-site ordered double perovskite  There are three ways that the B-site cations ordered  the structure increases the modifiability and complexity of the perovskite compounds  as shown in Fig  1  In addition  the two different cations existing in B-site leads to novel and interesting combinations  ranging from 3d  4d  or 5d transition metals from actinoides and lanthanoides to main group elements  whose oxidation states are various  Because of the fact that B-site cations determine the magnetic order and electrical conductivity of A2BʹB″X6  potential new materials with each cation combination and ordering can be ensured in a wide range  Fig  1 figure 1 ( Reprinted with permission from Ref  [ 3 ]  Copyright 2010  Published by The Royal Society of Chemistry ) The B-site cation combinations of A2B′B″X6 perovskites : a rock-salt  b layered and c columnar order [ 3 ] Full size image The double perovskites are of good magnetic properties  For the reason that various combinations of paramagnetic cations are able to fit in these cation sites of A2BʹB″X6  a large number of magnetic performances can be achieved  Although some compounds are antiferromagnetic ( AFM )  a variety of ferromagnetic ( FM ) or ferrimagnetic ( FiM ) compounds have been found in A2BʹB″X6 perovskite ” compared to other oxides  Some have very high magnetic ordering temperature ( TC )  In addition  considering the magnetic properties  the degree of cation order is very important  The spin-glass behavior has been observed with significant long-range magnetic properties in several disordered compounds  For example  low-dimensional magnetic properties have been found in JT distorted A2CuB″X6  In so far as a single paramagnetic B-site cation in the A2BʹB “ X6 perovskite  the super-exchange interaction occurs over a relatively long distance  What is interesting is that the strength of the 90° B″–O– ( B′ ) –O–B″nearest-neighbor ( NN ) interactions and the 180° B′–O–B″–O–B′ next-nearest-neighbor ( NNN ) interactions can often be of the same order  and can compete  The relative strength of these interactions depends on the nature of the paramagnetic ions  For example  it has been noted that the 90° B′–O–O–B′ interactions are stronger compared to 180° B′–O–B″–O–B′ in certain Ru compounds  due to the fact that the  eg  orbitals of Ru are empty  so only π-interactions possible [ 4 ]  Similarly we would expect compounds with full t2g orbitals and half-filled  eg  orbitals to have relatively stronger 180° interactions  In case of two magnetic B-site cations  things are a bit more complicated  There may be short-range B′–O–B″ interactions between the B-site cations  as well as long-range B′–O– ( B″ ) –O–B′ and B″–O– ( B′ ) –O–B″ ones  It would perhaps be expected that the short-range B′–O–B″ interactions would be the strongest interaction in the system  dominating the magnetic ordering  However  in A2B′B″X6 perovskites  the B″–O– ( B′ ) –O–B″ superexchange interactions may sometimes be stronger than B′–O–B″ interactions  due to weaker energetic orbital overlap of the two different B-site cations  This has been shown for example in case of Sr2CoOsO6  where the two B-cation sublattices order independently and at different temperatures [ 5 ]  Several compounds with B′ = R and B″ = transition metal  such as various A2RRuO6 compounds  Sr2TbIrO6 and Ba2NdOsO6  show the same behavior of the two B-cation sublattices ordering at different temperatures  Apparently  the orbital mixing between the lantanoides and the transition metals is weak enough that the long-range superexchange interactions dominate the magnetic ordering  The energetic overlap of the two B-site cation orbitals is often poor in the A2B′B″O6 perovskites  Thus  it could be relatively common for the long-range B′–O– ( B″ ) –O–B′ superexchange to be stronger than the short B′–O–B″ interaction in these compounds  It is also possible to place paramagnetic cations at the A-position of the A2B′BʺO6 perovskite  Compounds having Mn2+ or paramagnetic R in A-position are well-known  In this case  between A and B-site cations  there is possibly a magnetic coupling  For instance  Mn and Fe of Mn2FeSbO6 are spin-coupled to produce an elliptical spin helix with a disproportionate propagation vector [ 6 ]  The paramagnetic ions are also likely to occupy all three cation sites  such as Nd2NiMnO6  in which Ni and Mn order FM to each other at 200 K while Nd is ordered AFM to the B-site cations at 45 K [ 7 ]  However  the interaction between the A and B cations is usually very weak  For example  in R2LiRuO6  the Ru–O– ( Li ) –O–Ru interaction is stronger than the R–O–R or R–O–Ru interaction [ 8 ]  This may be mainly because of the weak orbital mixing of lanthanide and transition metal elements  It is interesting to point out that Pb in A-site can improve magnetic properties because of the super-exchange interactions of electrons in Pb 6s [ 9 ]  Comparing with Pb or Sr in A-site  it has been found that the magnetic temperatures of A2BʹNbO6  A2NiReO6  A2MnWO6  and A2FeTiO6 are higher [ 10 ]  JT distortion due to d1 configuration is rare but has been found in A2B ’ BʺX6 perovskites occasionally  In the case of Ba2SmMoO6  both JT distortion coincides and TN appears  where the relatively high value of TN = 130 K is influenced by orbital ordering [ 11 ]  In addition  JT distortion in Ba2NdMoO6 influences magnetic ordering  though the relations between magnetic order and orbital are slight [ 12  13 ]  In Ba2NaOsO6  the JT distortion is not obvious  where the degeneracy of the track leads to weak ferromagnetic order  A similar compound  Ba2LiOsO6 is AFM indicating a fairly good balance between the two compounds  In respect of 4d/5d metal  the spin-orbit coupling and spin delocalization covalently bonded by the bond are significantly improved compared with the 3d metal  Therefore  the magnetic moment of the 4d/5d element is significantly brought down  just as some compounds with Ru [ 14 ]  It is particularly interesting that because of its powerful SOC  Ir5+ compounds ( Ba2HoIrO6 or R2NaIrO6 ) shows neither magnetic ordering of the Ir sublattic nor reduced moment at Ir  The reason is explained that the great SOC lifts the t2g orbital degeneracy and creates a nonmagnetic ground state  even though the Ir5+ ions with typical low-spin d4 are expected to be paramagnetic  In so far as R2LiIrO6  the nonmagnetic ground state was found for Ir  while magnetic properties are resulted from the R ions  However  an Ir set the stage for the magnetic properties was found at higher temperatures  At low temperature  a nonmagnetic ground state of Ir is observed in R2LiIrO6 while the magnetic properties are ascribed to R ions at A-site  Nevertheless  Ir contributes to magnetic properties when the temperature gets higher  Structural distortions can quench the effect of SOC as it does in the case of Sr2YIrO6  In addition  most of the reported A2B′BʺX6 perovskites with magnetic ordering are AFM  and some AFM order of more than 200 compounds has been reported  A single B′ or Bʺ cation forms a face-centered cubic ( FCC ) lattice  and when magnetic cations of this FCC array shows up  a few common types of magnetic ordering are found  These are three types of orderings shown in Fig  2  The types of I  II  and III are relied on the relative strengths of the NN and NNN of magnetic ions  Type I is found under the condition of stronger NN interactions than the NNN ones  where eight of the twelve NN cations are ordered AFM while the other NNN cations all ordered FM  We can easily find type II when the NNN interaction is more significant than the NN interaction  Type III is an intermediate form with relatively strong NN interactions and apparent NNN interactions  Similar to type I  eight of the twelve NN cations are ordered AFM  but two of the six NNN cations are ordered AFM [ 15 ]  Fig  2 figure 2 ( Reprinted with permission from Ref  [ 15 ]  Copyright 1999  Published by The American Physical Society ) Common orderings of A2B′B″O6 antiferromagnetic perovskites : a type I  b type II and c type III [ 15 ]  Full size image Magnetic properties lean on the orbital overlap of spatial ions while the overlap leans on the structure  For instance  the interaction of TC and bandwidth which is estimated by bond length and angle has been established in the compound of A′AʺFeMoO6 with A′  Aʺ = Ca  Ba or Sr Comparably  a linear dependence between TN values and electronic bandwidth is found for some other Mo or W compounds  Due to the presence of CMR  perovskite manganese oxide has a strong core electronic system  and strong interactions within the electron lead to complex electronic properties and magnetic properties [ 16 ]  The rich physics involving manganese oxides  such as phase separation [ 17 ]  charge ordering ( CO )  and semi-metallicity  make it one of the highlights in the field of condensed matter physics along with many prototype devices designed and development of scientific research and formulation technology  At present  nanoscale perovskite manganite has vast development potential and broad market prospects  There are various applications in magnetism such as magnetic refrigeration  bio-processing  and miniaturized magnetic sensor applications  A large number of researches make clear that as the size is reduced to the nanometer scale strong rearranges  the magnetic properties of perovskite manganite will change dramatically  including large coercivities and surface spin-glass ( SG ) [ 18 ]  According to the scientists  when the particle size of perovskite manganate drops to the nanometer level  the spin core–shell structure is easily observed  In this process  the nature of the core is similar to the nature of the homologous sample  while the core has a large number of crystal defects leading to ineffective rotation of the core  leading to the appearance of magnetic dead layers  In addition  as the particle size decreases  the surface effect of the shell becomes stronger  At the same time  scientists have concluded that the surface super-exchange interaction is conducive to the development of the FM core [ 19 ]  For instance  nanosized FM manganite La067Ca033MnO3 ( LCMO ) exhibits a reduced saturated magnetization with smaller grain size  On account of the magnetic properties of perovskite manganite  scientists put forward the core–shell model nanoparticles  where the core exists the original nature and the magnetic properties of the shell make a difference  The thickness of the shell is approximately 3 nm ; this magnetic dead layer has been detected to exist along with the FM crystalline core [ 20 ]  Nevertheless  for the core–shell structure of La025Ca075MnO3  the temperature of the CO transition gradually decreases and the pyramid becomes wide and weak as the grain size decreases  Pyramid  FM becomes the CG state [ 21 ]  This phenomenon involves endless rotation of the grain size while improving the FM interaction and suppressing the AFM state  Nevertheless  for the core–shell structure of La025Ca075MnO3  the temperature of the CO transition gradually decreases and the pyramid becomes wide and weak as the grain size decreases [ 21 ]  This phenomenon involves endless rotation of the grain size while improving the FM interaction and suppressing the AFM state  Phan and Yu [ 22 ] reviewed the RCP of various perovskite materials and summarized that compositions of La0845Sr0155MnO3  La0815Sr0185MnO3  La07Ca025Sr005MnO3  Gd5Si2Ge2  and Pr063Sr037MnO3 contributed the highest RCP values of 670  533  462  535  and 511 J/kg in turn  In the report  some additional compositions such as HoMnO3  La06Ca04MnO3  Pr08Na02MnO3  Pr08Na015K005MnO3  Pr08Na01K01MnO3  and Pr08Na005K015MnO3 have performed the RCP of 540  508  356  326  292  and 293 J/kg  In addition  facile cooling power was contributed by the rest of manganites  For Yb09Er01MnO3 and Yb08Er02MnO3 with higher value of ∆H  this cooling power is increased [ 23 ]  3 Electronic Properties The electronic structures of perovskites are determined by BX6 blocks  of which are near the band edge in particular  For example  the Pb 6s-I 5p-antibonding orbital of the [ PbI6 ] 4− units settles the valence band while the Pb 6p-I 5p σ-antibonding and Pb 6p-I 5s σ-antibonding orbitals control the conduction band [ 24 ]  The unique electronic properties of perovskite materials are essentially induced by lone pairs of lead ions  Unlike the electronic properties of most cations  Pb has an electron orbit that occupies 6 s below the top of valence band ( VB ) [ 25 ]  The valence band maximum ( VBM ) has a stable antibonding interaction between I and Pb  Due to the special ionic and covalent nature of the electronic structure in perovskite materials  conduction band minimum ( CBM ) is mainly caused by the Pb state  As shown in Fig  3  the electronic properties of the perovskite are attributed to the molecular structure of the perovskite material and to each ion  Like the perovskite structure of MAPbI3  the iodide ion produces VB at the A-site  while the iodide ion produces a conduction band at the B-site  Fig  3 figure 3 ( Reprinted with permission from Ref  [ 27 ]  Copyright 2015  Published by Royal Society of Chemistry ) a Contributions of MA  Pb  and I on the density of state of MAPbI3 perovskite [ 26 ] ( Reprinted with permission from Ref  [ 26 ]  Copyright 2014  Published by Springer Nature )  Schematic optical absorption of b perovskite  c Si and d GaAs [ 27 ] ) Full size image As can be seen from Fig  3a  the density distribution of the different ions can have an effect on the electronic properties of the perovskite material  We can conclude that the cation-related state density is very low compared to VBM  which has no effect on the electronic band structure  The unique electronic structures of perovskites are displayed in Fig  3  in contrast with the first and second generation  taking the Si and GaAs solar cell as examples  In traditional semiconductors  the CBM mainly depends on s orbital while the VBM on p orbital [ 27 ]  However  halide perovskite exhibits an inverted electronic band structure  leading to strong optical absorption compared with the first-and second-generation semiconductors  Compared with the previous absorber  perovskite materials are direct bandgap semiconductors and its transition possibility is much higher than others  Although both MAPbI3 and GaAs have direct bandgap  their electronic structures are quite different  First  the bottom end of the conduction band ( CB ) of the perovskite material is determined by the Pb b band  Instead  the lower end of the CB is determined by the delocalized s orbit of GaAs  Thus  the perovskite material has a higher state density ( Fig  4a ) and a combined density of states ( Fig  4b )  On the other hand  the band transition between CB and VB originates from the mixed halides of Pb s and I p to Pb p orbitals  The possible transition from Pb s to Pb p is higher than that of GaAs  as the ability of optical absorption for perovskites is much stronger than that of GaAs ( see in Fig  4c  d ) ( Fig  5 )  Fig  4 figure 4 ( Reprinted with permission from Ref  [ 27 ]  Copyright 2015

uniqueness of perovskites is the electrically benign grain boundary ( GB )  Different from the conventional polycrystalline GBs that are noxious for performance  the GBs of perovskite polycrystalline films are usually invisible [ 29 ]  which has been reported to benefit the device performance [ 30 ]  There is a stable interaction between Pb s and I p  resulting in a higher VBM  Therefore  there are lower defect states and charge carrier recombination [ 27 ]  Due to the specific electronic structure  the perovskite material has strong carrier transport and carrier collection properties  which is advantageous for electronic performance  [ 27  31  32 ]  By solution method engineering  perovskite films with high quality can be produced  For example  the mobility of MAPbI3 thin film can be enhanced by four magnitude ( 8–35 cm2 V−1 s−1 ) through optimized deposition techniques [ 33 ]  At the same time  the diffusion length of the perovskite material varies with the preparation method  The relationship between the electronic properties of the perovskite material and the crystal structure can be seen from Fig  2  As shown in Table 1  it can be clearly seen that various measurement methods and material compositions result in the electronic properties of the perovskite  When the phase of perovskite transforms to a cubic structure at room temperature  electronic properties are relatively reduced  Table 1 Diffusion length and mobility of some hybrid perovskites Full size table 4 Optical Properties Perovskites are under intense research for the use in optoelectronics  not only in solar cells but also light detectors [ 414243 ] and light-emitting diodes ( LEDs ) [ 44  45 ]  This can be attributed to their excellent optical properties which are absolutely requested for the light absorbers as well as light-emitting materials  for example  the high absorption coefficients and tunable direct bandgaps  The large absorption coefficients on the order of 105 cm−1 make it possible to reduce the thickness of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites  which means easy fabrication and low cost  Therefore  the thicknesses of TiO2 in perovskite are relatively low compared to the solid-state dye sensitized solar cells  This may encourage the development and commercialization of perovskite solar cells to some extent  According to Shockley and Queisser ( SQ ) calculations  the upper limit for solar energy conversion efficiency using single-junction solar cell is close to 33 % at 14 eV absorber energy bandgap  In spite of this  the recorded efficiencies of single-junction solar cells can hardly achieve the upper limit  Different kinds of adverse factors including defects  impurities  interfacial potential barriers  put off the approaching of the theoretical maximum  Figure 6 [ 46 ] gives the detailed description of the relationship between the maximum power conversion efficiency and the bandgap of absorber materials along with the recorded efficiencies by experiments  We can see that as the bandgap of absorber materials shifts away from the ideal value of 14 eV  the limit of maximal power conversion efficiency will decrease  Fig  6 figure 6 ( Reprinted

technologies [ 46 ] Full size image It is known that perovskite materials can be described as ABX3  where X is an anion and A and B are cations of different sizes  For the organic-inorganic halide perovskites of present interest  the larger cation A is organic group  It is generally methylammonium ethylammonium  and formamidinium  For efficient cells  cation B has universally been Pb2+ or Sn2+  The anion X is a halogen  generally iodine ( I− )  bromine ( Br− ) and chlorine ( Cl− )  A remarkable versatility of perovskite is the tunability of the optical energy band through all of these compositions of A  B  and X  There are three kinds of structures of bulk perovskite that we usually observe : cubic  tetragonal  and orthorhombic  in order of decreasing symmetry  In general  once the size of the A cation is reduced  the structure would evolve from the original tetragonal symmetric structure to cubic symmetry [ 47 ]  The increased symmetry can make differences in the bandgap  On the other hand  the band structure of the perovskite is primarily dependent on the inorganic components  For example  in MAPbI3  its valence band maxima originate from the σ bonding orbital composed of Pb 6s–I 5p  The conduction band minima consist of Pb 6p–I 5s σ and Pb 6p–I 5p π antibonding orbitals [ 48 ]  Therefore  the bandgap is mainly determined by the [ PbI6 ] 4−  which is also confirmed by the first principles modeling [ 49 ]  The cation A plays an important role in the phase structure of perovskites based on the empirical Goldschmidt tolerance_factor theory  which is usually accompanied by the change in bandgap  In cubic perovskite structures  the alternation on A can still tailor the band structure to a small extent  For example  the bandgap of archetypal hybrid perovskite MAPbI3 is around 15 eV  To narrow the bandgap of MAPbI3 closer to 14 eV   a similar group to has been applied  forming FAPbI3 with a bandgap of 14 eV and significantly extended photocurrent generation spectrum at 870 nm  As for the CsPbI3  the bandgap is in the range of 167 eV  The tendency has been described that with the increase in the size of A  like from Cs+ to MA+ or FA+  the value of the bandgap will gradually decrease ( Fig  7 )  However  further increasing the size of A to EA  the perovskite structure turns into orthorhombic symmetry with a larger bandgap of 22 eV [ 50 ]  According to the structural formation criterion  the volume threshold is CH3CH2NH2 for the formation of cubic APbI3  From this point  there are quite a limited number of molecules that can be applied in the A-position to modulate the band structures of perovskites  Fig  7 figure 7 ( Reprinted with permission from Ref  [ 47 ]  Copyright 2014  Published by RSC Pub ) Energy levels for some perovskites  TiO2 and a conventional hole transporting material  2  2′  7  7′-tetrakis- ( N  N-dimethoxyphenyl-amine- ) -9  9′-spirobifluorene ( spiro-MeOTAD )  The values under the chemical formula are the corresponding bandgap in eV [ 47 ] Full size image However  the change of B and X in ABX3 gives more considerable changes in bandgap  To avoid toxic lead ( Pb )  the development of lead-free or lead-less perovskite materials has attracted more and more interest all over the world  Tin ( Sn )  which is in the same family as Pb  is the first candidate as the alternative  Ogomi et al  [ 51 ] observed that the bandgap of MASn1−xPbxI3 can be tuned between 117 and 155 eV along with the absorption spectrum extended from the visible to the near-infrared region  The first demonstration of the lead-free MASnI3 perovskite came from Hao et al  [ 52 ]  With the narrowed bandgap of 13 eV  the PCE of this tin-based perovskite solar cell was over 5 %  Nevertheless  the biggest problem to deal with the MASn1−xPbxI3 or MASnI3 perovskite is yet to solve  It is difficult to prevent the oxidation of Sn to SnI4 in the iodide perovskite  What is more  the low surface coverage and low crystal quality of Sn-based perovskite also cause low efficiency of the cell devices compared with the Pb equivalents  In the X position of perovskites  halogen elements  Cl  Br  and I  are used mostly  The alternation of X can bring great changes in their bandgaps  For MAPbX3  the bandgaps of Cl  Br  and I are 311  220  and 150 eV  respectively ( see in Fig  7 )  Figure 8 [ 38  53  54 ] shows the continuous change of absorption spectra of different perovskite materials with mixed halides  The works on altering A and X simultaneously represented exhibited similar results [ 55 ]  Substitution of B and X in Fig  7 at the same time shows a large range of bandgap modulation which is from 110 to 311 eV  This tunability could be useful for multijunction perovskite solar cells or hybrid tandem solar cells with silicon or copper indium gallium diselenide ( CIGS ) thin films in pursuit of higher energy conversion efficiency  Fig  8 figure 8 ( Reprinted with permission from Ref  [ 38 ]

quantum dots ( QDs )  are usually revealed to be different from the commonly mentioned three-dimension ( 3D ) materials  Analogously  with quantum confinement effect  the 2D-nanostructrued perovskites and QDs perovskites show variable absorption edges and PL peak positions  in addition to better air- and photo-stability than the 3D ones  Taking advantage of defect tolerance  perovskite QDs exhibit unique optical properties in spite of the nature of intrinsic structural defects which are abundant in this system  These defects do not act as traps as the other compounds  Nearly all types of perovskite QDs  including the organic-inorganic hybrid and the all-inorganic materials  have been reported in recent years  What is more  the perovskite colloidal nanocrystals ( NCs ) offer highly saturated colors compared with the CIE ( Fig  9c ) [ 56  57 ]  By adjusting the composition of X and A as well as the size and shape of these NCs  their photoluminescence ( PL ) peaks move in a continuous way  Like the CH3NH3PbX3 NCs  the wide-color gamut and tunable color range are desirable  which can be seen in Fig  9a  b [ 57 ]  At room temperature  the perovskite NCs are synthesized as the phases as follows : MAPbI3 NCs are tetragonal ; FAPbBr3  MAPbBr3  and FAPbI3 NCs are cubic ; CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 NCs are orthorhombic  The narrow emission bandwidths  high photoluminescence quantum efficiency ( PLQY )  and tunable PL peak positions ( from ultraviolet to near-infrared ) of perovskite NCs meet the requirement for wide-color-gamut liquid-crystal displays ( LCDs )  Fig  9 figure 9 (

perovskite can cover the virtues of both 2D- and 3D-perovskite  being an aggregate of desirable photo-electronic properties as well as the stability against moisture  Fig  10 figure 10 ( Reprinted

present numerous advantages in electronic  magnetic  and optical properties  In the last few years  because of the strong electron–electron interaction with the 3d manifold and considerable physical strength  scientists have paid a great deal of attention to magnetic properties of perovskite materials  especially B-site substituted perovskite and perovskite manganite  The B-site substituted perovskites are a great playground for magnetic properties  as various combinations of different paramagnetic cations are possible at all of the three cation sites  allowing for a wide range of magnetic behaviors  Perovskite manganites have a wide range of magnetic properties  such as colossal multiferroic property  magnetocaloric effect  and magnetoresistance  There are various applications in magnetism such as magnetic refrigeration  bioprocessing  and miniaturized magnetic sensor applications  In addition  the electronic structure of perovskite materials is predominantly determined by the BX6 ions  while the distinctive electronic character of perovskite materials is basically induced by the lone pair of lead ions  Moreover  one of the remarkable aspects of halide perovskites is that the grain boundaries are electrically benign  Therefore  it is promising to produce high-quality semiconductor films from solution processing methods for various photoelectric devices  2 Magnetic Properties Recently  because of the discovery of B-site substituted perovskite oxides A2B′B″X6 and nanoscale manganese-based perovskite oxides ( AMnO3 ) which have colossal magnetoresistance  the studies of magnetic properties of perovskite materials have attracted a great deal of attention  They are used in the areas of sensors  catalysts  magneto-optical materials  fuels cells  et al  Because of their unusual magnetic properties  recently there has been particular interest in the case of transition metal perovskite oxides  These perovskite oxides have special magnetic properties due to the strong electron–electron interaction with the 3d manifold and a considerable physical strength [ 1 ]  For instance  Cai reported that half-metallic ferromagnetism leads to giant magneto-optical Kerr effects in the BiNiO3 with the orthorhombic structure  In the Hessler compound PtMnSb  Kerr rotation reached 128° at 187 eV  which is compared to the accepted maximum polarity Kerr rotation of 135° at 175 eV  The great p-d exchange influences half-metallic ferromagnetism with the semiconducting majority-spin electrons and the metallic minority-spin electrons  leading to large Kerr rotation of BiNiO3 finally [ 2 ]  The perovskite structure has the compositional flexibility and excellent structue  Recently  half of the B-site cations have attracted a lot of attention  and these cations have been replaced by another cation  In this case  Bʹ and B″ may keep disordered  or they can order at the B-site  forming a so-called A2BʹB″X6  of which B-site ordered double perovskite  There are three ways that the B-site cations ordered  the structure increases the modifiability and complexity of the perovskite compounds  as shown in Fig  1  In addition  the two different cations existing in B-site leads to novel and interesting combinations  ranging from 3d  4d  or 5d transition metals from actinoides and lanthanoides to main group elements  whose oxidation states are various  Because of the fact that B-site cations determine the magnetic order and electrical conductivity of A2BʹB″X6  potential new materials with each cation combination and ordering can be ensured in a wide range  Fig  1 figure 1 ( Reprinted with permission from Ref  [ 3 ]  Copyright 2010  Published by The Royal Society of Chemistry ) The B-site cation combinations of A2B′B″X6 perovskites : a rock-salt  b layered and c columnar order [ 3 ] Full size image The double perovskites are of good magnetic properties  For the reason that various combinations of paramagnetic cations are able to fit in these cation sites of A2BʹB″X6  a large number of magnetic performances can be achieved  Although some compounds are antiferromagnetic ( AFM )  a variety of ferromagnetic ( FM ) or ferrimagnetic ( FiM ) compounds have been found in A2BʹB″X6 perovskite ” compared to other oxides  Some have very high magnetic ordering temperature ( TC )  In addition  considering the magnetic properties  the degree of cation order is very important  The spin-glass behavior has been observed with significant long-range magnetic properties in several disordered compounds  For example  low-dimensional magnetic properties have been found in JT distorted A2CuB″X6  In so far as a single paramagnetic B-site cation in the A2BʹB “ X6 perovskite  the super-exchange interaction occurs over a relatively long distance  What is interesting is that the strength of the 90° B″–O– ( B′ ) –O–B″nearest-neighbor ( NN ) interactions and the 180° B′–O–B″–O–B′ next-nearest-neighbor ( NNN ) interactions can often be of the same order  and can compete  The relative strength of these interactions depends on the nature of the paramagnetic ions  For example  it has been noted that the 90° B′–O–O–B′ interactions are stronger compared to 180° B′–O–B″–O–B′ in certain Ru compounds  due to the fact that the  eg  orbitals of Ru are empty  so only π-interactions possible [ 4 ]  Similarly we would expect compounds with full t2g orbitals and half-filled  eg  orbitals to have relatively stronger 180° interactions  In case of two magnetic B-site cations  things are a bit more complicated  There may be short-range B′–O–B″ interactions between the B-site cations  as well as long-range B′–O– ( B″ ) –O–B′ and B″–O– ( B′ ) –O–B″ ones  It would perhaps be expected that the short-range B′–O–B″ interactions would be the strongest interaction in the system  dominating the magnetic ordering  However  in A2B′B″X6 perovskites  the B″–O– ( B′ ) –O–B″ superexchange interactions may sometimes be stronger than B′–O–B″ interactions  due to weaker energetic orbital overlap of the two different B-site cations  This has been shown for example in case of Sr2CoOsO6  where the two B-cation sublattices order independently and at different temperatures [ 5 ]  Several compounds with B′ = R and B″ = transition metal  such as various A2RRuO6 compounds  Sr2TbIrO6 and Ba2NdOsO6  show the same behavior of the two B-cation sublattices ordering at different temperatures  Apparently  the orbital mixing between the lantanoides and the transition metals is weak enough that the long-range superexchange interactions dominate the magnetic ordering  The energetic overlap of the two B-site cation orbitals is often poor in the A2B′B″O6 perovskites  Thus  it could be relatively common for the long-range B′–O– ( B″ ) –O–B′ superexchange to be stronger than the short B′–O–B″ interaction in these compounds  It is also possible to place paramagnetic cations at the A-position of the A2B′BʺO6 perovskite  Compounds having Mn2+ or paramagnetic R in A-position are well-known  In this case  between A and B-site cations  there is possibly a magnetic coupling  For instance  Mn and Fe of Mn2FeSbO6 are spin-coupled to produce an elliptical spin helix with a disproportionate propagation vector [ 6 ]  The paramagnetic ions are also likely to occupy all three cation sites  such as Nd2NiMnO6  in which Ni and Mn order FM to each other at 200 K while Nd is ordered AFM to the B-site cations at 45 K [ 7 ]  However  the interaction between the A and B cations is usually very weak  For example  in R2LiRuO6  the Ru–O– ( Li ) –O–Ru interaction is stronger than the R–O–R or R–O–Ru interaction [ 8 ]  This may be mainly because of the weak orbital mixing of lanthanide and transition metal elements  It is interesting to point out that Pb in A-site can improve magnetic properties because of the super-exchange interactions of electrons in Pb 6s [ 9 ]  Comparing with Pb or Sr in A-site  it has been found that the magnetic temperatures of A2BʹNbO6  A2NiReO6  A2MnWO6  and A2FeTiO6 are higher [ 10 ]  JT distortion due to d1 configuration is rare but has been found in A2B ’ BʺX6 perovskites occasionally  In the case of Ba2SmMoO6  both JT distortion coincides and TN appears  where the relatively high value of TN = 130 K is influenced by orbital ordering [ 11 ]  In addition  JT distortion in Ba2NdMoO6 influences magnetic ordering  though the relations between magnetic order and orbital are slight [ 12  13 ]  In Ba2NaOsO6  the JT distortion is not obvious  where the degeneracy of the track leads to weak ferromagnetic order  A similar compound  Ba2LiOsO6 is AFM indicating a fairly good balance between the two compounds  In respect of 4d/5d metal  the spin-orbit coupling and spin delocalization covalently bonded by the bond are significantly improved compared with the 3d metal  Therefore  the magnetic moment of the 4d/5d element is significantly brought down  just as some compounds with Ru [ 14 ]  It is particularly interesting that because of its powerful SOC  Ir5+ compounds ( Ba2HoIrO6 or R2NaIrO6 ) shows neither magnetic ordering of the Ir sublattic nor reduced moment at Ir  The reason is explained that the great SOC lifts the t2g orbital degeneracy and creates a nonmagnetic ground state  even though the Ir5+ ions with typical low-spin d4 are expected to be paramagnetic  In so far as R2LiIrO6  the nonmagnetic ground state was found for Ir  while magnetic properties are resulted from the R ions  However  an Ir set the stage for the magnetic properties was found at higher temperatures  At low temperature  a nonmagnetic ground state of Ir is observed in R2LiIrO6 while the magnetic properties are ascribed to R ions at A-site  Nevertheless  Ir contributes to magnetic properties when the temperature gets higher  Structural distortions can quench the effect of SOC as it does in the case of Sr2YIrO6  In addition  most of the reported A2B′BʺX6 perovskites with magnetic ordering are AFM  and some AFM order of more than 200 compounds has been reported  A single B′ or Bʺ cation forms a face-centered cubic ( FCC ) lattice  and when magnetic cations of this FCC array shows up  a few common types of magnetic ordering are found  These are three types of orderings shown in Fig  2  The types of I  II  and III are relied on the relative strengths of the NN and NNN of magnetic ions  Type I is found under the condition of stronger NN interactions than the NNN ones  where eight of the twelve NN cations are ordered AFM while the other NNN cations all ordered FM  We can easily find type II when the NNN interaction is more significant than the NN interaction  Type III is an intermediate form with relatively strong NN interactions and apparent NNN interactions  Similar to type I  eight of the twelve NN cations are ordered AFM  but two of the six NNN cations are ordered AFM [ 15 ]  Fig  2 figure 2 ( Reprinted with permission from Ref  [ 15 ]  Copyright 1999  Published by The American Physical Society ) Common orderings of A2B′B″O6 antiferromagnetic perovskites : a type I  b type II and c type III [ 15 ]  Full size image Magnetic properties lean on the orbital overlap of spatial ions while the overlap leans on the structure  For instance  the interaction of TC and bandwidth which is estimated by bond length and angle has been established in the compound of A′AʺFeMoO6 with A′  Aʺ = Ca  Ba or Sr Comparably  a linear dependence between TN values and electronic bandwidth is found for some other Mo or W compounds  Due to the presence of CMR  perovskite manganese oxide has a strong core electronic system  and strong interactions within the electron lead to complex electronic properties and magnetic properties [ 16 ]  The rich physics involving manganese oxides  such as phase separation [ 17 ]  charge ordering ( CO )  and semi-metallicity  make it one of the highlights in the field of condensed matter physics along with many prototype devices designed and development of scientific research and formulation technology  At present  nanoscale perovskite manganite has vast development potential and broad market prospects  There are various applications in magnetism such as magnetic refrigeration  bio-processing  and miniaturized magnetic sensor applications  A large number of researches make clear that as the size is reduced to the nanometer scale strong rearranges  the magnetic properties of perovskite manganite will change dramatically  including large coercivities and surface spin-glass ( SG ) [ 18 ]  According to the scientists  when the particle size of perovskite manganate drops to the nanometer level  the spin core–shell structure is easily observed  In this process  the nature of the core is similar to the nature of the homologous sample  while the core has a large number of crystal defects leading to ineffective rotation of the core  leading to the appearance of magnetic dead layers  In addition  as the particle size decreases  the surface effect of the shell becomes stronger  At the same time  scientists have concluded that the surface super-exchange interaction is conducive to the development of the FM core [ 19 ]  For instance  nanosized FM manganite La067Ca033MnO3 ( LCMO ) exhibits a reduced saturated magnetization with smaller grain size  On account of the magnetic properties of perovskite manganite  scientists put forward the core–shell model nanoparticles  where the core exists the original nature and the magnetic properties of the shell make a difference  The thickness of the shell is approximately 3 nm ; this magnetic dead layer has been detected to exist along with the FM crystalline core [ 20 ]  Nevertheless  for the core–shell structure of La025Ca075MnO3  the temperature of the CO transition gradually decreases and the pyramid becomes wide and weak as the grain size decreases  Pyramid  FM becomes the CG state [ 21 ]  This phenomenon involves endless rotation of the grain size while improving the FM interaction and suppressing the AFM state  Nevertheless  for the core–shell structure of La025Ca075MnO3  the temperature of the CO transition gradually decreases and the pyramid becomes wide and weak as the grain size decreases [ 21 ]  This phenomenon involves endless rotation of the grain size while improving the FM interaction and suppressing the AFM state  Phan and Yu [ 22 ] reviewed the RCP of various perovskite materials and summarized that compositions of La0845Sr0155MnO3  La0815Sr0185MnO3  La07Ca025Sr005MnO3  Gd5Si2Ge2  and Pr063Sr037MnO3 contributed the highest RCP values of 670  533  462  535  and 511 J/kg in turn  In the report  some additional compositions such as HoMnO3  La06Ca04MnO3  Pr08Na02MnO3  Pr08Na015K005MnO3  Pr08Na01K01MnO3  and Pr08Na005K015MnO3 have performed the RCP of 540  508  356  326  292  and 293 J/kg  In addition  facile cooling power was contributed by the rest of manganites  For Yb09Er01MnO3 and Yb08Er02MnO3 with higher value of ∆H  this cooling power is increased [ 23 ]  3 Electronic Properties The electronic structures of perovskites are determined by BX6 blocks  of which are near the band edge in particular  For example  the Pb 6s-I 5p-antibonding orbital of the [ PbI6 ] 4− units settles the valence band while the Pb 6p-I 5p σ-antibonding and Pb 6p-I 5s σ-antibonding orbitals control the conduction band [ 24 ]  The unique electronic properties of perovskite materials are essentially induced by lone pairs of lead ions  Unlike the electronic properties of most cations  Pb has an electron orbit that occupies 6 s below the top of valence band ( VB ) [ 25 ]  The valence band maximum ( VBM ) has a stable antibonding interaction between I and Pb  Due to the special ionic and covalent nature of the electronic structure in perovskite materials  conduction band minimum ( CBM ) is mainly caused by the Pb state  As shown in Fig  3  the electronic properties of the perovskite are attributed to the molecular structure of the perovskite material and to each ion  Like the perovskite structure of MAPbI3  the iodide ion produces VB at the A-site  while the iodide ion produces a conduction band at the B-site  Fig  3 figure 3 ( Reprinted with permission from Ref  [ 27 ]  Copyright 2015  Published by Royal Society of Chemistry ) a Contributions of MA  Pb  and I on the density of state of MAPbI3 perovskite [ 26 ] ( Reprinted with permission from Ref  [ 26 ]  Copyright 2014  Published by Springer Nature )  Schematic optical absorption of b perovskite  c Si and d GaAs [ 27 ] ) Full size image As can be seen from Fig  3a  the density distribution of the different ions can have an effect on the electronic properties of the perovskite material  We can conclude that the cation-related state density is very low compared to VBM  which has no effect on the electronic band structure  The unique electronic structures of perovskites are displayed in Fig  3  in contrast with the first and second generation  taking the Si and GaAs solar cell as examples  In traditional semiconductors  the CBM mainly depends on s orbital while the VBM on p orbital [ 27 ]  However  halide perovskite exhibits an inverted electronic band structure  leading to strong optical absorption compared with the first-and second-generation semiconductors  Compared with the previous absorber  perovskite materials are direct bandgap semiconductors and its transition possibility is much higher than others  Although both MAPbI3 and GaAs have direct bandgap  their electronic structures are quite different  First  the bottom end of the conduction band ( CB ) of the perovskite material is determined by the Pb b band  Instead  the lower end of the CB is determined by the delocalized s orbit of GaAs  Thus  the perovskite material has a higher state density ( Fig  4a ) and a combined density of states ( Fig  4b )  On the other hand  the band transition between CB and VB originates from the mixed halides of Pb s and I p to Pb p orbitals  The possible transition from Pb s to Pb p is higher than that of GaAs  as the ability of optical absorption for perovskites is much stronger than that of GaAs ( see in Fig  4c  d ) ( Fig  5 )  Fig  4 figure 4 ( Reprinted with permission from Ref  [ 27 ]  Copyright 2015

uniqueness of perovskites is the electrically benign grain boundary ( GB )  Different from the conventional polycrystalline GBs that are noxious for performance  the GBs of perovskite polycrystalline films are usually invisible [ 29 ]  which has been reported to benefit the device performance [ 30 ]  There is a stable interaction between Pb s and I p  resulting in a higher VBM  Therefore  there are lower defect states and charge carrier recombination [ 27 ]  Due to the specific electronic structure  the perovskite material has strong carrier transport and carrier collection properties  which is advantageous for electronic performance  [ 27  31  32 ]  By solution method engineering  perovskite films with high quality can be produced  For example  the mobility of MAPbI3 thin film can be enhanced by four magnitude ( 8–35 cm2 V−1 s−1 ) through optimized deposition techniques [ 33 ]  At the same time  the diffusion length of the perovskite material varies with the preparation method  The relationship between the electronic properties of the perovskite material and the crystal structure can be seen from Fig  2  As shown in Table 1  it can be clearly seen that various measurement methods and material compositions result in the electronic properties of the perovskite  When the phase of perovskite transforms to a cubic structure at room temperature  electronic properties are relatively reduced  Table 1 Diffusion length and mobility of some hybrid perovskites Full size table 4 Optical Properties Perovskites are under intense research for the use in optoelectronics  not only in solar cells but also light detectors [ 414243 ] and light-emitting diodes ( LEDs ) [ 44  45 ]  This can be attributed to their excellent optical properties which are absolutely requested for the light absorbers as well as light-emitting materials  for example  the high absorption coefficients and tunable direct bandgaps  The large absorption coefficients on the order of 105 cm−1 make it possible to reduce the thickness of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites  which means easy fabrication and low cost  Therefore  the thicknesses of TiO2 in perovskite are relatively low compared to the solid-state dye sensitized solar cells  This may encourage the development and commercialization of perovskite solar cells to some extent  According to Shockley and Queisser ( SQ ) calculations  the upper limit for solar energy conversion efficiency using single-junction solar cell is close to 33 % at 14 eV absorber energy bandgap  In spite of this  the recorded efficiencies of single-junction solar cells can hardly achieve the upper limit  Different kinds of adverse factors including defects  impurities  interfacial potential barriers  put off the approaching of the theoretical maximum  Figure 6 [ 46 ] gives the detailed description of the relationship between the maximum power conversion efficiency and the bandgap of absorber materials along with the recorded efficiencies by experiments  We can see that as the bandgap of absorber materials shifts away from the ideal value of 14 eV  the limit of maximal power conversion efficiency will decrease  Fig  6 figure 6 ( Reprinted

technologies [ 46 ] Full size image It is known that perovskite materials can be described as ABX3  where X is an anion and A and B are cations of different sizes  For the organic-inorganic halide perovskites of present interest  the larger cation A is organic group  It is generally methylammonium ethylammonium  and formamidinium  For efficient cells  cation B has universally been Pb2+ or Sn2+  The anion X is a halogen  generally iodine ( I− )  bromine ( Br− ) and chlorine ( Cl− )  A remarkable versatility of perovskite is the tunability of the optical energy band through all of these compositions of A  B  and X  There are three kinds of structures of bulk perovskite that we usually observe : cubic  tetragonal  and orthorhombic  in order of decreasing symmetry  In general  once the size of the A cation is reduced  the structure would evolve from the original tetragonal symmetric structure to cubic symmetry [ 47 ]  The increased symmetry can make differences in the bandgap  On the other hand  the band structure of the perovskite is primarily dependent on the inorganic components  For example  in MAPbI3  its valence band maxima originate from the σ bonding orbital composed of Pb 6s–I 5p  The conduction band minima consist of Pb 6p–I 5s σ and Pb 6p–I 5p π antibonding orbitals [ 48 ]  Therefore  the bandgap is mainly determined by the [ PbI6 ] 4−  which is also confirmed by the first principles modeling [ 49 ]  The cation A plays an important role in the phase structure of perovskites based on the empirical Goldschmidt tolerance_factor theory  which is usually accompanied by the change in bandgap  In cubic perovskite structures  the alternation on A can still tailor the band structure to a small extent  For example  the bandgap of archetypal hybrid perovskite MAPbI3 is around 15 eV  To narrow the bandgap of MAPbI3 closer to 14 eV   a similar group to has been applied  forming FAPbI3 with a bandgap of 14 eV and significantly extended photocurrent generation spectrum at 870 nm  As for the CsPbI3  the bandgap is in the range of 167 eV  The tendency has been described that with the increase in the size of A  like from Cs+ to MA+ or FA+  the value of the bandgap will gradually decrease ( Fig  7 )  However  further increasing the size of A to EA  the perovskite structure turns into orthorhombic symmetry with a larger bandgap of 22 eV [ 50 ]  According to the structural formation criterion  the volume threshold is CH3CH2NH2 for the formation of cubic APbI3  From this point  there are quite a limited number of molecules that can be applied in the A-position to modulate the band structures of perovskites  Fig  7 figure 7 ( Reprinted with permission from Ref  [ 47 ]  Copyright 2014  Published by RSC Pub ) Energy levels for some

are the corresponding bandgap in eV [ 47 ] Full size image However  the change of B and X in ABX3 gives more considerable changes in bandgap  To avoid toxic lead ( Pb )  the development of lead-free or lead-less perovskite materials has attracted more and more interest all over the world  Tin ( Sn )  which is in the same family as Pb  is the first candidate as the alternative  Ogomi et al  [ 51 ] observed that the bandgap of MASn1−xPbxI3 can be tuned between 117 and 155 eV along with the absorption spectrum extended from the visible to the near-infrared region  The first demonstration of the lead-free MASnI3 perovskite came from Hao et al  [ 52 ]  With the narrowed bandgap of 13 eV  the PCE of this tin-based perovskite solar cell was over 5 %  Nevertheless  the biggest problem to deal with the MASn1−xPbxI3 or MASnI3 perovskite is yet to solve  It is difficult to prevent the oxidation of Sn to SnI4 in the iodide perovskite  What is more  the low surface coverage and low crystal quality of Sn-based perovskite also cause low efficiency of the cell devices compared with the Pb equivalents  In the X position of perovskites  halogen elements  Cl  Br  and I  are used mostly  The alternation of X can bring great changes in their bandgaps  For MAPbX3  the bandgaps of Cl  Br  and I are 311  220  and 150 eV  respectively ( see in Fig  7 )  Figure 8 [ 38  53  54 ] shows the continuous change of absorption spectra of different perovskite materials with mixed halides  The works on altering A and X simultaneously represented exhibited similar results [ 55 ]  Substitution of B and X in Fig  7 at the same time shows a large range of bandgap modulation which is from 110 to 311 eV  This tunability could be useful for multijunction perovskite solar cells or hybrid tandem solar cells with silicon or copper indium gallium diselenide ( CIGS ) thin films in pursuit of higher energy conversion efficiency  Fig  8 figure 8 ( Reprinted with permission from Ref  [ 38 ]

quantum dots ( QDs )  are usually revealed to be different from the commonly mentioned three-dimension ( 3D ) materials  Analogously  with quantum confinement effect  the 2D-nanostructrued perovskites and QDs perovskites show variable absorption edges and PL peak positions  in addition to better air- and photo-stability than the 3D ones  Taking advantage of defect tolerance  perovskite QDs exhibit unique optical properties in spite of the nature of intrinsic structural defects which are abundant in this system  These defects do not act as traps as the other compounds  Nearly all types of perovskite QDs  including the organic-inorganic hybrid and the all-inorganic materials  have been reported in recent years  What is more  the perovskite colloidal nanocrystals ( NCs ) offer highly saturated colors compared with the CIE ( Fig  9c ) [ 56  57 ]  By adjusting the composition of X and A as well as the size and shape of these NCs  their photoluminescence ( PL ) peaks move in a continuous way  Like the CH3NH3PbX3 NCs  the wide-color gamut and tunable color range are desirable  which can be seen in Fig  9a  b [ 57 ]  At room temperature  the perovskite NCs are synthesized as the phases as follows : MAPbI3 NCs are tetragonal ; FAPbBr3  MAPbBr3  and FAPbI3 NCs are cubic ; CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 NCs are orthorhombic  The narrow emission bandwidths  high photoluminescence quantum efficiency ( PLQY )  and tunable PL peak positions ( from ultraviolet to near-infrared ) of perovskite NCs meet the requirement for wide-color-gamut liquid-crystal displays ( LCDs )  Fig  9 figure 9 (

perovskite Article 09 April 2019 1 Introduction After the first application of organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites in solar cells in 2009 [ 1 ]  the power conversion efficiency of perovskite-based photovoltaic cells has rapidly increased  Recently  such devices significantly gained higher stability owing to the development of novel perovskite materials [ 234 ]  Importantly  the solar cell performance not only depends on the properties of the perovskite absorber itself  but also on the charge transport materials that guide the flow of charges to the electrodes  These layers  prototypical conjugated organic materials being 22′77′-tetrakis ( N  N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine ) -99′-spirobifluorene ( spiro-MeOTAD ) or 66-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) [ 567 ]  are crucial for the selective extraction of holes and electrons  as well as for their transport to the electrodes  Although organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites have been identified as ambipolar charge conductors [ 89101112 ]  the insertion of such adjacent layers has been reported to be beneficial for device performance  particularly due to enhanced charge-transfer rate and reduced electron–hole recombination at the interface [ 13  14 ]  Clearly  not only must these transport layers meet structural criteria for optimal performance  but their energy levels also needs to match those of the perovskite absorber and thereby yield appropriate energy level offsets for electron and hole extraction  Such energy level alignment is influenced by any changes in the electronic properties of the perovskite layer as well  Organic charge transport layers can be deposited either by thermal evaporation or by solution processing  The latter case primarily requires an appropriate solvent  which can dissolve the transport material for deposition  and which preserves the perovskite layer when the charge transport material is deposited on top  Therefore  it is necessary to assess in detail possible effects of solvent exposure on the perovskite absorber film  In the present work  we systematically investigate the impact of four prototypical solvents on the structural and electronic properties of methyl ammonium lead mixed halide CH3NH3PbI3−xClx ( abbreviated by MAPbI3-xClx in the following ) perovskite films by means of grazing incidence x-ray diffraction ( GIXRD )  atomic force microscopy ( AFM )  ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy ( UV–Vis )  and photoelectron spectroscopy ( PES )  While individual groups may have investigated such aspects  pertinent reports are scarce  and we therefore deem it useful for the community to disseminate the present comprehensive study  We chose chlorobenzene ( CB ) and chloroform ( CF )  as they are usually employed in the solution deposition of charge transport materials such as spiro-MeOTAD or PCBM [ 567 ]  We contrast their impact to that of dimethylformamide ( DMF ) and water ( H2O ) as typical solvents for perovskites  It transpires that  although the structure of the perovskite film is not affected by CB and CF  the corresponding electronic properties of the film surface are altered significantly  Finally  our characterization of the impact of DMF and H2O exposure on the films  which instantly dissolve the perovskite  provides insights into possible degradation mechanisms upon exposure to polar solvents  2 Experimental section 21 Sample preparation The indium tin oxide ( ITO ) -coated glass substrates ( 10 mm × 10 mm ) were solvent cleaned and UV treated for 40 min before depositing poly ( 34-ethylenedioxythiophene ) /poly ( styrenesulfonate ) ( PEDOT : PSS ) ( AI4083 ) by spin coating at 40 rps for 30 s under ambient conditions  Thereafter  the PEDOT : PSS films were annealed in the glove box at 180 °C for 10 min  The perovskite films were prepared based on a methyl ammonium ( MA ) lead iodide chloride CH3NH3PbI3−xClx ( MAPbI3−xClx ) precursor solution of 40 wt %  prepared by dissolving MAI and PbCl2 in a molar ratio of 3:1 in N  N-dimethylformamide ( DMF ) and stirred at 60 °C overnight in a nitrogen-filled glove box  The MAPbI3−xClx layers were obtained by spin coating 25 μL of the precursor solution onto the PEDOT : PSS pre-covered ITO substrates before annealing at 100 °C for 100 min in the N2-glove box  22 Solvent exposure The solvent exposure consisted of the deposition of one drop ( ca  25 μL ) of chlorobenzene ( CB )  chloroform ( CF )  or N  N-dimethylformamide ( DMF )  or two drops ( ca  80 μL ) of water on the as-prepared MAPbI3−xClx perovskite films  After solvent deposition  the films were allowed to dry in ambient air at room temperature until they looked apparently dry  after 2–5 min for CB and CF  and up to 1–2 h for DMF and water  23 GIXRD measurements GIXRD data were acquired at the DIFFRACTION endstation of the beamline KMC-2 at the synchrotron radiation source BESSY II at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie GmbH ( HZB  Germany )  A primary beam wavelength of 01 nm and a Vantec 2000 area detector ( sample to detector distance : 336 mm ) were employed  The setup allowed the coverage of a range in reciprocal space of ca  2 Å−1 both in and qz direction without the need to move the sample  24 AFM measurements AFM measurements were performed using a Bruker setup by selecting the ScanAsyst mode based on the peak force tapping mode with the automated adjustments of the measurement parameters  The AFM data processing was performed with Gwyddion  25 UV–Vis measurements Absorption measurements were done with a Lambda 950 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer from Perkin Elmer Inc 26 PES measurements Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy ( UPS ) measurements were performed using a He-discharge UV source ( Omicron ) with excitation energy of 212 eV for UPS  X-ray photoemission spectroscopy ( XPS ) measurements were done using Al Kα X-ray source with excitation energy of 14866 eV  A Phoibos 100 ( Specs ) hemispherical analyzer was used to record the spectra  The base pressure in the analysis chamber was below 10−9 mbar  The as-prepared samples for PES were directly transferred from a N2-filled glove box into the analysis chamber without exposure to air  The valence region spectra and XPS core level spectra were recorded at a pass energy of 5 eV and 20 eV  respectively  The secondary electron cutoff ( SECO ) spectra were recorded at a pass energy of 2 eV and by applying a − 10 V sample bias  3 Crystal structure and morphology Solvent exposure was done by the deposition of defined solvent droplets ( of ca  25 μL per drop ) on the as-prepared perovskite films  The respective measurement was performed immediately thereafter when the film was dry again  ie  when the solvent apparently was fully evaporated  Figure 1 shows the 2D GIXRD patterns of the MAPbI3−xClx films before and after the respective solvent exposure  The as-prepared films show all features known for fully crystallized perovskite  where the diffraction ring at q = 1 Å−1 corresponds to its ( 110 ) crystal plane [ 11  15  16 ]  After CB and CF exposure ( Fig  1a  b  respectively )  no obvious change in the GIXRD patterns was observed within the error margin of the experiment  thus implying that CB and CF did not affect the crystal structure of the perovskite significantly  Importantly  no indication of the emergence of degradation products such as PbI2 was found [ 17 ]  In marked contrast  exposure to DMF and H2O ( Fig  1c  d  respectively ) led to dramatic changes in the GIXRD patterns  Upon exposure to DMF  the film instantly became apparently transparent due to the dissolution of the solid film  Notably  the corresponding GIXRD pattern after exposure in Fig  1c ( after solvent evaporation ) still exhibits the characteristic diffraction features assigned to perovskite  particularly that at q = 1 Å−1  However  the overall intensity of these features is significantly lower than in the case of the as-prepared film  Most likely  this is due to the incomplete re-crystallization of the film at room temperature  ie  the dissolved film partially crystallized again into perovskite while drying in ambient air at room temperature  This can also be seen by the visual inspection of a film after DMF exposure  which was significantly more transparent than the pristine film and only exhibited limited dark areas ( see also photograph of such a sample in Fig  3 )  Again  no evidence for crystalline degradation products was found for the film exposed to DMF  Fig  1 figure 1 2D GIXRD patterns of MAPbI3−xClx films before and after different solvents exposure : a chlorobenzene ( CB )  b chloroform ( CF )  c dimethylformamide ( DMF )  and d water ( H2O )  The pink and black rings in d are the simulated diffraction rings corresponding to PbI2 and to non-textured ITO Full size image Upon contact with H2O  the perovskite film readily turned yellow  The GIXRD measurement conducted after the film was apparently dry again shows that all features related to the perovskite structure had disappeared  and the GIXRD pattern exhibited instead a diffraction ring at q = 09 Å−1  which is characteristic of the ( 001 ) plane of PbI2 [ 15  18 ]  We note that no traces of monohydrate were observed  which would have been represented by a peak expected at q = 06 Å−1  Thus  this demonstrates the direct degradation into PbI2 without an intermediate phase upon exposure to liquid water  as it has been also observed before for perovskite films exposed to liquid water [ 19  20 ]  Figure 1d also shows the diffraction features corresponding to non-textured ITO  Given the surface sensitivity of GIXRD  this is indicative of a less homogeneous film after H2O exposure  To verify this indication and to assess changes in morphology upon solvent exposure  we characterized similarly prepared films by AFM before and after solvent exposure ( when they were apparently dry )  The corresponding micrographs are shown in Fig  2  After exposure to CB and CF  the perovskite films did not exhibit any relevant changes in morphology  as further supported by the comparable root-mean-square ( rms ) roughness of the films before and after exposure to these two solvents ( Fig  2a  b )  In comparison  significant changes were observed in the case of DMF and H2O exposure  as shown in Fig  2c  d  respectively  After DMF exposure  needle-like crystallites were observed with extended voids in between  which likely correspond to the underlying PEDOT : PSS substrate  H2O exposure led to the most significant changes in the film morphology  where large grains ( of widths up to a few micrometers ) occurred  that is  isolated aggregates  as also observed before [ 19 ]  In line with our GIXRD data ( vide supra )  the film exhibited lower coverage in comparison to the pristine perovskite film  likely related to PbI2  as inferred from the corresponding GIXRD feature  Fig  2 figure 2 AFM images of MAPbI3−xClx films before and after different solvents exposure : a CB  b CF  c DMF  and d H2O  Scan size is 50 μm × 50 μm ( top )  and 10 μm × 10 μm ( bottom )  respectively  Rq corresponds to the surface rms roughness Full size image Thus  in full agreement with the GIXRD results on the structure  our AFM data demonstrate that the film morphology is also not affected by CB and CF exposure  while DMF and H2O induce distinct deterioration of the film quality  It is noteworthy that the changes observed upon solvents exposure can already be expected based on the solvents ’ respective polarity  Indeed  solvents with high polarity can better dissolve compounds with ionic properties such as perovskites  For the selected solvents  the relative polarity of CB  CF  DMF  and water amounts to 0188  0259  0386  and 1  respectively [ 21 ]  Therefore  both polar solvents DMF and water can efficiently dissolve the perovskite films  In clear contrast  CB and CF  which are categorized as non-polar and water-immiscible solvents  do not dissolve the films  4 Optical and electronic properties In line with the AFM and GIXRD results  no significant changes in the absorption spectra were observed for samples exposed to CB and CF ( S1 and S2  respectively  in Fig  3a  b )  thus evidencing that the bulk optical properties of the perovskite films were not affected by these solvents  In marked contrast  the absorption spectrum upon DMF exposure ( S3 in Fig  3c ) exhibits a distinct decrease in absorbance over the whole visible region  Notably  a faint signal corresponding to the absorption edge of MAPbI3 at 158 eV is still visible  which is consistent with the signal associated with methyl ammonium lead iodide ( MAPbI3 ) perovskite detected by GIXRD in Fig  1  This implies the presence of re-crystallized perovskite already at room temperature  However  this perovskite re-crystallization is only partial  as evidenced by the loss of absorbance and the obviously more transparent films ( inset in Fig  3c for S3 + DMF )  Fig  3 figure 3 UV–Vis absorption spectra of MAPbI3−xClx films before and after different solvents exposure : a CB ( S1 )  b CF ( S2 )  c DMF ( S3 )  and d H2O ( S4 ) ; the insets depict photographs of the corresponding samples ( 10 mm × 10 mm ) after solvent exposure and total solvent evaporation Full size image An overall decrease in absorbance without any discernable perovskite absorption onset was recorded for the sample exposed to water in Fig  3d  The sample ( S4 + H2O ) exposed to water displayed a yellowish appearance ( see photograph in Fig  3d )  which supports the presence of PbI2  as already assessed by GIXRD  The lack of characteristic features in the broad absorption spectrum may be related to scattering effects due to the presence of the large  isolated grains observed by AFM  and to film inhomogeneities  as suggested by the GIXRD data  The electronic properties of the perovskite film surfaces upon exposure to the different solvents were investigated by UPS ( Fig  4 ) and XPS ( Fig  5 )  The work function of all samples increased after solvent exposure  as derived from the SECO spectra in Fig  4a  All valence region spectra also exhibited significant changes upon solvent exposure ( Fig  4b )  So far  the results indicated that the bulk optical and structural properties of the perovskite samples were preserved after exposure to CB and CF  Strikingly  however  the surface electronic structure as characterized by UPS was strongly affected by the CB and CF exposure  Notably  the shape of the valence band spectra changed significantly and the much fainter onset yields a valence band maximum ( VBM ) shift closer to EF by ca  05 eV and 02 eV for CB and CF  respectively ( Fig  4c  d  respectively )  These shifts are of the same magnitude as the respective work function increase  and and they all occur in the same direction as that of the respective core levels  as exemplarily shown for Pb 4f in Fig  5b  Therefore  these UPS data suggest that the surface became less n-type upon exposure to CB and CF  This evolution might be due to a reduction of defect states at the surface  Fig  4 figure 4 UPS spectra before ( S1  S2  S3  and S4 ) and after ( S1 + CB  S2 + CF  S3 + DMF  and S4 + H2O ) solvents exposure  a SECO spectra for work function

of S4 before H2O exposure and is shown as a reference  The blue and pink circles indicate some intensity corresponding to Pb0 Full size image The appearance of new features in the valence band region upon CB and CF exposure implies the modification of the surface  Since the morphology was not affected by the exposure to CB and CF  one could speculate about the degradation of perovskite into traces of the starting materials that imitate the initial surface morphology  However  the valence band spectra of PbI2 and MAI layers ( obtained from spin coating in DMF on ITO substrates ) do not resemble the data of solvent-exposed samples ( Fig  6 )  The new features at ca  6 and 8 eV  as well as the attenuation of the feature around 27 eV upon CB and CF exposure might instead be associated with mere surface contamination due to solvent residues on the surface  Fig  6 figure 6 UPS spectra of PbI2 and MAI films obtained by spin coating PbI2 and MAI  respectively  in DMF onto PEDOT : PSS pre-covered ITO substrates Full size image These results point out that care should be taken when choosing organic solvents for charge transport layer deposition on top of perovskites  Exposure to CB and CF do not affect the overall optical and structural bulk properties of the films but still substantially alter their surface electronic properties  Such effects indicate that non-polar solvents can still interact with the perovskite material  Moreover  we can not exclude that the observed alteration is mediated by impurities present in the solvents  For instance  non-controlled amount of water and oxygen in non-anhydrous CB and CF solvents—as in the case here—might readily impact the film properties  Indeed  it is important to recall that all exposure steps were carried out in ambient air and interestingly  the trend of the energy level shifts observed upon CB and CF exposure is similar to that observed for perovskite films upon pure oxygen or ambient air exposure [ 18 ]  This possibility would stress the importance of environment on the electronic properties of perovskites and motivate a closer attention to solvent purity  Still  the change in valence band shape together with the concomitant work function changes and VBM shifts suggest a surface modification that leads to a less n-type film character  the reason of which can not be fully resolved by the present data  In the case of the samples exposed to DMF and water  the respective valence band is dominated by features that correspond to the underlying PEDOT : PSS substrate as shown in Fig  4b for comparison  As UPS is a highly surface sensitive technique  the detection of such a signal from the substrate is in line with the reduced coverage in that case  as deduced from GIXRD and AFM  and is further corroborated by the S 2p core level spectra recorded for the samples after DMF and water exposure in Fig  5a ( S3 + DMF and D4 + H2O  respectively )  Additionally  DMF and H2O exposure led to the formation of Pb0  as shown by the intensity at lower binding energy observed in the corresponding Pb 4f spectra in Fig  5b  which indicates the degradation of perovskite  5 Conclusion Exposure of MAPbI3−xClx perovskite films to liquid DMF and water instantaneously dissolves the films  While the films exposed to DMF partially re-crystallize into perovskite already in ambient air at room temperature  the films exposed to water irreversibly degrade into PbI2  Additionally  the morphology of these films is characterized by large isolated aggregates that result in a poor film coverage  Contrastingly  CB and CF exposure affects neither the morphology nor the structural and optical bulk properties of the perovskite films  This supports the suitability of these two solvents for the deposition of organic charge transport layers  However  notably  the electronic properties of the perovskite surface are significantly affected by CB and CF exposure  The shape of the valence band  the change in work function and VBM shifts indicate a modification of surface states and a conversion to a less n-type surface  Such modification can substantially impact the perovskite properties at the interface to a charge transport material  Furthermore  although the important changes in electronic property observed here were induced by an appreciable amount of CB and CF  the results provoke the question of the possible impact of reduced or minute amount of solvents encountered in typical storage and preparation environments  such as glove boxes  on the electronic properties of perovskites  and hence  on the

Citations Explore all metrics Abstract Mesoscopic perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) usually show superior photovoltaic performance to their planar counterparts because of the mesoporous electron transport layers ( ETLs ) benefiting for perovskite crystal growth and electron transport  However  the preparation of high-quality mesoporous ETLs needs selecting sizable semiconductor nanocrystals commonly within 20–50 nm  smaller or larger nanocrystals will lead to either too narrow pores to effectively infiltrate perovskite materials or too small surface area to efficiently extract charges from perovskite materials  Using sizable semiconductor microspheres can solve the issue  whereas it is also not easy to synthesis sizable semiconductor microspheres  Here  a novel emulsion-based bottom-up self-assembly strategy is used to prepare small size ( about 150 nm ) TiO2 microspheres from ultra-small ( about 36 nm ) TiO2 nanocrystals  The as-prepared mesoscopic PSCs can yield a champion PCE as high as 1927 % with a much smaller current–voltage hysteresis compared with those of the planar one  Specially  the emulsion-based bottom-up self-assembly strategy is a general way for

Toward Effective Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells Article Open access 31 August 2023 Low-temperature sol-gel synthesized TiO2 with different titanium tetraisopropoxide ( TTIP ) molarity for flexible emerging solar cell Article 08 February 2024 1 Introduction Perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted many attentions because of the rapid development and achieved over 24 % certified power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) during the recent 10 years [ 1  2 ]  Owing to the supplied heterogeneous nucleation sites during the perovskite crystal growth and the enlarged charge separation area in the mesoporous electron transport layers ( ETLs )  the mesoscopic PSCs usually show high photovoltaic performance and achieve most of the highest certified PCEs during the different development periods of the PSCs [ 3  4 ]  High-quality mesoporous ETLs usually have sizable pores for effective infiltration of perovskite materials  large contact area with perovskite materials for efficient charge extraction  and defect-free interfaces with perovskite materials for suppressing charge recombination  Various n-type semiconductor nanocrystals including TiO2 [ 5 ]  SnO2 [ 6 ]  Nb2O5 [ 7 ]  BaSnO3 [ 8 ]  and so on have been used as ETLs for PSCs  among them TiO2 is one of the most widely used materials with high efficiency  The traditional TiO2 mesoporous ETLs are commonly fabricated with 20–50 nm TiO2 nanocrystals ( NCs )  smaller or larger TiO2 NCs are not suitable for preparing efficient devices because the smaller ones will induce too narrow pores to effectively infiltrate perovskite materials  and the larger ones also cause too small surface area to efficiently extract charges from perovskite materials  One effective way to overcome the above-mentioned issue is to use TiO2 microspheres  which compose numbers of small size TiO2 NCs and have porous structure  as building blocks for preparing high-quality mesoporous ETLs [ 9  10 ]  The TiO2 microspheres have been successfully used in fabricating high-efficient dye-sensitized solar cells [ 11 ]  However  comparing with the dye-sensitized solar cells with 10–15-µm-thick mesoporous TiO2 photoelectrodes  the efficient PSCs have much thinner mesoporous TiO2 ETLs in the range of 200–300 nm  so the TiO2 microspheres should be strictly controlled in small sizes  According to the former reports  the traditional methods for preparing TiO2 microspheres generally have sizes of 200–500 nm [ 12 ]  which are not suitable for preparing mesoporous ETLs of PSCs  Yang et al  reported successful synthesis of TiO2 microspheres with a diameter of 100 nm through rigid control of sol–gel reaction and fabricated mesoscopic PSCs with efficiency of 1841 % [ 13 ]  Here  we present a novel emulsion-based bottom-up self-assembly strategy to prepare small size ( about 150 nm ) TiO2 microspheres from ultra-small ( about 36 nm ) TiO2 NCs [ 14 ]  The mesoscopic PSCs with mesoporous TiO2 microspheres ( m-TiO2 ) ETLs achieve a champion PCE as high as 1927 % and a much smaller current–voltage ( J–V ) hysteresis ( the ratio of forward-scanned PCE/reverse-scanned PCE is 9476 % ) compared with those of the planar one ( 1790 % and 7346 %  respectively )  Consequently  the finding can effectively expand material selection range for preparing efficient mesoscopic PSCs  2 Experimental section 21 Preparation of TiO2 nanocrystals and TiO2 microspheres TiO2 NCs were synthesized according to the formerly reported method [ 5 ]  The as-prepared oleic acid ( OA ) -capped TiO2 NCs were used to prepare TiO2 microspheres with the emulsion-based bottom-up self-assembly strategy as shown in scheme 1a  The TiO2 NCs hexane solution ( 15 mg mL−1 ) was mixed with sodium dodecyl sulfate aqueous solution ( 150 mg mL−1 ) with volume ratio of 1/10 under ultrasonic irradiation ( 200 W  5 min )  The TiO2 microspheres were obtained by heating the mixture at 70 °C for 2 h  and then centrifuging at 10000 rpm for 10 min  Scheme 1 scheme 1 Schematic illustration of preparing TiO2 microspheres by the novel emulsion-based bottom-up self-assembly strategy ( a ) and a flowchart for illustrating the device construction process ( b ) Full size image 22 Device fabrication The mesosocpic PSCs with TiO2 microspheres ETLs ( m-TiO2 ETLs ) were prepared on the laser-patterned and cleared FTOs with size of 15 × 15 cm2  Firstly  the OA-capped TiO2 NCs toluene solution ( 20 mg mL−1 ) was spin-coated on FTOs at 4000 rpm for 30 s  soon afterwards heated at 500 °C for 30 min to form TiO2 NCs ETLs  Furthermore  the as-synthesized TiO2 microspheres dispersed in water ( 20 mg mL−1 ) was spin-coated on the as-prepared TiO2 NCs ETLs at 4000 rpm for 30 s  and then heated at 500 °C for 30 min to form m-TiO2 ETLs  The thickness of the ETLs was measured by a stylus profilometer ( D600  KLA Tencor  US )  Later  the perovskite layers with composition of Cs005 ( MA015FA085 ) 095Pb ( I085Br015 ) 3  the hole transport layers of Spiro-OMeTAD [ 22′77′-Tetrakis ( N  N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine ) -99′-spirobifluorene ]  and Au electrodes were prepared with the same methods as formerly reported [ 5 ]  as shown in Scheme 1b  These functional layers were also directly prepared on the TiO2 NCs ETLs to form planar ones for comparison  23 Characterization The SU8000 scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and JEM-2100 transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) were used to observe morphologies of the samples  A Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation ( λ = 015418 nm ) was used to detect the X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) patterns  The fluorescence spectrophotometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and Omin-λ Monochromator/Spectrograph ( Zolix ) with the time-correlated single-photon counting method ( Pico harp 300 ) were used to measure photoluminescence ( PL ) and time-resolved photoluminescence ( TRPL ) spectra  respectively  The current density–voltage ( J–V ) characteristic curves  incident-photo-to-current conversion efficiency ( IPCE ) curves  stabilized current density  and power output of PSCs were measured by the same methods as previously reported [ 5 ]  The electrochemical workstation ( Zahner  Germany ) was used to measure electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS ) data of the devices in the frequency ranging from 1 MHz to 01 Hz with a bias of − 10 V and under simulated AM 15 G and 100 mW cm−2 illumination  3 Results and discussion It is seen that the TiO2 NCs as shown in Fig  1a of TEM image have even sizes and are well dispersed without any aggregation  in consistent with our former report [ 15 ]  With the emulsion-based bottom-up self-assembly strategy  the TiO2 NCs can well assemble into microspheres with diameters about 150 nm  which are suitable for preparing mesoporous ETLs [ 13 ]  We can clearly observe the TiO2 NCs building blocks and mesoporous feature from the TEM image of one of the typical TiO2 microspheres as shown in Fig  1b  The SEM cross-sectional view of the mesoscopic PSC with m-TiO2 ETL as shown in Fig  1c reveals that the perovskite layer can well penetrate into the m-TiO2 ETL with good interfacial contact  The XRD patterns shown in Fig  1d demonstrate that the as-synthesized TiO2 NCs are anatase ( JCPDS # 21-1272 ) and the 500 °C thermal treatment can obviously enhance the crystallinity of both the TiO2 NCs and TiO2 microspheres  Fig  1 figure 1 TEM images of TiO2 NCs ( a ) and self-assembled microspheres ( b )  SEM cross-sectional view of the mesoscopic PSC with m-TiO2 ETL ( c )  XRD patterns of TiO2 NCs and TiO2 microspheres without and with 500 °C thermal treatment ( d ) Full size image Photovoltaic performance of the mesoscopic PSCs with m-TiO2 ETLs and the planar one with TiO2 NCs is shown in Fig  2  The J–V curves of Fig  2a reveal that through adjusting the spin-coating speed at 4000 rpm  the mesoscopic PSCs with m-TiO2 ETLs can achieve the best performance with a champion PCE as high as 1927 % ( Table 1 )  other samples prepared by slower or faster spin-coating speeds show decreased performance and even lower than the planar one  Owing to the relative big size of TiO2 microspheres  the different spin-coating speeds will result in obviously changed thickness of the m-TiO2 ETLs as listed in Table 1  and the photovoltaic performance of mesoscopic PSCs is very sensitive to the thickness of mesoporous ETLs [ 16 ]  resulting in obviously changed photovoltaic performance of the devices  Fig  2 figure 2 J–V curves of the mesoscopic PSCs with m-TiO2 ETLs prepared by spin-coating

mesoscopic PSC and the planar one measured by both forward and reverse scans ( the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 2 )  The optimized mesoscopic PSC has a reverse-scanned PCE ( forward-scanned PCE ) of 1927 % ( 1826 % ) and the ratio of forward-scanned PCE/reverse-scanned PCE is 9476 % ; whereas those of the planar ones are 1790 % ( 1315 % ) and 7346 %  Therefore  the optimized mesoscopic PSC shows not only enhanced photovoltaic performance but also greatly decreased J–V hysteresis compared with the planar one  The IPCE data as shown in Fig  2c are consistent with the J–V curves  Table 2 Photovoltaic parameters of the optimized mesoscopic PSC ( m-TiO2 ) and the planar one measured by forward and reverse scans  corresponding to the J–V curves shown in Fig  2b Full size table Figure 3a and b shows the steady-state output of Jsc and PCE of the optimized mesoscopic PSC and the planar one by tracking maximum power point ( MPP ) at a bias voltage  The optimized mesoscopic PSC can yield a stabilized PCE of 1903 % with a stabilized Jsc of 2108 mA cm−2  also both higher than the planar counterpart ( 1694 % and 1993 mA cm−2 )  Furthermore  for revealing reproducibility  the PCE distribution histograms of one batch of 30 devices of the optimized mesoscopic PSCs and the planar ones are shown in Fig  3c  One can find that the optimized mesoscopic PSCs yield a higher average PCE with a lower deviation compared with those of the planar ones [ 1848 ± 038 % versus 1702 ± 056 % ]  Fig  3 figure 3 Steady-state output of Jsc and PCE ( a and b )  and PCE distribution histograms ( c ) of the optimized mesoscopic PSC and the planar one Full size image Figure 4a shows the transmittance spectra of the TiO2 NCs and m-TiO2 ETLs prepared on FTOs  One can observe that the transmittance of the m-TiO2 ETL is lower than that of the TiO2 NCs ETL  whereas the decrement is within 4 %  so the m-TiO2 ETL can maintain relatively high transparency and will not obviously influence light absorption of the perovskite layer  The PL and TRPL spectra of the perovskite/m-TiO2 and perovskite/planar TiO2 films as shown in Fig  4b and c  respectively  are measured to reveal the different charge carrier dynamics in the mesoscopic PSC and the planar one  It is seen that the perovskite/m-TiO2 film has a higher PL quenching efficiency than that of the perovskite/planar TiO2 film because it shows a decreased PL intensity ( 1614 % decrement ) compared with the latter one ; the TRPL spectra have the same change tendency as that of PL spectra  The TRPL data shown in Fig  4c are fitted by the following bi-exponential equation [ 17 ] : Ileft ( t right ) = mathop sum limits_ { i } A_ { i } exp left ( { - t/tau_ { i } } right )  ( 1 ) Furthermore  the τavg is calculated with Ai and τi values as follows [ 18 ] : tau_ { text { avg } } = frac { { sum { A_ { i } tau_ { i } ^ { 2 } } } } { { sum { A_ { i } tau_ { i } } } }  ( 2 ) From Table 3  we can find that the perovskite/m-TiO2 film shows smaller τ1 ( 69 versus 85 ns ) and τavg ( 215 versus 291 ns ) than the perovskite/planar TiO2 film  indicating more efficient electron-extraction in the former one [ 19 ]  Fig  4 figure 4 Transmittance spectra of the TiO2 NCs and m-TiO2 ETLs prepared on FTOs ( a )  PL ( b )  and TRPL ( c ) spectra of the perovskite/m-TiO2 and perovskite/planar TiO2

measurements are used to evaluate the internal resistances including series resistance ( Rs )  charge transport resistance ( Rct )  and recombination resistance ( Rrec ) related to the photovoltaic properties  Two distinctive arcs are observed in the Nyquist plots as shown in Fig  4d  The equivalent circuit consisting of one resistance ( R ) and two parallel resistance ( R ) –capacitance ( C ) components in series as shown inside Fig  3d is used to fit the data [ 20 ]  where the two R–C components assigned to high and low frequency ranges are used to estimate the charge transport resistance ( Rct ) and the recombination resistance ( Rrec )  respectively  The optimized mesoscopic PSC shows a little higher Rs than that of the planar one ( 730 versus 591 Ω )  according to the thicker m-TiO2 ETL than the TiO2 NCs ETL  In addition  the optimized mesoscopic PSC has a decreased Rct ( 4559 Ω ) and an increased Rrec ( 12180 Ω ) compared with those of the planar one ( 5109 and 10930 Ω  respectively )  indicating enhanced charge transport speed and suppressed dark recombination  which finally contribute to improved fill factor ( FF ) and open-circuit voltage ( Voc ) of the corresponding device [ 21 ]  4 Conclusion In summary  sizable TiO2 microspheres are successfully synthesized by a novel emulsion-based bottom-up self-assembly strategy  The optimized mesoscopic PSC yields enhanced photovoltaic performance with a PCE as high as 1927 % and greatly decreased J–V hysteresis compared with the planar one  The reasons can be owing to the preferable charge carrier dynamics including the faster electron-extraction speed  lower charge carrier transport resistance  and suppressed dark recombination of the optimized mesoscopic PSC  revealed by the better parameter values of related PL  TRPL  and EIS curves  Because of the general strategy for preparing microspheres from TiO2 and other kinds of semiconductor NCs  the emulsion-based bottom-up self-assembled microspheres are good candidates for preparing efficient mesoscopic PSCsOrganic-inorganic hybrid Sn-based perovskite photodetectors with high external quantum efficiencies and wide spectral responses

photodetection owing to their high charge carrier mobility  long charge carrier diffusion length  low dark current density and sharp absorption edge  However  a relatively small band gap ( 16 eV ) limits their photonharvesting efficiency in the near-infrared region  In the present work  we demonstrate a hybrid methylamine iodide and Pb-Sn binary perovskite as the light absorption layer in photodetectors  Experimentally  the wavelength of photoresponse onset for the photodetectors can be extended to as great as 1000 nm when the Sn content of the hybrid perovskite is increased to 30 mol %  In addition  the photodetectors exhibit a photoresponsivity of 039 A W−1  a specific detectivity of 7×1012 Jones  a fast photoresponse with rise and decay time constants and an external quantum efficiency greater than 50 % in the wavelength range of 350–900 nm  with a maximum value of about 80 % at 550 nm  Keywords : organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite  photodetector  external quantum efficiency  spectral response  specific detectivity INTRODUCTION Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites have been considered to be one of the most promising materials for solar energy harvesting and other optoelectronic devices due to long excitation diffusion length  high charge carrier mobility  direct band gap and large absorption coefficient [ 1–5 ]  In fact  the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of these materials has increased over the past nine years from 38 % to the current record of 221 % [ 6–14 ]  In addition to organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites  some all-inorganic perovskites also attracted the attention of researchers [ 1516 ]  A broad community of researchers also paid attention to perovskite photodetectors [ 17 ]  Yang et al  [ 18 ] were the first to demonstrate an organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite photodetectors with an inverted device configuration in 2014  Interestingly  the inverted conjugated polymer ( poly [ ( 99-bis ( 3 ’ - ( N  N-dimethylamino ) propyl ) -27-fluorene ) -alt-27- ( 99–dioctylfluorene ) ]  PFN ) provided an additional electric field that prevented hole injection and suppressed the dark current density  The resulting specific detectivity ( D * ) approached 1014 Jones  Huang et al  [ 19 ] also reported a device interface engineering  where  after replacing the conductive polymer composed of poly ( 34-ethylenedioxythiophene ) ( PEDOT ) doped with poly ( styrenesulfonate ) ( PSS )  denoted as PEDOT : PSS  with N4  N4 ’ -bis ( 4- ( 6- ( ( 3-ethyloxetan-3-yl ) methoxy ) hexyl ) phenyl ) -N4  N4 ’ -diphenylbiphenyl-44 ’

Springer Nature 2018 June 2019  Vol  62 No  6 photodetector based on an organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite light absorption layer to achieve low noise  infrared ( IR ) -blind visibility and high D *  For all the above discussed photodetectors  the light absorption layer was composed of CH3NH3PbI3 ( or CH3NH3PbI3−xClx )  However  due to the small band gap ( 16 eV ) [ 2122 ]  these devices provided a photoresponse onset at about 800 nm  which hindered the efficient harvesting of photons in the near-IR ( NIR ) region  Therefore  the key to further enhance the performance of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite photodetectors is to broaden the photoresponse into the NIR region  Although a photoresponse up to 950 nm was reported using polymer-perovskite hybrid thin films as the light absorber in our recent work [ 23 ]  these photodetectors yielded only an EQE of ~60 % in the visible region of the spectrum  which is less than most organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite photodetectors  Recently  Fan et al  [ 24 ] reported lead-free perovskite photodetectors with drastically improved stability  but they showed a detectivity lower than 1011 Jones  The present study aims to resolve this deficiency in our previous work by a hybrid CH3NH3I and Pb-Sn binary perovskite with a layered structure composed of indium tin oxide ( ITO )  PEDOT : PSS  CH3NH3Pb1−xSnxI3  C60 and Al layers  which serves as the front contact  hole extraction  light absorption layer  electron extraction and back contact  respectively  The hybrid perovskite thin films were formed by the deposition of a mixture of tin iodide ( SnI2 ) with a molar content defined by x and lead iodide ( PbI2 ) with a molar content defined by 1−x  followed by the deposition of CH3NH3I [ 25 ]  The hybrid perovskite photodetector with a Sn content of 30 mol % ( ie  x=03 ) provided the best photon harvesting performance with a NIR photoresponse of 1000 nm  EXPERIMENTAL SECTION CH3NH3I was synthesized via the reaction of 24 mL methylamine ( 33 wt % in ethanol ; Aldrich ) and 10 mL hydroiodic acid ( 57 wt % in water ; Aladdin ) in 100 mL ethanol in an ice bath for 2 h with stirring [ 26 ]  The precipitate was collected using a rotary evaporator at 50°C to remove the solvent  and the product was recrystallized from ethanol  The crystals were filtered and washed three times with diethyl ether  and the solid was dried at 60°C in a vacuum oven overnight  All other materials were purchased from commercial sources  All photodetectors were fabricated on commercial ITO patterned glass electrode substrates  As illustrated in Fig  1  PEDOT : PSS ( Clevios™ P VP Al 4083  Heraeus ) was spin-coated on the ITO at 5000 rpm for 55 s and cured in a furnace at 120°C for 20 min in air  CH3NH3Pb1−xSnxI3 layers in our photodetector devices were prepared by the interdiffusion of PbI2 and SnI2 induced by thermal annealing [ 24 ]  Briefly  a mixture of PbI2 and SnI2 was deposited by spin coating on the PEDOT : PSS surface using a ( [ PbI2 ] 1−x+ [ SnI2 ] x ) and N  N-dimethylformamide ( DMF ) solution  The perovskite composition depended on x of 0  015  03  05 and 10  A CH3NH3I layer was spin-coated on the top of the PbI2 and SnI2 film  followed by annealing at 110°C for 45 min [ 25 ]  Then  a 50 nm C60 layer was evaporated on the CH3NH3Pb1−xSnxI3 layer surface at a rate of 005 nm s−1  Finally  a 100 nm Al layer was deposited by thermal evaporation on the C60 surface  The area of these devices is 008 cm2  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Fig  2a shows the crystal structure of the hybrid CH3NH3Pb1−xSnxI3 perovskite  where the red spheres ( A )  blue spheres ( X ) and green spheres ( B ) are CH3NH3 groups  I and Pb or Sn  respectively  Theoretically  the stability of this hybrid perovskite structure can be evaluated according to a tolerance_factor α  defined as follows [ 27 ] : α= ( rA+rX ) / ( 21/2 ( rB+rX ) ) ( 1 )  where rA  rB and rX are the atomic radii of A  B and X  respectively  For a stable hybrid perovskite structure  α should be between 0813 and 1107 [ 28 ]  We can calculate α for a hybrid PbSn binary perovskite according to standard atomic radii  Figure 1 Schematic diagram

PbI2 and SnI2 ( green ) was deposited by spin coating on the PEDOT : PSS surface using a ( [ PbI2 ] 1−x+ [ SnI2 ] x ) and DMF solution  A second layer consisting of CH3NH3I ( red ) was spin-coated on the top of the PbI2 and SnI2 film  followed by annealing  CH3NH3Pb1−xSnxI3 layer was painted black  Then  C60 and Al layer were deposited by thermal evaporation  More details were shown in

and plot the results according to x ( Fig  2b )  The α for CH3NH3PbI3 ( ie  x=0 ) is 0834 and that for CH3NH3SnI3 ( ie  x=1 ) is 0852  Therefore  the hybrid Pb-Sn binary perovskite is stable for all x  This theoretical finding is further verified experimentally by the following results  X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) patterns of CH3NH3PbI3  CH3NH3Pb085Sn015I3  CH3NH3Pb07Sn03I3  CH3NH3Pb05- Sn05I3 and CH3NH3SnI3 hybrid perovskite films deposited on PEDOT : PSS are presented in Fig  3a  The primary XRD peaks obtained for all of these hybrid perovskites are found at about 14° and 28°  which are ascribed to ( 110 ) and ( 220 ) lattice planes  respectively  and lead to a tetragonal crystal structure [ 29 ]  In the optical absorption spectra ( Fig  3b )  the electronic absorption edges of these perovskite thin films present an obvious shift to higher wavelengths ( ie  a red-shift ) with increasing x  We also note that the optical absorption of the CH3NH3PbI3 film decreases rapidly around 780 nm  while the absorption edges of all other films decrease gradually in a long-tailed fashion  After Sn was added into Pb-based perovskite  the bandgap of perovskite will be shortened  Hence  perovskite thin films demonstrated narrowing optical absorption bands with the increase of Sn ( Fig  3c )  These results indicate that Sn is helpful for broadening the hybrid perovskite photoresponse  In Fig  4  the surface morphologies of CH3NH3PbI3  CH3NH3Pb085Sn015I3  and CH3NH3Pb07Sn03I3 are very similar  while CH3NH3Pb05Sn05I3 and CH3NH3SnI3 exhibit obvious pinholes  As found in many reports  it may be due to the rapid crystallization of Sn-based perovskite making it difficult to fabricate compact and uniform perovskite films [ 30 ]  The device structure used in this study is shown in Fig  5a  Fig  5b presents typical EQE spectra under a short circuit condition for all hybrid perovskite photodetectors  In the case of x=0  the EQE exhibits a high peak value ( ~85 % ) in the visible light region and a photoresponse onset at ~800 nm due to its band gap of 16 eV  leading to a wide spectral range in the NIR region that remains unused and thus hindering the efficient photon harvesting of the photodetector  However  with increasing x from 0 to 03  the EQE decreases only slightly below 800 nm  while the spectra exhibit obvious red-shifts to wavelengths greater than 800 nm  Here  the photoresponse onset with x=015 is ~900 nm  while that with x=03 is ~1000 nm  However  with x=05  although the photoresponse onset exceeds 1000 nm  the EQE in the visible light region is strongly attenuated compared with devices with lower Sn content  Moreover  the photodetector employing the CH3NH3SnI3 hybrid perovskite thin film with all Pb replaced by Sn exhibits no photoresponse [ 31 ]  This indicates that the Sn content affects the wavelength range of the photoresponse of the hybrid perovskite photodetectors  and implies that  if the Sn content is not too high  the photoresponse can be broadened  In addition  we measured the monochromatic NIR photoresponse of the two photodetector devices with x=015 and 03 as a function of bias voltage ( Fig  5c )  Here  we note that  at 900 nm  the EQE of the photodetector with x=03 is about 50 % greater than that with x=015  If the optical wavelength is shifted to Figure 2 ( a ) Theoretical crystal structure of the hybrid perovskite  where

Accordingly  we focus on the photodetectors with x=0 and 03 in the following analyses  The photoresponsivity ( R ) is the ratio of the photocurrent density ( Jph ) obtained by a photodetector to the incident light intensity ( Llight )  and can be given as a function of EQE as follows [ 3233 ] : R=Jph/Llight=EQE·q/hν ( 2 )  where q is the electron charge ( 16×10−19 C )  h is Planck ’ s constant and ν is the frequency of the incident light  As such  R is a good indicator of the efficiency with which photodetectors respond to optical signals  In Fig  5d  we observe that the two photoresponse curves match well with the EQE spectra of the two photodetectors  with only slight differences in the visible light region  The R for the photodetector with x=0 decreases in the spectral region of 390–800 nm  while the R  with x=03  extends up to 1000 nm  In the visible light region  the maximal R for the photodetectors with x=0 and 03 are 041 A W−1 ( at 610 or 780 nm ) and 039 A W−1 ( at 680 nm )  respectively  In the NIR spectral region of 800–1000 nm  the R for the photodetector with x=03 presents another peak value of 035 A W−1 ( at 890 nm )  The R for the photodetectors with x=015 and

dark current density ( Jd ) of the photodetectors with x=0 and 03 and the results of devices with x=015 and 05 are also shown in Fig  S2  Here  we find that the two hybrid perovskite photodetectors ( x=0 and 03 ) demonstrate a good rectification ratio ( ±1 V )  The Jd for the photodetector with x=03 is slightly less than that with x=0  If  as expected  the short noise comes mainly from Jd [ 34 ]  D * =R/ ( 2qJd ) 1/2 ( 3 ) [ 35 ]  Here  we can obtain R and Jd from Figs 5d and 6a  respectively  and plot the calculated values of D * in Fig  6b  The maximal D * obtained for the photodetector with x=0 is 65×1012 Jones ( at 650 or 750 nm ) and that with x=03 is 7×1012 Jones ( at 690 nm )  In addition  we note that the photodetector with x=03 presents another peak of D * of 6×1012 Jones in the NIR region ( 890 nm )  which exhibits a similar trend as that observed for R In addition  the values of devices with x=015 and 05 are also shown in Fig  S3  Generally  the photoresponse time strongly depends on charge transport and collection  As discussed previously [ 23 ]  the photoresponse time is defined as the time required for the photocurrent output of a photodetector from 10 % to 90 % of the saturated signal  Similarly  the recovery time is defined as the time required for the photocurrent output of a photodetector from 90 % to 10 % of the saturated signal  Normalized transient photocurrents in Fig  7  for the photoresponse and recovery times of the photodetectors with x=0 and 03  clearly indicate that the photodetector with x=0 exhibits a shorter response time than that with x=03  However  we note that  in an actual application  the pixel size would be smaller and the response time would be expected to be much shorter [ 14 ]  The calculated bandwidths of the photodetectors fabricated with x=0 and 03 are also shown in Fig  S4  The slower response and greater bandwidth of the device with x=03 indicate that  although Sn can broaden the spectral response  it also indeed reduces the speed of charge transport in hybrid perovskite thin films  Moreover  we also observed the attenuation of Sn-based perovskite is faster than Pb-based perovskite  possibly due to the oxide of Sn surface in air  All above results demonstrate Sn is an ideal material to replace Pb to fabricate higher performance perovskite photodetectors  However  further research is required to improve the performance and stability of Sn-based photodetectors in the near future  CONCLUSION We have successfully fabricated high-performance solution-processed CH3NH3Pb07Sn03I3 photodetectors by partially replacing Pb with Sn  The resulting photodetectors exhibit a photoresponse onset up to 1000 nm  a maximal EQE of approximately 80 %  a maximal D * greater than 7×1012 Jones  and a dark current density as small as a few nA cm−2  which are comparable to or better than those obtained for hybrid Pb-based perovskite photodetectors  This indicates that  with further optimization  hybrid Sn-based perovskites may replace hybrid Pb-based perovskites for fabricating high-performance photodetectors with wide spectral response in the futurarge cation ethylammonium incorporated perovskite

Abstract Perovskite light-emitting diodes ( PeLEDs ) have showed significant progress in recent years ; the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of electroluminescence in green and red regions has exceeded 20 %  but the efficiency in blue lags far behind  Here  a large cation CH3CH2NH2+ is added in PEA2 ( CsPbBr3 ) 2PbBr4 perovskite to decrease the Pb–Br orbit coupling and increase the bandgap for blue emission  X-ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance results confirmed that the EA has successfully replaced Cs+ cations to form PEA2 ( Cs1-xEAxPbBr3 ) 2PbBr4  This method modulates the photoluminescence from the green region ( 508 nm ) into blue ( 466 nm )  and over 70 % photoluminescence quantum yield in blue is obtained  In addition  the emission spectra is stable under light and thermal stress  With configuration of PeLEDs with 60 % EABr  as high as 121 % EQE of sky-blue electroluminescence located at 488 nm has been demonstrated  which will pave the way for the full color

Introduction Lead halide perovskite shows very high potential in display due to its unique emission properties  significant progresses in electroluminescence ( EL ) for perovskite light-emitting diodes ( PeLEDs ) have been achieved in recent years12345678910  The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of red and green emissions have been increased to over than 20 % 111213  while the efficiency of blue emission is still lag behind because of the difficulties in synthesizing stable materials and maintaining high quantum efficiency in the films1415  Several attempts have been done to realize blue emission of the PeLEDs  The easiest way is to incorporate chlorine into bromine-based perovskites to tune the bandgap24161718  a 57 % EQE in blue from Br–Cl halide mixed perovskite has been achieved by Yip et al  recently14  However  these Br–Cl mixture perovskite could exhibit unavoidable phase separation when exposed to light or under electrical potential414192021  which further induced peak shift or multi-peaks due to the halide migration under applying voltage  The second approach is by modulating the conduction band via metal ions doping such as Zn2+  Cu2+  Mn2+  Al3+ into lead site22232425  While the impurity induced by metal elements are considered to be one of the key factors that favors in non-radiative recombination26  To date  the effective attempts to obtain blue PeLEDs are generating the quantum-well structure via reducing-dimensional ( quasi-2D and 0D ) perovskites with different large cations71017272829  For example  Sargent et al  have used shorter iso-propylammonium ( IPA ) molecular to replace long ligands phenylethylammonium ( PEA ) and tune the quasi-2D PEA2An−1PbnX3n+1 perovskite composition with a desired n  and showed 15 % EQE in sky blue30  During preparation of this manuscript  Jin et al  have reported efficient blue light-emitting diodes ( LEDs ) based on quantum-confined bromide perovskite via using phenylbutylammonium bromide as quasi-2D phases combined with an anti-solvent film deposition method  a peak EQE of up to 95 % has been achieved31  These strategies are still focus on the modification of the cations in the two dimensional perovskite frame  In this manuscript  we introduced large cation CH3CH2NH2+ ( EA ) into the Cs+ site in PEA2 ( CsPbBr3 ) 2PbBr4 perovskite  and tuned the emission from green ( 508 nm ) into blue ( 466 nm )  The obtained perovskite films showed larger than 70 % photoluminescence quantum yield ( PLQY ) in blue  and more importantly  the blue emission shows good spectra stability under light-soaking and heating  Eventually  by optimizing the content of EABr  a 121 % EQE of the sky-blue ( 488 nm ) EL was obtained  which could be the highest efficiency for blue emission PeLEDs so far  Results The thin films characterization To obtain high efficient blue PeLEDs  quasi-2D perovskite PEA2 ( CsPbBr3 ) n-1PbBr4 ( n = 3  see “ Methods ” ) with efficient green emission as the initial composition for modification  The emission wavelength of quasi-2D PEA2 ( CsPbBr3 ) 2PbBr4 was located at 508 nm as shown in Fig  1a  The three-dimensional perovskite CsPbBr3 was chosen as the main core of the emission  excess of CsBr ( CsBr : PbBr2 = 2:1  molar ratio ) has been introduced to passivate the non-radiative defects recombination9  The long alkyl chain phenylethylammonium bromide ( PEABr ) has been generally introduced in the perovskites in order to form a 2D phases when it replaces A-site atoms of the outer  which has been demonstrated to confine the charge and enhance emission10  Fig  1 : Characteristics of perovskite films with different EABr  figure 1 a Normalized steady photoluminescence ( PL ) spectra  b UV–vis absorption spectra  and c Photoluminescence

spectra of quasi-2D perovskite film with 60 % EABr after continuous thermal treatment ( 60 °C ) for different times  Full size image The quasi-2D PEA2 ( CsPbBr3 ) 2PbBr4 perovskite films with different ratio of EABr were synthesized through mixing PbBr2  CsBr  PEABr  and EABr in the solution of dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) and a one-step spin-coating process ( details in “ Methods ” )  As shown in Fig  1a  the emission of films can be tuned from 508 nm to 466 nm with increasing EA cations from 0 to 100 %  The emission images of these samples under ultraviolet excitation ( 365 nm ) are shown in Supplementary Fig  1  consistent with PL results  the band edge absorption also showed a blue-shift ( Fig  1b )  The PLQY has been increased from 42 % for the control film to around 70 % while less than 60 % is introduced  it was also found that too much EABr ( ≥80 % ) lead to the decrease of PLQY ( Fig  1d )  The increasing PLQY could be due to the suppression of non-radiative recombination by EABr doping  The reduction of PLQY with the increasing EA cation could be explained that amount of EA has not been introduced into CsPbBr3  resulting non-radiative recombination centers  The details in emission properties of these samples are plotted in Supplementary Fig  2 and summarized in Supplementary Table 1  The spectra stability is a critical issue for blue emission of perovskite materials  The photo and thermal stability of quasi-2D perovskite film with 60 % EABr sealed with 40 mg ml−1 poly ( methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) as example were studied  The PL spectra of the quasi-2D perovskite with EABr was kept under continuous ultraviolet light illumination ( 360 nm  1 mW cm−2 ) for 240 min ( Fig  1d  Supplementary Fig  3a )  The blue perovskite film also illustrates good thermal stability  both of the PL peak position and FWHM were not changed after annealing at 60 °C for 270 min ( Fig  1e  Supplementary Fig  3b )  In comparison  we found the Cl–Br mixed perovskite PEA2CsPb ( Br01Cl09 ) 3 PbBr4 with emission owns blue region exhibited poor spectral stability ( Supplementary Fig  4 )  We carried out the X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) characterization for PEA2 ( EAxCs1−xPbBr3 ) 2PbBr4 with different EABr to check the phases ( Fig  2b )  The XRD patterns of the thin film without EABr shows three main peaks at 1542°  3037°  and 3103°  which match well with the ( 100 ) and ( 200 ) planes of CsPbBr3 and ( 006 ) of Cs4PbBr6 respectively  It is found that the diffraction peaks from ( 100 ) of CsPbBr3 and ( 006 ) of Cs4PbBr6 become weaker and finally disappear with increasing EA cation  More importantly  the main diffraction at 3037° gradually decreased to 3026°  due to the large molecular size of EA cation ( EA+  274 ppm ) compared with cesium cation ( Cs+  177 ppm ) 32  we can anticipate that the EA cation has been filled into the crystal lattice of CsPbBr3 to form Cs1−xEAxPbBr3 ( 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 ) perovskite phase in quasi-2D structure ( Fig  2a )  To confirm the successful incorporation of EABr in the final quasi-2D perovskite films  we measured the 1H NMR spectra of the EABr  PEABr powder and the quasi-2D perovskite films with or without EABr  which were dissolved in DMSO-d6  The EA signals from EABr power were completely keeping in line with the quasi-2D perovskite with EABr film  as shown in Fig  2d  which manifested the EA cation can been filled into the quasi-2D perovskite  Fig  2 : Crystal composition of perovskite films  figure 2 a Schematics showing the EA cation doping in the perovskite lattice to replace Cs+ in

Cs1−xEAxPbBr3 ( 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 ) perovskite thin films  d 1H NMR spectra of the EABr  PEABr powers and quasi-2D perovskite with or without EABr  Full size image To further confirm the insertion of EA in CsPbBr3 crystal lattice  the XRD patterns of pure 3D perovskite of CsPbBr3 with different EABr were collected ( Fig  2c )  Similarly  the introduction of EABr lead to the decrease of the diffraction angles  indicating an expansion of the CsPbBr3 crystal lattice by insertion of the larger EA cations  The emission wavelength and optical bandgap of these perovskite films can be tuned from green to blue region by adding EABr into CsPbBr3 ( Supplementary Fig  5 )  It might be argued that a possibility the EA leads to formation of the quasi-2D perovskites by acting as a capping ligand  In that case  we should observe emission or absorption features from two dimensional perovskites in mixed perovskites  However  while the samples with moderate amount of EABr ( x < 075 ) show only one dominant emission peak and no excitonic absorption peaks at higher energy  providing evidence that these films are only simple phases  Whiling introducing more EABr ( x ≥ 075 ) in CsPbBr3  the films exhibit two photoluminescence peaks and an excitonic absorption  the higher energy emission and sharp absorption peaks is almost overlap with EAPbBr3 itself  indicating that EA maybe not completely go into the CsPbBr3 while the EA amount is too much  These results are consistent with the results shown in Fig  1c and could also explain why the PLQY of the PEA2 ( CsPbBr3 ) 2PbBr4 is low while incorporating too much EABr  As we know  the size of guanidinium ( GA ) molecular is similar as the cation of EA molecular32  The GA molecular have been tried to tune the emission of quasi-two dimensional perovskites  unfortunately  it is found that the GA molecular can not tune the emission from green region into blue ( Supplementary Fig  6 )  We carried out morphologies characterization of the perovskite films with different EABr by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) ( Supplementary Figs  7 and 8 )  The root mean square roughness of these films are around 05 nm  the smooth film will avoid leakage current  In addition  the crystal size has not been decreased while introducing of the EA into the PEA2 ( CsPbBr3 ) 2PbBr4 perovskite  indicating that the blue shift of the emission could not be originated from quantum confinement effect  Density functional theory ( DFT ) calculation To gain further insights regarding the origin of the band gap increasing in the quasi-2D perovskite  we carried on theoretical band structure calculations within DFT using CsPbBr3  Cs075EA025PbBr3 and Cs05EA05PbBr3 as the model system  The details are provided in the “ Methods ” section  A 4 × 3 × 4 k-mesh for orthorhombic unit cell CsPbBr3 is performed in relaxation ( Fig  3a )  All atomic coordinates and the lattice parameters are relaxed until forces of each atom were less than 002 eV  The hybrid functional exchange-correlation functional of Heyd–Scuseria-Ernzerhof ( HSE06 ) 33 with 25 % Hartree-Fock is considered at accurate calculation of electronic structures  The band structure of CsPbBr3 is shown in Fig  2b  The calculated electronic density of states ( DOS ) of CsPbBr3  Cs075EA025PbBr3  and Cs05EA05PbBr3 is shown in Fig  3c  the calculated corresponding bandgaps are 230  258  and 260 eV  which are in good agreement with the experimental observations in the absorption spectra ( 234  237  and 241 eV  Supplementary Fig  5b )

density of states ( DOS ) of CsPbBr3  Cs075EA025PbBr3  and Cs05 EA05PbBr3  d Schematic representation of variation of energy levels of quasi-2D perovskite in Pb 6p and ( Pb 6s + Br 4p ) orbitals on insertion of EA cation  The valence band maximum ( VBM ) and conduction band minimum ( CBM ) come from ( Pb 6s + Br 4p ) and Pb 6p orbitals  respectively  Full size image The first-principle calculation of three-dimensional perovskite has confirmed the increasing of band gap with introduction of EA cation into CsPbBr3 lattice  It might be argued that the increase of lattice will generally lead to decrease the bandgap  such as MAPbBr3 and FAPbBr3 compared with CsPbBr3  and why the large size of EA insertion lead to the enlargement of bandgap of CsPbBr3 ? It could be simply explained that the uneven lattice expansion makes the length of the six Pb–Br bonds increase differently  and resulting different decreases for valence band maximum ( VBM ) and conduction band minimum ( CBM ) in energy  As we know  the bandgap of the APbBr3 is determined by Pb–Br orbitals coupling34  the longest bonding Pb–Br length with the smallest coupling will determine the CBM  while the shortest Pb–Br bond with the strongest coupling will control the VBM  The insertion of EA cation could mainly affect the shortest Pb–Br bond which lower the VBM of obviously  and increase the bandgap  More fundamental study of the Cs1−xEAxPbBr3 system will be carried out to explore the clear reason of the band gap enlargement via EA introduction in the near future  The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy ( UPS ) results showed that the enlargement of bandgap after introducing EA is mainly due to the downshift of the VBM ( Fig  3d  Supplementary Figs  9a  b )  further confirming the insertion of EA into the CsPbBr3 lattice  Discussion Encouraged by above findings  we constructed LEDs using with PEA2 ( Cs1−xEAxPbBr3 ) 2PbBr4 as active layer  A device structure glass/ITO/m-PEDOT : PSS ( 35 nm ) /Perovskite ( 25 nm ) /TBPi ( 40 nm ) /LiF ( 1 nm ) /Al ( 70 nm ) is adopted  in which m-PEDOT : PSS is PSS-Na modified PEDOT : PSS to increase the work function forming better level alignment for hole injection and electron blocking1035  The schematic of the band alignment diagram and the cross-section SEM image of the completed device are shown in Supplementary Fig  10  The performance of the PeLEDs are characterized and summarized in Fig  4a–c and Table 1  It can be found that the maximum brightness are 2790  2191  and 83 cd m−2 ( Fig  4a )  the EQE are 133 %  121 % and 419 % ( Fig  4b ) and the EL are located at 495  488 and 480 nm ( Fig  4c ) for 40 %  60 % and 80 % EABr  respectively  The normalized EL spectra of PeLEDs with different ratios of EABr was obtained at 6 V and all the emissions held up narrow full-widths at half-maximum ( FWHMs ) of ≤25 nm  resulting in the high color purity in Commission Internationale de l ’ Eclairage ( CIE ) coordinate as shown in Fig  4e  It is obvious that the EL image of varying EABr was in line with the result of EL spectra and CIE ( Fig  4f )  With the blue shift of EL spectra  the corresponding CIE value and the EL image of different EABr also changed from the green to blue region  indicating the successful achievement of a blue-emissive perovskite LED  To our best knowledge  the 121 % EQE for sky-blue emission at 488 nm could be the best for the PeLEDs  The lower efficiency while shifting the emission into deeper blue region could be due to the low PLQY and also large poor injection ( Figs  1c and 4a )  A histogram of peak EQEs for 28 devices shows an average value of ~95 % in Supplementary Fig  11  the statistical data mean that the performance of PeLEDs device owns good reproducibility  Fig  4 : Performance of the PeLEDs with different ratio of EABr  figure 4 a Characterization of current density and luminance versus applied voltage  b Characterization of

quasi-2D perovskite LEDs with different ratios of EABr  Full size table The spectra stability of EL under applied voltage was tested  it is clear that the normalized EL spectra of PeLEDs with 60 % EABr is unchanged with the increasing applied voltage ( Fig  4d )  suggesting that the emission spectra is stable under applied voltage  We have collected about 12 min video of our LEDs working at a constant current density of 03 mA cm−2  it can be found that EL show the constant color at varying the time ( Supplementary Movie 1 )  In comparison  as similar as photoluminescence  the EL spectra changed for mixed halide perovskite with increasing the voltage ( Supplementary Fig  12 )  We have carried out the device stability test at a constant current density of 15 mA cm−2 and also at the 100 cd m−2  we found that the device without encapsulation could survive around 1 h in nitrogen glove box ( Supplementary Fig  13 )  The increasing input voltage at constant current brings increasing input power  suggesting that increasing Joule heating takes place in the device  which could contribute for instability of PeLEDs  In conclusion  we have demonstrated that the blue emission of perovskite LEDs with EA cation incorporation into three-dimensional perovskite lattice  The emission has been tuned from green into blue  and showed high PLQY ( > 70 % )  In addition  the emission spectra is stable under photo and thermal stress  With tailoring the EA composition  an efficient PeLEDs with 121 % EQE in 488 nm emission has been achieved  This concept is expected to open an avenue for full color display using PeLEDs  Methods Materials CsBr  PbBr2  DMSO and poly ( sodium 4-styrenesulfonate ) ( PSS-Na  average Mw ~ 70000 ) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich  22 ’ 2 ” - (

Greatcell Solar )  The modified PEDOT : PSS ( m-PEDOT : PSS ) solution is mix of normal PEDOT : PSS ( AI 4083 ) aqueous solution and 100 mg ml−1 PSS-Na aqueous solution by a volume ration of 3:1  Perovskite solution preparation The CsxEA1−xPbBr3 and PEA2PbBr4 precursor solution were precursor solution were prepared by dissolving appropriately stoichiometric CsBr  EABr  PEABr  and PbBr2 in DMSO under continuous stirring for 4 h at room temperature  keeping the molar concentration PbBr2 at 01 M The CsPbBr3 precursor solution was also prepared by dissolving CsBr and PbBr2 ( 2:1 in molar ) in DMSO under continuous stirring for 4 h at room temperature  keeping Pb2+ at 01 M  too  The quasi-2D perovskite PEA2 ( CsPbBr3 ) 2PbBr4 precursor solution was mixed the PEA2PbBr4 and CsPbBr3 by a volume ration of 1:2  The ratio of m % EABr refers to the molar between EABr and PbBr2  Device fabrication The indium tin oxide ( ITO ) -coated glass substrates were sequentially cleaned by sonication in detergent  deionized water  acetone and isopropyl alcohol and then dried by N2  After a ultraviolet ozone treatment for ITO in 10 min  the modified PEDOT : PSS aqueous solution was spin-coated onto the ITO substrate at 9000 rpm for 60 s and baked at 160 °C for 15 min in ambient air  Thereafter  the substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box  and the perovskite precursor solution was then spin-coated on the m-PEDOT : PSS film at 3000 rpm for 2 min  followed by annealing on a hot plate at 60 °C for 20 min  Finally  the fabrication of PeLEDs was completed by depositing TBPi ( 40 nm ) and LiF/Al electrodes ( 1 nm/100 nm ) layer by layer through a shadow mask in high vacuum thermal evaporator  The device area was 10 mm2 as defined by overlapping area of ITO and Al electrode  First-principle calculations The electronic structures of CsPbBr3  Cs075EA025PbBr3  and Cs05EA05PbBr3 are calculated using DFT methods ( employing the ab initio code VASP ) 36 with the projector-augmented wave ( PAW ) pseudopotentials37  A plane wave cutoff energy of 400 eV and the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof revised for solids ( PBEsol ) exchange-correlation functional are employed38  Perovskite film and device characterizations The SEM images were obtained using a field-emission SEM ( FEI NanoSEM650 )  which used an electron beam accelerated at 500 V to 30 kV  enabling operation at a variety of currents  AFM measurements were carried out using a Bruker FASTSCANBIO in non-contact mode  The XRD patterns of the perovskite thin films were performed with a Rigaku D/max 2500H equipment with a conventional Cu target X-ray tube ( Cu K-alpha  λ = 15405 Å ) as the X-ray source  Scans were taken with a 05-mm-wide source and detector slits  with X-ray generator settings at 40 kV and 30 mA  Proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1H NMR ) spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance II 400 MHz system with BBI probe  Steady-state PL spectra of the perovskite films was measured at room temperature in the ambient air using a FLS1000 spectrometer  Absorption spectra were acquired using an ultraviolet-visible spectrometer ( Cary 5000 )  PLQYs of the perovskite thin films were recorded by a commercialized PLQY measurement system ( LQE-50-PL ) from Enlitech with excitation from a 368 nm LED  UPS spectra was performed on a Thermo Scientific ESCALab250Xi with an applied bias of −10 V The He I emission line at 2122 eV was employed  The Helium pressure in the analysis chamber during measurement was about 3 × 10−8 mbar  The film samples over the ITO layer had a conductive connection with an Au sample  so the Fermi level value of the film samples is equal to that of Au samples  The work function Ф ( that is the Fermi level absolute value of the free film ) of the test films can be calculated from following equation : hν – Ф = EFermi – Ecutoff  where EFermi and Ecutoff is the value of Fermi level position and the steep edge position in UPS spectrum  respectively  hν = 2122 eV and EFermi = 2151 eV  The I-V-L curve  EL spectrum  EQE  CIE  and operating lifetime of the perovskite LED were carried out simultaneously by a commercialized system ( LQE-50-EL  Enlitech ) that was equipped with an integrated sphere and photomultiplier tubes ( PTM )  in which the PMT is used to measure the low luminance  All the device characterization tests of perovskite LEDs were recorded at room temperature in the ambient air for the un-encapsulated devices  except that the operational stability test was carried out in an N2-filled glovebox  To confirm our measurement results  cross-checking with other research groups was carried out  We tried our best to encapsulate the devices and measured at the different research units  and found that the measurement results are almost consistent  Some of the devices showed about 10 % difference  which could be due to the degradation during the transmission  Data availability The data that support the findings of this study are

interface engineering  crystallization engineering  fabrication engineering  etc  [ 345 ]  In the case of silicon solar cells  the record PCE is up to 267 %  and it is very close to the theoretical Shockley–Queisser limit [ 2  6 ]  In order to overcome the efficiency limitation of single-junction devices and reduce the cost  perovskite–silicon tandem route can be potentially used to construct more efficient solar cells via stacking complementary wide-band gap perovskite absorber and narrow-band gap silicon absorber [ 7 ]  Traditional crystalline silicon solar cells can absorb visible light and near-infrared light over the solar spectrum and convert them into electrical energy  but photons in the visible region have thermal relaxation phenomena that cause a portion of the energy to be lost in the form of thermal energy  Using tandem solar cell technology  a polycrystalline perovskite film device that can efficiently convert visible light is directly prepared on the surface of a crystalline silicon solar cell  while a silicon solar cell is only responsible for converting infrared light transmitted through the perovskite film  which would greatly enhance the PCEs over 30 %  Recently  two papers published in Science reported efficient and stable perovskite–silicon two-terminal tandem solar cells [ 8  9 ]  Xu et al  [ 8 ] studied perovskite–silicon two-terminal tandem solar cells and demonstrated that the PCE of ~ 21 % silicon solar cells could be enhanced to 27 %  about 30 % enhancement  in 1-cm2 tandem solar cells ( Fig  1a–c )  The top perovskite solar cell with a wide-band gap of 167 eV was tailored using triple-halide alloys ( chlorine  bromine  iodine )  It is meaningful that they directly incorporated Cl into the lattice at much larger amounts than previously reported and observed a uniform halide distribution throughout the material with a reduction in lattice parameter and an increase in band gap corresponding to increasing the amounts of Cl in the lattice  leading to the increases in photocarrier lifetime and mobility and the suppression of light-induced phase segregation even at 100-sun illumination intensity  More importantly  the semitransparent top perovskite solar cell was very stable and only exhibited less than 4 % degradation after 1000-h maximum power point ( MPP ) operation at 60 °C  As shown in Fig  1c  in a J–V sweep  a typical tandem solar cell reached a PCE of 2713 % ( Voc = 1886 V  Jsc = 1912 mA·cm−2  and FF = 753 % ) and the stabilized PCE at MPP is 2704 %  Fig  1 figure 1 Copyright © 2020 American Association

Meanwhile  Hou et al  [ 9 ] reported perovskite–silicon two-terminal tandem solar cells that combined solution-processed micrometer-thick  wide-band gap perovskite top cell ( 168 eV gap ) with fully textured silicon heterojunction bottom solar cell ( Fig  1e )  A threefold enhanced depletion width in the perovskite semiconductor at the valleys of silicon pyramids was achieved  resulting in the improvement in the carrier collection  A concentrated precursor was used to produce high-quality micrometer-thick perovskite with large grain sizes and fully covering the micrometer-sized pyramids  The bulk properties of the perovskite film could be stabilized via a self-limiting passivation ( SLP ) treatment using 1-butanethiol vapor  leading to the enhanced diffusion length and the suppressed phase segregation  Thus  an independently certified PCE of 257 % ( Voc = 1781 V  Jsc = 1907 mA·cm−2  and FF = 754 % ) was achieved for 083-cm2 tandem solar cell ( Fig  1f  g )  Furthermore  these encapsulated perovskite–silicon tandem solar cells were very stable and exhibited negligible performance loss after a 400-h thermal stability test at 85 °C in the dark at ~ 40 % relative humidity and also after 400 h under MPP tracking at 40 °C and ~ 40 % –50 % relative humidity ( Fig  1h  i )  These two works separately demonstrated highly efficient and stable perovskite–silicon two-terminal tandem solar cell technologies  The single-junction silicon solar modules currently account for over 90 % of the global photovoltaic market with the PCEs of 19 % –21 %  Thus  these perovskite–silicon two-terminal tandem solar cell technologies have greatly potential applications because of their higher efficiency and low cost  The wide-band gap perovskite semitransparent top solar cells offer a promising path to produce perovskite–silicon tandem solar cells with the PCEs over 30 %  Although the top perovskite semitransparent top solar cells or perovskite–silicon tandem solar cells exhibited good stability over 1000 h or 400 h in these two studies  it is still much less than commercial silicon solar cells with the stability time over 25 years  It is necessary to do more work to further enhance the stability of top perovskite semitransparent top solar cells and perovskite–silicon tandem solar cells  On the other hand  large-area efficient perovskite–silicon tandem solar cells ( much bigger than 1 cm2 ) and modules are necessary to be further developed for accelerating their potential commercialization from the labsPerovskite light-emitting diodes with external quantum efficiency

in optoelectronic devices123  For example  light-emitting diodes ( LEDs ) based on these materials could see application in flat-panel displays and solid-state lighting  owing to their potential to be made at low cost via facile solution processing  and could provide tunable colours and narrow emission line widths at high photoluminescence quantum yields45678  However  the highest reported external quantum efficiencies of green- and red-light-emitting perovskite LEDs are around 14 per cent79 and 12 per cent8  respectively—still well behind the performance of organic LEDs101112 and inorganic quantum dot LEDs13  Here we describe visible-light-emitting perovskite LEDs that surpass the quantum efficiency milestone of 20 per cent  This achievement stems from a new strategy for managing the compositional distribution in the device—an approach that simultaneously provides high luminescence and balanced charge injection  Specifically  we mixed a presynthesized CsPbBr3 perovskite with a MABr additive ( where MA is CH3NH3 )  the differing solubilities of which yield sequential crystallization into a CsPbBr3/MABr quasi-core/shell structure  The MABr shell passivates the nonradiative defects that would otherwise be present in CsPbBr3 crystals  boosting the photoluminescence quantum efficiency  while the MABr capping layer enables balanced charge injection  The resulting 203 per cent external quantum efficiency represents a substantial step towards the practical application of perovskite LEDs in lighting and display  Similar content being viewed by others Dye-Sensitized Solar

Strategies for Full-Color Perovskite Light-Emitting Diodes Article Open access 07 December 2023 Main MAPbI3−xClx and MAPbBr3 were used in early perovskite LEDs that achieved external quantum efficiencies ( EQEs ) of 076 % and 01 % for the near-infrared and green regimes  respectively14  Two strategies56715 have since led to notable improvements in LED performance  The first strategy involves direct spin-coating of colloidal perovskite nanocrystals16171819 ; these nanocrystals are highly luminescent with a photoluminescence quantum yield ( PLQY ) of nearly 90 %  and their optical properties can be tuned by compositional engineering and crystal size  The second approach requires deposition of bulk perovskite films using perovskite precursor solutions whose composition can be suitably engineered ( for example  stoichiometrically modified MAPbBr36 and MAPbX3 with the addition of long-chain ammonium halides5 or 1-naphthylmethylamine halides8 )  Here we have built on prior works and pursued a new strategy for generating still higher EQEs  Our approach was to combine a high PLQY with balanced charge injection by constructing a compositionally graded perovskite based on a quasi-core/shell structure : the bottom part consists of perovskite light-emitting polycrystals capped with a defect-passivation layer that passivates the grain boundaries ; and the top part serves to passivate the surface and simultaneously balance charge injection into the perovskite LED device  We used the very different solubility and crystallinity of perovskite ( CsPbBr3 ) and passivant ( MABr ) in polar solvent and—through a one-step deposition method—fabricated in situ the compositionally graded material  This consisted of a defect-passivated perovskite layer on the bottom ( CsPbBr3/MABr ) and an electrical passivating layer ( MABr ) on top  The resulting highly luminescent perovskite films and balanced charge injection enabled the development of perovskite LED devices with an initial EQE of 17 %  We further improved the device charge injection balance by inserting an insulating layer of poly ( methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) between the perovskite layer and the electron-transfer layer ( ETL )  thereby maximizing the device efficiency at 203 %  We synthesized a CsPbBr3 perovskite powder as a starting material  and then added MABr  We engineered the amount of MABr additive to improve perovskite film formation and PLQY ( for example  ‘ mixture 10 ’ signifies that the molar ratio of MABr to CsPbBr3 is 1 )  Figure 1a shows three different perovskite structures fabricated using a strategy that we term compositional distribution management : single-layered CsPbBr3 ( prepared by one-step spin-coating ) ; bilayered CsPbBr3/MABr ( prepared by coating another layer of MABr on the as-formed CsPbBr3 layer ) ; and quasi-core/shell CsPbBr3/MABr ( mixture 10 )  Figure 1b and Extended Data Fig  1 show that the capping layer of MABr ( in the bilayered structure ) only slightly enhances photoluminescence emission  while the mixture-10 film with quasi-core/shell structure presents very bright photoluminescence emission ( see Supplementary Information  video S1 )  We found an enhancement of photoluminescence proportional to the amount of MABr additive when the molar ratio of MABr to CsPbBr3 was increased from 04 to 10 ; photoluminescence began to decrease when the molar ratio was increased beyond 10 ( Extended Data Fig  1 )  Fig  1 : Enhancing photoluminescence through compositional distribution management  figure 1 a  Schematic illustrations of single-layered

indicate the MABr shell ( the grain boundary )  The sample was prepared using a focused ion beam  and the top C layer was predeposited in order to protect the perovskite  Full size image We observed that  during film formation  CsPbBr3 crystallized rapidly  whereas MABr sequentially increased its crystallization rate after the CsPbBr3 precursor was completely consumed ( Extended Data Fig  1d )  We explain this by noting that the solubility of CsPbBr3 ( which we find to be 056 M ) is far below than that of MABr ( 5 M ) in dimethylsulfoxidde ( DMSO )  Secondary ion mass spectrometry ( SIMS ) depth analysis ( Fig  1c ) supports the CsPbBr3/MABr gradient structure  From the SIMS results  one can see that the top layer contains CH4N+ ions ( from the capping MABr ; stage Ι ) ; the middle layer comprises Pb+ ions with few CH4N+ ions ( from CsPbBr3 and MABr ; stage ΙΙ ) ; and the bottom layer consists of In+ ions ( from the indium tin oxide ( ITO ) used as the support ; stage ΙΙΙ )  To gain insight into the compositional distribution of the as-formed mixture-10 films  we carried out cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) studies  We prepared the cross-sectional TEM samples by using a focused ion beam  with C and Pt layers predeposited in order to protect the perovskite from possible ion-beam-induced damage  The cross-sectional SEM image ( Extended Data Fig  2a ) shows a high-quality perovskite film with obvious grain boundaries  The cross-sectional TEM and element-mapping images ( Fig  1d and Extended Data Fig  2b ) show a well defined layer-by-layer structure  with ITO at the bottom  topped with poly ( 34-ethylenedioxythiophene ) polystyrene sulfonate ( PEDOT : PSS )  then with CsPbBr3  MABr and finally C A shell of MABr can be seen in the grain boundaries of CsPbBr3 ( white arrows in Fig  1d )  and another layer of MABr caps the CsPbBr3  forming the quasi-core/shell structure  We sought to estimate experimentally the trap state density of the three classes of perovskite samples  We found ( Extended Data Fig  3a ) that the MABr shell reduces defects in the mixture-10 perovskite films by a factor of four compared with the single-layered CsPbBr3 film  To gain insight into the effect of the thick upper layer of MABr on photoluminescence enhancement  we washed the bright perovskite film using anhydrous isopropyl alcohol ( IPA ) solvent  and observed that the photoluminescence decreased gradually as the MABr was removed ( Extended Data Fig  3b )  To make a direct comparison  we also prepared pure CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 perovskite films  As shown in Extended Data Fig  3c  all perovskite films show a transparent yellow colour under room illumination  However  only the mixture-10 perovskite films reveal high brightness under ultraviolet-lamp excitation  The ultraviolet/visible absorbance spectra ( Extended Data Fig  3d ) of the mixture-10 film present a band-edge absorbance at 531 nm  similar to CsPbBr3 ( 528 nm )  corresponding to a bandgap of 233 eV  Analysis of the photoluminescence spectra of the three perovskite samples indicates that emission from the mixture-10 film is close to the emission of pure-CsPbBr3 films ( Extended Data Fig  3e )  In order to quantify the photoluminescence enhancement induced by the MABr additive  we measured the absolute PLQY according to a reported protocol20  We determined that the PLQY of the mixture-10 perovskite film was about 80 %  while the PLQYs of CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 are not detectable ( from an analysis of our system signal-to-noise ratio  we conclude that their PLQYs lie below 1 % )  Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra ( Extended Data Fig  3f ) show that the mixture-10 film has a 50 % longer radiative lifetime than that of pure CsPbBr3  and that the longer lifetime of the photoluminescence transition is direct evidence of a decrease in the concentration of defects and an increase in film crystallinity179  We attribute the long lifetime of photoluminescence to the fact that the compositionally graded structure combined with the MABr shell passivates the nonradiative defects in CsPbBr3  We analysed the crystal structure of the perovskite films using X-ray diffraction ( XRD ; Extended Data Fig  4a )  We conclude that the mixture-10 perovskite exhibits the same crystal structure as monoclinic CsPbBr3  instead of a mixture of separate phases of CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) data ( Extended Data Fig  4b  c ) also indicate the existence of CsPbBr3 and MABr in the mixture-10 perovskite film  The perovskite layer requires high surface coverage and low roughness in order to achieve high-performance LEDs  We characterized the surface morphology of the pure CsPbBr3  MAPbBr3 and mixture-10 perovskite films using SEM and atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) ( Extended Data Fig  5 )  We observed small particles and pinholes in the CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 films ; by contrast  in the mixture-10 film  smooth and well packed micrometre-sized cuboids were combined with good crystallinity  We fabricated perovskite LEDs consisting of single-layered CsPbBr3  single-layered MAPbBr3  bilayered CsPbBr3 and MABr  or mixture-10 perovskites with a quasi-core/shell structure  based on a device structure consisting of layered ITO/PEDOT : PSS/perovskite/B3PYMPM/LiF/Al ( Fig  2a  where B3PYMPM is C37H26N6 )  PEDOT : PSS served as the hole-transfer layer ( HTL )  B3PYMPM as the ETL  LiF as an electron-injection layer and Al as the cathode ( Extended Data Fig  6a )  Photographs of mixture-10 perovskite LED devices with six uniform and bright green-emitting pixels ( 2 mm × 15 mm ) are shown in Fig  2b  Larger-area devices ( 6 mm × 20 mm ; Extended Data Fig  6b ) showcase uniform and bright emission  Fig  2 : Fabrication of perovskite LEDs and performance evaluation  figure 2 a  Configuration of a perovskite LED cell  with

Current efficiency statistics for the mixture-10 perovskite LED  f  EQE–voltage characteristics of the best-performing mixture-10 perovskite LED  Full size image The device performance of bilayered CsPbBr3/MABr perovskite is quite limited ( Extended Data Fig  6c ) —only slightly better than that of the single-layered CsPbBr3—possibly because of its low PLQY and poor surface morphology  The mixture-10 devices display an emission peak at 525 nm with a full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) of 20 nm ( Extended Data Fig  6d  e )  corresponding to a CIE colour-space coordinates of ( 018  075 )  We collected current-density–voltage ( J–V ) and luminance–voltage ( L–V ) curves in order to evaluate the LED performance ( Extended Data Fig  6f–h )  Devices fabricated using mixture 10 exhibited the lowest current density at the same time as the highest luminance  indicating the best performance among our three classes of perovskite LED  The mixture-10 devices gave a maximum current efficiency of 23 cd A−1 at 38 V—fully three orders of magnitude higher than the current efficiency of the pure CsPbBr3- and MAPbBr3-based LEDs ( Fig  2c )  We posited that the superior LED performance of the mixture-10 devices arises not only from the high PLQY  but also from its combination with improved charge injection balance  To quantify charge injection  we measured the J–V scharacteristics of electron-only devices ( ITO/B3PYMPM/perovskite/B3PYMPM/Al ) or hole-only devices ( ITO/PEDOT : PSS/perovskite/Au ) ( Fig  2d )  We conclude that electrons dominate injection into the pure-CsPbBr3 devices  whereas a more balanced charge injection occurs in the case of mixture-10 devices  After optimization  we obtained an average current efficiency of 35 cd A−1 from 20 devices  with the best current efficiency reaching 65 cd A−1 ( Fig  2e )  The EQE–V characteristics of the best-performing device show a maximum EQE of 17 % at 42 V ( Fig  2f ) —a record for a green-emitting perovskite LED  Figure 2d shows that the capping MABr layer in the quasi-core/shell structure helps to reduce electron injection and improve charge balance  We thought that further improvement could potentially be realized through additional optimization of charge balance  We achieved this by depositing a thin PMMA layer on the as-formed perovskite  We then tested electron-only and hole-only device performance again  and found that the PMMA layer further helps in balancing charge injection ( Fig  3a )  We therefore inserted a thin PMMA layer between the perovskite and ETL ( Fig  3b and Extended Data Fig  7a )  We found the PMMA to be continuous and smooth ( Extended Data Fig  7b  c )  enabling charge injection into perovskite via tunnelling13  After we optimized the thickness of the PMMA layer and the molar ratio between MABr and CsPbBr3 in the mixed perovskite precursor ( Extended Data Fig  7d  e )  the devices reached a higher current efficiency of 78 cd A−1 ( Fig  3c )  Fig  3 : Enhancing the performance of perovskite LEDs by inserting a thin PMMA layer between the perovskite and the ETL  figure 3 a  Current density–voltage ( J–V ) curves of electron-only and hole-only devices with a PMMA

constant driving current of 5 mA ( 167 mA cm−2 ) led to the luminance increasing from 3800 cd m−2 to 7130 cd m−2 ( L0 ) and then diminishing  We estimate this device ’ s T50 at 100 cd m−2 to be about 10456 h Full size image Figure 3d presents the J–V and L–V curves of the best-performing mixture-10 device  showing a low driving current density and high luminance of 14000 cd m−2  A low turn-on voltage of 27 V—just slightly higher than the bandgap of the mixture-10 perovskite—is obtained because of the high quality of the perovskite thin film and the more efficient carrier injection from the HTL and ETL  We also found that the electroluminescence spectra at different applied voltages remained the same  and that the maximum power efficiency was 69 lm W−1 at 36 V ( Extended Data Fig  8 )  A maximum EQE value of 203 % is achieved with a luminance of 3400 cd m−2 ( Fig  3e and Supplementary Information  videos S2 and S3 )  We measured the lifetime of the device by applying a constant current and monitoring the evolution of luminance1321  After we applied a constant driving current of 5 mA ( 167 mA cm−2 )  the luminance increased from 3800 cd m−2 to 7130 cd m−2 ( L0 ) in 066 min and then began to diminish ( Fig  3f )  The half-lifetime ( T50 ) —defined as the time taken for the luminance to decrease to L0/2—was about 10 min  By using a calculation of  and assuming an acceleration factor of n = 15 ( ref  13 ; Extended Data Fig  9a )  we estimate this device ’ s T50 at 100 cd m−2 to be about 100 h—to our knowledge  the highest value estimated to date in high-performance perovskite LEDs  and an important step towards practical application  We also measured the stability of the device under continuous operation with luminance maintained at a constant value of about 100 cd m−2  achieved by tuning the applied current to maintain luminance  The results ( see Supplementary Information  video S4  and Extended Data Fig  9b ) show that the device could operate continuously for about 46 h  a similar order of magnitude to the extrapolated value from the accelerated ageing test  The corresponding EQE decreased from 13 % to 56 % over these 46 hours of continuous operation  indicating that the device did degrade even at this low luminance  Nonetheless  the stability performance shown here is two to three orders of magnitude higher than previous reported values7922232425 ( Extended Data Table 1 )  In summary  we have demonstrated a new strategy for realizing compositionally graded perovskite devices that simultaneously achieve high PLQY and balanced charge injection  Our approach exploits the differing solubilities of perovskite precursors to control the crystallization of CsPbBr3/MABr gradient structure in a single step  The MABr shell passivates nonradiative defect sites in CsPbBr3 crystals  and the MABr capping layer balances charge injection  These effects together allow us to achieve perovskite LEDs with a narrow green emission  exhibiting a record EQE that surpasses 20 %  This high EQE is now on a par with those of more mature technologies such as organic LEDs  Improvements in device stability remain a challenge  and strides in that direction might be achieved by suppressing ion migration with additives or a blocking layer  fabricating a high-quality perovskite layer  and further optimizing the perovskite/ETL and perovskite/HTL interfaces262728  Methods Unless otherwise stated  all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received  Preparation of perovskite precursor We first synthesized CsPbBr3 powder and used it as a starting material for precursor preparation  Specifically  we dissolved PbBr2 ( 10 mmol  367 g ) in hydrobromic acid ( 8 ml )  then added CsBr ( 10 mmol  212 g  dissolved in 3 ml of water ) drop by drop  producing an orange precipitate  The precipitate was filtered  washed twice using ethanol  and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h before use  CH3NH3Br ( abbreviated to MABr ) was prepared by reacting 12 ml of methylamine ( 33 wt % in absolute ethanol ) and 11 ml of hydrobromic acid ( 48 wt % in H2O ) in an ice bath for 2 h with continuous stirring  The solvent was removed using rotary evaporation at 50 °C to obtain a white MABr powder  For purification  the as-prepared MABr powder was re-dissolved in ethanol and precipitated with diethyl ether  Finally  the white powder was collected by filtration and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for at least 12 h before use  The MAPbBr3 precursor was prepared by dissolving PbBr2 and MABr ( 1:1 molar ratio ) in DMSO solvent to make a 05 M solution  CsPbBr3 powder can be fully dissolved in DMSO solvent to make a 05 M starting solution  Then  different amounts of MABr were added to the as-prepared CsPbBr3 solution to make a mixture perovskite precursor  with the mixture being named through the molar ratio of MABr to CsPbBr3  For example  to prepare a precursor of mixture 10  5598 mg of MABr ( 05 mmol ) was added to 1 ml of the as-prepared CsPbBr3 ( 05 mmol ) solution  Fabrication of perovskite LEDs Prepatterned ITO glasses ( 20 mm × 20 mm ) were ultrasonically washed in  sequentially  detergent solution  deionized water  acetone and ethanol  and then dried with compressed N2  The substrates were further cleaned with UV-Ozone cleaner ( Novascan  PSD ) for 30 min before spin-coating  A 40-nm-thick HTL was prepared by spin-coating using PEDOT : PSS ( Clevios PV P AI4083 ) at 4000 rpm  for 60 s and baking at 150 °C for another 15 min  After cooling to room temperature  the substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box ( H2O less than 1 part per million ( ppm  ) ; O2 less than 1 ppm ) for deposition of the perovskite layer  The perovskite layer was prepared through the same spin-coating procedures but used a different precursor solution  Specifically  30 µl of perovskite precursor was dropped onto the substrate and spun at 2000 rpm  for 60 s  during which time ( at 30 s ) 500 µl of toluene was dropped quickly onto the surface  Another thin layer of PMMA blocking layer was prepared if needed : 50 µl of PMMA solution ( 05 mg ml−1 in acetone ) was spin-coated onto the as-prepared perovskite layer at 4000 rpm  for 60 s There was no annealing process and the as-prepared substrates were transferred into a thermal evaporator  The chamber was vacuum-pumped down to 50 × 10−4 Pa  and a 40-nm-thick layer of B3PYMPM ( Lumtec  Taiwan )  2-nm-thick layer of LiF and 100-nm-thick layer of Al were sequentially evaporated  We defined the area of the perovskite LED device as the area of overlap between the ITO and the Al electrode ; it is 3 mm2 ( 2 mm × 15 mm )  We also used a charge-coupled-device ( CCD ) camera to measure the actual device area  Material characterization We characterized surface morphologies by field-emission SEM ( using a Hitachi S-8000 scanning electron microscope )  To determine the distribution of ions in the perovskite film  we used TOF-SIMS ( ION-TOF GmbH  ToF SIMS V )  We characterized bright-field  high-angle annular dark field  and element-mapping images with a FEI Talos F200S transmission electron microscope  We prepared the perovskite sample for TEM observations with a focused ion beam ( FEI Scios ) ; protective layers of C and Pt were deposited before ion-beam cutting and etching  We recorded XRD patterns using a D8 Advance diffractometer ( Bruker AXS )  Ultraviolet/visible and steady-state photoluminescence spectra were acquired using a Flame spectrometer ( Ocean Optics ) in a glovebox  We measured PLQYs using a blue excitation laser ( 405 nm )  an integrating sphere and a Flame spectrometer  Photoluminescence decay curves were measured using a fluorescence lifetime imaging microscope ( FLIM  Leca TCS SP8 ) with a pulsed excitation laser of 405 nm  Performance evaluation of perovskite LEDs We inserted the as-fabricated perovskite LED devices into a home-made test socket and took measurements in a glovebox ( Supplementary Information  videos S2 and S3  from which we can see that the luminance loss caused by light absorbance and reflection of the glove box glass is 16 % )  Using a Keithley 2400 instrument  we measured J–V data from 0 V to 5 V with a step voltage of 02 V and delay time of 3 s ; simultaneously  we measured the luminance using a luminance meter ( Konica Minolta  LS-160 or CS-200 )  Electroluminescence characteristics were recorded with a Flame spectrometer ( Ocean Optic )  The current efficiency was calculated by dividing the luminance by the current density  The EQE was calculated using Lambertian emission profiles and the obtained electroluminescence spectra  The initial high-performance device with an EQE of 16 % was first investigated by the Nanyang Technological University group ; the electroluminscence characteristics were further studied there as well  Measurement of device lifetime by accelerated ageing Prior studies have shown that the product of the initial luminance ( L0 ) of the lifetime measurement and the T50 lifetime ( defined as the time when the luminance drops to 50 % of L0 ) is a constant :  where the n is the acceleration factor  The n factor can be determined experimentally by running lifetime tests for different L0 values  The equation can be rewritten in the form : logT50 = K – nlogL0  In this way  n is obtained as the slope of the linear fitting curve of the various measured T50 and L0 values  Measurement of operational lifetime ( constant luminance ) As shown in Supplementary Information  video S4  we could maintain the luminance of our perovskite LED devices at around 100 cd cm−2 by carefully tuning the applied current  In other words  we had to increase the applied current a little bit once an obvious decrease in luminance was observed  The device worked steadily for around 46 h  and then began to degrade rapidlyontactless measurements of photocarrier transport properties in perovskite

properties of metal halide perovskites arising from their impressive charge carrier diffusion lengths have led to rapid advances in solution-processed optoelectronics  Unfortunately  diffusion lengths reported in perovskite single crystals have ranged widely – from 3 μm to 3 mm – for ostensibly similar materials  Here we report a contactless method to measure the carrier mobility and further extract the diffusion length : our approach avoids both the effects of contact resistance and those of high electric field  We vary the density of quenchers – epitaxially included within perovskite single crystals – and report the dependence of excited state lifetime in the perovskite on inter-quencher spacing  Our results are repeatable and self-consistent ( ie  they agree on diffusion length for many different quencher concentrations ) to within ± 6 %  Using this method  we obtain a diffusion length in metal-halide perovskites of 26 μm ± 01 μm  Similar content being viewed by others

December 2023 Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells–compositions for improved stability and power conversion efficiency Article 22 November 2023 Introduction Solution-processed photovoltaic materials have facilitated the emergence of third generation solar cell technology with low cost  high efficiency  and flexibility  Thin film solar cells employing metal-halide perovskites have achieved an exceptional 237 % certified power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) 1  In order to reach high PCEs  the active layers must achieve an extended diffusion length ( Ld ) – the distance over which the limiting photocarrier diffuses before it recombines23  Single crystals are an ideal platform for studying the ultimate potential of a material  for they are not limited by morphology and grain boundaries  The electrical properties of halide perovskite single crystals have been investigated extensively in recent years  with charge carrier mobilities  Ld  and trap densities reported using a variety of methods  By probing the photocurrent in solar cell devices  or by combining space charge limited current measurements with optical measurements  researchers have reported electron diffusion lengths inside perovskite crystals  The range has been between 175 μm and 3 mm4 using these approaches  In contrast  Shi et al  reported Ld using mobility measured from electrical methods such as time-of-flight ( TOF ) transient photocurrent and Hall effect measurement5 ; when they combined the drift mobility with the photocarrier lifetime obtained from transient photoluminescence  the authors estimated the diffusion length of MAPbBr3 perovskite single crystal to reside in the range between 3 to 17 μm  One of the challenges that may explain these order-of-magnitude discrepancies is that Hall effect  TOF  and SCLC all probe mobilities near the respective Fermi levels during the experiment – and the ( nonequilibrium  high-injection-level ) Fermi level is widely different in each case  As a result  different mobility-limiting trap densities and depths are sampled  PL lifetime is acquired under a different set of conditions involving low-level or high-level injection  depending on the excitation pulse intensity  The quasi-Fermi level of the relevant charge carrier in the PL component of these studies may differ from that during the electronic injection based transport studies6  Contactless methods including transient microwave conductivity ( TRMC ) and transient terahertz conductivity ( THz ) spectroscopy have been utilized to study the transport properties of perovskite thin films and single crystals789101112131415161718192021  These methods are not widely available in the average optoelectronic materials research lab ; whereas transient absorption and especially photoluminescence are more broadly disseminated ( Supplementary Table 1 )  We pursued the development of a method to measure diffusion lengths of perovskite single crystal directly and straightforwardly  The technique is based on a 3D diffusion-quenching method2223 : it measures the rate at which the nonequilibrium carrier distribution is diminished by spatial diffusion toward luminescent reporters epitaxially embedded in the perovskite  Results Figure 1a illustrates a 1D-diffusion model for an entirely optical method  where a thin film is interfaced with a carrier ( electron or hole  electron as an example here ) quenching layer  Carriers are photogenerated at the active layer/substrate side  diffuse towards the other side  and then are quenched before recombination in the perovskite takes place  By solving the 1D diffusion equation with the sample thickness ( L0 ) and quench-limited diffusion time ( τ0 )  the diffusion coefficient D can be acquired  The diffusion length Ld can therefore be calculated using ( Eq  1 )  where τ stands for the carrier lifetime without the quencher  In this case  a successful fit requires one pair of known parameters ( L0  τ0  τ )  and also a sample thickness shorter than the diffusion length  ( L0 < Ld )  Fig  1 figure 1 Concept of diffusion-quenching models  a 1D diffusion-quenching structure ; carrier funneling process occurs at the interface between the active material and carrier extraction layer  b Configuration of 3D bulk diffusion-quenching model  with quenching sites ( brown spheres ) dispersed inside the bulk of material  Diffusion processes of electrons ( red curve ) and holes ( blue curve ) occur in all three dimensions ( over area of semitransparent large sphere ) Full size image Thick single-crystal perovskites do not lend themselves to the 1D method  for they are many optical absorption lengths thick  We devised instead a method we term 3D quenching with tunable diffusion distances ( Fig  1b )  We utilize homogeneously distributed quenching sites with controllable distance ( L ) inside single crystals  instead of relying on the surface quenching layer used in the 1D method  In our method  diffusion is investigated in all three dimensions ( 3D ) rather than in one dimension ( perpendicular to the quenching layer )  L can be modulated to be shorter than or longer than Ld by varying the quenching material concentration  With several pairs of ( diffusion distance Li  diffusion time τi )  the diffusion coefficient D can be obtained by fitting to the diffusion equation D = L02/τi  One can then validate the method by checking whether the fit remains good – ie  a consistent Ld is obtained from each [ Li  τi ] data set  From a materials design perspective  though quantum dots inside polycrystalline thin film perovskites have been reported24  the study of transport in the absence of perovskite boundaries requires that the dots instead be embedded into perovskite single crystals in a homogenous manner  We needed to develop a synthetic route to incorporate quenching sites into perovskite single crystals in a seamless and homogeneous manner  We pursued a quencher approach that had both type I band alignment with perovskite in order to capture and recombine photocarriers ; and a lattice match with the perovskite so that the crystallinity of the perovskite is retained24  Lead sulfide ( PbS ) QDs have been reported to meet the above requirements when epitaxially grown inside methylammonium lead halide perovskite crystals ( Supplementary Fig  1 ) ; however  quantum dots have not previously been reported as quenchers applied to study the transport properties of perovskite single crystals  We first selected the antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization method to grow perovskite single crystals  The method has previously been shown to produce high quality crystals  a fact attributable to the slow diffusion of the antisolvent into the solvent5 ( Supplementary Fig  2a )  Unfortunately  when we added the perovskite capped PbS QDs during the crystallization process  we did not obtain the desired QD-in-single-crystals ( QDISCs )  Instead  perovskite single crystals in pure phase formed  segregated from the quantum dots  With the goal of synchronizing the crystallization process with the timescale on which QDs maintain their colloidal stability  we changed our strategy of perovskite crystal synthesis  We sought to shorten the crystallization process to 3 h using instead the inverse temperature crystallization ( ITC ) method25 ( Supplementary Fig  2b )  Perovskite single crystals ( Fig  2a  left ) grown via the ITC method have been reported to possess trap densities and transport properties on par with the best reported for MAPbBr3 crystals to date  Fig  2 figure 2 Material platform of quantum dots inside single crystal ( QDISCs )  a Pure MAPbBr3 perovskite crystal ( left ) and QDISCs ( right )  QDISC exhibit the color of PbS quantum dots  b Emission from quantum dots under room light captured by a near-infrared camera  c Absorption and photoluminescence spectrum of QDISCs Full size image With this strategy  we found that  once PbS QDs were added during crystallization  the resultant crystals exhibited a similar color to that of a QD solution ( Fig  2a  dark crystal on the right )  QDISCs show  at the macroscopic level  the same well-defined cubic shape as do the ( dotless ) perovskite single crystals ( Supplementary Fig  3 )  We observed strong infrared luminescence from QDISCs even under room light excitation ( Fig  2b )  The optical absorption spectra of QDISCs in Fig  2c signal the existence of perovskite  with its clear bandedge at around 550 nm  and quantum dots with their excitonic peak at 1000 nm  The steady state photoluminescence spectra of QDISCs show an emission from quantum dots at 1100 nm and  at these dot concentrations  no perovskite emission  The QDs exhibited an absolute photoluminescence efficiency ( PLQE ) of 24 %  This high PLQE of PbS QDs in the solid state surpasses that observed in the best previous reports26  This indicates good passivation by the perovskite and the formation of a type-I heterostructure between QDs and perovskites27  We then turned to study the structural properties of perovskite as a function of QD incorporation  From single crystal XRD measurements  we observed that the crystal structure of the perovskite remains intact following the incorporation of QDs ( Supplementary Fig  3 )  We then carried out grazing incidence X-ray scattering ( GISAXS ) measurements on pure perovskite single crystals and QDISCs having high QD loading ( 60 perovskite:1 QD mass ratio )  The samples show the same characteristic scattering pattern ( 110 ) of MAPbBr3 ( Supplementary Fig  4a and b )  The scattering peak full width half maximum ( FWHM ) of QDISCs closely approaches that of pure perovskite single crystals ( 018 vs 025 nm−1 )  We ascribe the slightly narrower scattering peak in QDISCs to the reduced rate of sample degradation when quantum dots are incorporated  We conclude that  to within the sensitivity limits of the method  the QDISCs exhibit crystallinity comparable to that of the pure-perovskite single crystals ( Supplementary Fig  4c )  To elucidate the interaction between the QDs and perovskite single crystal  we used transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) to probe the microscopic structure of QDISCs ( Supplementary Fig  5a–d )  TEM images were taken from nanosized QDISCs ( Methods )  Figure 3 illustrates that quantum dots separate from each other further with decreasing QD concentration ( from 1:1 to 1:20 mass ratio )  We measured the inter-dot spacing ( L ) for each concentration and plotted the distribution of L ( Fig  3c  d and Supplementary Figs  6–7 )  We further developed a 3-dimensional homogeneous distribution model to reveal the dependence of L on QD concentration ( Methods  Supplementary Fig  8 )  Figure 5e shows that the experimental data agrees well with the simulated results ( with the quantum dots radius equals to 3 nm )  We also carried out the time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry ( TOF-SIMS ) on QDISCs to ascertain whether QDs homogeneously distributed in macroscale single crystals ( Supplementary Fig  9 )  From these studies  we concluded that the diffusion distance L can be accurately modulated by varying the QD concentration  Fig  3 figure 3 Diffusion distance ( L ) extraction  a  b STEM images of quantum dots ( bright dots ) in perovskite single crystals with the mass ratio between QDs and perovskite of 1:1 and 1:20  With the decreasing QD concentration  the inter-dot spacing increases  c  d Statistic distribution of L from over 90 data points from the STEM images  e Calculated L as a function of QD concentration ( grey line )  and experimental data ( yellow points )  The error bars indicate standard deviation of the measured L Full size image We then proceeded to explore measuring the diffusion length using these heterocrystals  First  we varied the diffusion distance Li ( which corresponds to the mean value of the Gaussian distribution of inter-dot spacing ) from 20 to 50 nm by further decreasing the QD concentration ( Fig  4a )  We carried out transient absorption spectroscopy ( TAS ) to study the carrier diffusion time in QDISCs by probing the dynamics of the perovskite bleach  Figure 4b shows that carrier concentration decays faster when we increase the density of QDs ( from 1020:1 to 64:1  perovskite : QDs )  and the shorter diffusion time is consistent with the shorter diffusion distance  We estimated the carrier diffusion lifetime ( τdiff ) by fitting the TA traces using a monoexponential model  It should be noted that the kinetics was simplified and Auger process may result in the deviation from the single exponential decay  especially under high pumping fluence28  We plot it against the diffusion distance Li in Fig  4c  The diffusion distance squared ( Li2 ) shows a clear linear dependence on the diffusion time ( τdiff )  consistent with the application of the diffusion model to the QDISCs material system  Fig  4 figure 4 3D diffusion-quenching measurement on MAPbBr3 single crystals  a Inter-dot spacing tuning via controlling the quantum dot concentration from 64:1 to 1020:1 ( mass ratio between perovskite and QDs  QD radius = 25 nm )  b Transient absorption dynamics at perovskite bleach with different diffusion distance ( limited by inter-dot spacing )  c Fitting of diffusion coefficient and carrier mobility of MAPbBr3 single crystals  d Carrier lifetime and diffusion length calculation of MAPbBr3 single crystals Full size image From the slope of the Li2-τdiff plot  we extract a diffusion coefficient ( D ) for the perovskite of 007 cm2 s−1  From the Einstein relation : D = μ∙kB∙T/q ( Eq  2 )  where μ  kB  T and q stand for mobility  Boltzmann ’ s constant  temperature  and electrical charge  respectively  we calculate a perovskite carrier mobility of 27 cm2V−1s−1  The transient absorption lifetime is determined by the type of carriers ( electron or hole ) that diffuse more slowly  The resulting estimated mobility corresponds thus to that of the transport-limiting carrier29  In order to obtain the diffusion length limited by trap-assisted recombination  we needed to measure the carrier lifetime ( τ ) of the pristine perovskite single crystals  The photoluminescence lifetime ( τPL ) in MAPbBr3 single crystals is limited by non-radiative recombination ( which we know from the low PL quantum yield of this material even in its pure phase )  so we can estimate the trap-limited carrier lifetime τ using transient photoluminescence spectroscopy ( Fig  4d )  When we combine the carrier lifetime and diffusion coefficient  we obtain a diffusion length of 26 μm  corresponding to a defect density ( Ntrap ) of 6 × 1010 cm−3  Perovskite thin film absorbers with mixed cations and anions have attracted increasing attention due to their greater efficiency and stability than mono-compositional counterparts30313233  We deployed our technique therefore also on thin films based on mixed cation perovskites  We successfully incorporated QDs into both one-step34 and two-step26 synthesized films with different components : one-step Cs005MA014FA081PbI255Br045 and two-step MAPbBr017I083 thin films  We varied Li by changing the QD concentration  and we then fit Li2 against τdiff ( Fig  5b–d ) with a linear function using the same methods as previously discussed in this manuscript  We combined knowledge of the decay times in the pure perovskite films synthesized with different methods ( τ = 790 ns and 90 ns respectively ) ( Supplementary Fig  10 )  and estimated a diffusion length of 720 nm ( Cs005MA014FA081PbI255Br045 ) and 230 nm ( MAPbBr017I083 )  respectively  Fig  5 figure 5 3D diffusion-quenching measurement on perovskite thin films  a SEM image of MAPbBr017I083 perovskite thin film synthesized using 2-step method  b Fitting of diffusion coefficient and carrier mobility of MAPbBr017I083 perovskite thin films  c SEM image of perovskite thin film with mixed cations and anions ( Cs005MA014FA081PbI255Br045 ) synthesized using 1-step method and d fitting of coefficient and carrier mobility accordingly Full size image Compared to perovskite single crystals  polycrystalline thin films exhibit ten times lower carrier mobilities  As we only probe the diffusion-quenching that occurs within each perovskite grain  we attribute this lower mobility to a greater density of defects within grains  which might be introduced due to the faster crystallization kinetics  Interestingly  we observed similar mobilities between the two thin film perovskites  but the diffusion length of the one-step perovskite with mixed cations and anions ( Cs005MA014FA081PbI255Br045 ) is 3 times longer than the two-step perovskite thin film ( MAPbBr017I083 )  The results indicate similar bulk defect densities exist in both perovskites  but the surface defect density is much lower in Cs005MA014FA081PbI255Br045  This observation agrees well with the fact that the grain size of Cs005MA014FA081PbI255Br045 is larger than that of MAPbBr017I083 ( Fig  5a–c )  Discussion In sum  the present work provides an entirely optical and contactless method to study carrier mobility  lifetime  and diffusion length in perovskite single crystals  The measurement of these parameters in both single crystal and different types of thin film perovskites are poised to contribute to increased understanding and design of high-performance optoelectronic devices  Methods Quantum dots in perovskite hybrids synthesis Lead sulfide ( PbS ) quantum dots were synthesized and then ligand exchanged using previously reported method26  Specifically  3 mL of quantum dots ( 10 mg mL−1 ) in octane were added into 3 mL dimethylformamide ( DMF ) solution containing PbI2 ( 350 mg ) and MAI ( 120 mg )  After the mixed solution was stirred for 15 mins  the quantum dots transferred from the top octane solution to the bottom DMF solution  The octane was then removed  followed by three more washes with octane  to completely remove the organic residue  The quantum dots were then precipitated with toluene and dried under vacuum for 10 mins  After removing the solvent by vacuum  the exchanged quantum dot powder was weighed and then dispersed in the perovskite precursor solution in DMF ( MAPbBr3 in DMF with 1 M concentration )  The crystals of hybrid quantum dots in perovskite formed when slowly increasing the temperature of the solvent from 60 to 120 ℃11  The solvent was kept at 120 ℃ for 3 h ; then the crystals were collected and dried with nitrogen gas  By changing the mass ratio of quantum dots to perovskite precursor  the interdot spacing can be modulated  The antisolvent diffusion method was also conducted  by placing a vial of the mixed quantum dots and perovskite precursor crystallization solution in a sealed container  with antisolvent ( dichloromethane ) inside the container and slowly diffusing into the DMF solution  After several days  the pure crystals of MAPbBr3 grew while the quantum dots precipitated at the bottom of the solution  phase separating from the perovskite crystal  Photoluminescence measurement Photoluminescence measurements were performed using a Horiba Fluorolog Time Correlated Single Photon Counting system with photomultiplier tube detectors  A monochromatized Xe lamp and pulsed laser diodes were used as excitation sources for steady-state and transient measurements  respectively  The time resolution of the transient measurements were limited by the instrument response function of approximately 013 ns  In order to reduce the effect of reabsorption in the measurement of carrier lifetime of pure perovskite single crystals  we used reflection mode  In reflection mode  most PL signal was generated and collected close to the crystal surface  Absolute PLQE measurements were carried out in a Quanta-Phi integrating sphere according to standard methods published elsewhere35  where excitation and emission spectra are measured for the sample directly and indirectly illuminated  The measurements inside integrating sphere takes into account the effect of reabsorption and reflection of the samples  TA measurement A regeneratively amplified Yb : KGW laser ( Light Conversion Pharos ) was used to generate femtosecond pulses ( 1030 nm  5 kHz )  A portion of this pulse was passed through an optical parametric amplifier ( Light Conversion Orpheus )  generating pump pulses of 450 nm light  The pump and remainder of the fundamental were sent into an optical bench ( Ultrafast Helios )  where the frequency of the pump was halved to 25 kHz with an optical chopper  The time delay between pulses was controlled by sending the fundamental through a delay stage ; after which  the fundamental was focused onto a near-IR continuum generation crystal ( Ultrafast )  producing a white-light continuum probe pulse in both the visible and near-IR regions  For the quantum dots in perovskite single crystal samples  the experiments were carried out in reflection mode  where the probe was reflected from the surface of the single crystals and directed toward the detector ( Ultrafast Helios )  The sample was fixed at the sample holder  and  depending on the strength of the signal  a number of bidirectional scans were averaged to assist with lowering the noise  The power of the pump pulse was set to 11 µW for 450 nm and 225 µW for 1000 nm  For the quantum dots in perovskite thin film samples  the experiments were conducted in transmission mode  with the sample translated at 1 mm/s to reduce the noise  TEM measurement Since the QDISCs are in mm scale  it is difficult to fabricate the ultra-thin ( thickness < 50 nm ) samples that are suitable for TEM measurement  Alternatively  we turned to synthesize nanosized QDISCs  Specifically  quantum dots in perovskite precursor solution ( see details in 1  Quantum dots in perovskite hybrids synthesis ) were spin coated onto a plasma-treated TEM grid  with the spin speed of 3000 rpm for 60 s 200 μL of toluene were added during spinning ( after 5 s )  Then the films were directly transferred to a hotplate and annealed at 90 ℃ for 10 min  All the thin-film fabrication processes were carried out in a N2 filled glovebox  For TEM measurement  we synthesized a set of samples with different QD concentration : pure perovskite  QD to perovskite mass ratio of 1:1  1:5  1:10  and 1:20  STEM images were obtained using a Hitachi HF 3300 electron microscope with a cold field emission electron source ( energy spread from 045 to 07 eV ) operating at 300 keV and in bright-field ( BF ) and high-angle annular dark-field ( HAADF ) modes  TOF-SIMS measurement TOF-SIMS study was conducted by the ToF-SIMS5 from ION-TOF GmbH ( Munster  Germany )  Samples were measured in a dual beam profiling mode  The primary ion was 30 keV Bi3+  This ion beam was applied over a 200 × 200 µm area at the center of a 400 × 400 µm sputter crater  The sputter ion was 1 keV Ar+  Spectral data were acquired in a high mass-resolution mode  All profiles were performed in non-interlaced mode  Diffusion distance ( L ) calculation and experimental extraction The inter-dots spacing used in this work is defined as the distance between the center of the nearby two quantum dots which are homogeneously dispersed in a three-dimensional perovskite matrix  In order to quantify the diffusion distance L of the carrier traveling through  which is practically limited by the inter-dots spacing  we developed the following model ( Supplementary Fig  6a )  The quantum dots with the radius of r ( red spheres ) are assumed to be homogeneously dispersed in the perovskite single crystals with the inter-dots spacing of L The densities of PbS quantum dots and MAPbBr3 perovskite are and  Per unit cell of the QDISCs  there is one full quantum dots with the mass of : ( 1 ) and the mass of the perovskite is : ( 2 ) We define the mass ratio between quantum dots and perovskite as : ( 3 ) with X as a variable that can be modulated experimentally to control the inter-dots distance L Combining Eq  S1–3  we can get the inter-dots spacing as a function of X as below : ( 4 ) Supplementary Fig  6b illustrate the L–X relation in the cases of using quantum dots with different sizes  In all experiments reported in this work  we used QD with the size of 3 nm  We used TEM to identify QDs and perovskite matrix : due to the density contrast  QDs correspond to dark dots in bright-field  and bright dots in dark-field ( Supplementary Fig  3a  b )  While for pure perovskite crystals  TEM images only reveal contrast from perovskite  For the purpose for the inter-dot spacing measurement  we identified the QDs from the dark-field images  We prepared 4 different concentrations for nanosized QDISC samples  with the mass ratio between perovskite to quantum dots ranging from 1:1 to 20:1  For each concentration  we collected a data set composing 90 data points of inter-dot spacing with statistical analysis presented next to the TEM images ( Supplementary Figs  4–5 )  In order to enhance the accuracy of the inter-dots spacing  we only took the thin sample with few tens of nanometer thickness into account  In this way  the 2D projection is closer to the actual space distribution of QDs in 3 dimensional  Data availability The data that support the plots within this paper and other findings of this study are

Interfacial modification in perovskite-based tandem solar cells Article Open access 20 May 2023 Introduction Tandem solar cells consisting of multiple absorber layers with different bandgaps reduce thermalization losses and offer a further increase in the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of single-junction cells1  For perovskite solar cells ( PSCs )  single-junction device PCEs have increased from 38 to 252 % over the course of a decade23  As these devices usually employ materials having a bandgap of 15–17 eV  they are also particularly attractive as top cells in tandem devices  They can be coupled with perovskite45  organic6  colloidal quantum dot ( CQD ) 789  crystalline silicon1011  and copper indium gallium selenide ( CIGS ) 1213 solar cells in both two-terminal ( 2T ) and four-terminal ( 4T ) configurations  The 4T tandem arrangement offers a broader bandgap selection window for the constituent cells114  Perovskite-silicon 4T tandem solar cells recently reported in the literature have reached an impressive PCE of 271 % 15  Efficient harvesting of the photons above the bandgap of each subcell is needed to realize the potential of the tandem concept16  To this end  both front and back electrodes of the top cell need to be highly transparent to allow near-infrared ( NIR ) photons to reach the bottom cell ; and such a configuration reduces the internal reflection of photons close to the perovskite bandedge  making the achievement of high absorption of above-bandgap photons in the top cell challenging—for this must be accomplished in a single pass through the active layer  In general  the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of efficient single-junction perovskite cells with opaque rear-mirror contacts ( metal ) is above 80 % near the bandedge171819  while that of semi-transparent cells show a lower value ( around 70 % ) in the same spectral range413202122  Employing high-quality and thick active layers to overcome insufficient photon absorption has advanced Sn-based perovskite solar cells4523 ; however  for Pb-based perovskites  thick films exhibit inhomogeneous morphologies2425 and limited carrier diffusion lengths262728  Here  we find that the formation of a wrinkled surface in thick perovskite films is due to the high precursor concentration used in the conventional solution processing method  We develop a technique  which we term boosted solvent extraction  that enables a homogeneous and smooth morphology in perovskite films having an increased optical path length  Carrier extraction is still limited in thick films made using the method ; but we show that the addition of a Lewis base decreases the trap density and enhances the electron diffusion length so that it exceeds 2 µm  As a result  we report a semi-transparent perovskite top cell that provides a stabilized PCE of 19 % and an average NIR transmittance ( 800–1100 nm ) of 85 %  As bottom cells  CQD : organic hybrid cells and silicon heterojunction ( SHJ ) cells are tailored to enhance their NIR photocurrent generation  With these top and bottom cells  we achieve a PCE of 24 % in perovskite/CQD tandems and 282 % in perovskite/silicon tandems  Results Estimating optical loss in semi-transparent perovskite cells To quantify the additional optical losses originating from using transparent conductive electrodes ( TCEs ) as back electrodes  we employed transfer-matrix methods ( TMM ) simulations in rear-mirror and semi-transparent devices  We calculated the response for PSCs made of three most commonly used perovskite compositions  These devices show 8–10 % current loss for semi-transparent devices in the typical thickness range of 300–500 nm29 as implemented in PSCs ( Supplementary Fig  1 )  which can be reduced to below 2 % when the semi-transparent devices are around 300 nm thicker than their opaque counterparts  We conclude that thick films with sufficiently long carrier diffusion length may enable high-efficiency semi-transparent cells  Forming thick perovskite films with smooth morphology We focused on the triple-cation Cs005FA081MA014PbI255Br045 ( CsFAMA ) perovskite because of its high-performance in opaque rear-mirrored devices and lower chances to form a rough surface1925303132  For spin-coated perovskite films  there are two ways to increase thickness33  When we increased perovskite precursor solution concentration  the transition from intermediate states to the perovskite phase is fast because of the high supersaturation of precursor solution and rapid perovskite reaction rate during subsequent thermal annealing3435  However  such a quick intermediate to perovskite phase transition induces compressive stress because of sudden volume change during the process  resulting in films with a rough and wrinkled surface2425  as shown in Fig  1a–c  Despite the increased average thickness of the films from 400 to 700 nm  the high surface roughness and a significant amount of PbI2 precipitation negatively affect the device performance ( Fig  1e–g )  Another option is decreasing the spin-coating speed  The combination of 14 M precursor with reduced spinning rotation per minute ( RPM ) results in around 700 nm thickness perovskite film with a smoother surface ( Fig  1d  f )  However  the performance improvement is modest and PCE still trails that of 400 nm devices ( Fig  1g )  Fig  1 : Morphology and photovoltaic performance of perovskite films prepared by different precursor concentrations  figure 1 a–d Optical microscope images and corresponding fast Fourier transform ( FFT ) of perovskite films prepared by different methods ( λ is the wrinkling wavelength )  Scale bar : 10 µm  e XRD patterns and f surface morphology of perovskite films  Error bars are standard deviations of ten locations in SEM cross-sectional images for thickness and of root mean squared ( RMS ) analysis from AFM images for roughness  g Corresponding PCE values ( 12 devices each )  Full size image Scanning electron microsope ( SEM ) images reveal pinholes in perovskite films prepared by low spin-coating speed ( control )  a finding previously reported to arise due to insufficient nucleation ( Fig  2a ) 34  For the one-step perovskite fabrication method  the crystallization kinetics are largely dependent on the anti-solvent dripping process  We reasoned that the slower rotation speed makes it challenging to yield compact films  The narrow anti-solvent dripping time windows ( for a burst of intermediate phase nucleation ) 1734 require fast spreading and quick evaporation of anti-solvent across the surface of the spinning film  which is not achievable at low RPM  The reduced centrifugal force decreases the lateral flow of the anti-solvent and hence the ability to spin-off excess polar solvents  As a result  the transition from perovskite precursor solution to solid-state intermediate phase is incomplete  Due to the inhomogeneous supersaturation across the whole spinning substrate  only a small portion of the converted film is ready for perovskite-phase formation  Indeed  sparse perovskite phases are observed across the substrate  which translates to a less compact perovskite film with pinholes after thermal annealing ( Fig  2d )  Fig  2 : Morphology and photovoltaic performance of perovskite films prepared by boosted solvent extraction ( BSE ) and non-BSE methods  figure 2 a  b SEM images of perovskite films prepared using non-BSE and BSE methods ; all images are acquired following thermal annealing  d  e Optical microscope images showing perovskite films prepared by

width at half maximum  f JV curves of devices based on the BSE and non-BSE perovskite films  Full size image This led us to the view that the fast removal of excess solvent coupled with low-speed spinning could potentially produce thicker films with a homogenous morphology  In this approach  we raised the spin-coating speed to higher RPM precisely 1 s before anti-solvent dripping  This was intended to increase the lateral hydrodynamic flow and evaporation rate of the mixed solvents to facilitate the rapid nucleation of the intermediate phase  The goal of the technique—which we term boosted solvent extraction ( BSE ) —was to form homogeneous and smooth films at reduced spin speed ( Supplementary Fig  2 )  The films prepared by the BSE technique show a more compact morphology ( Fig  2b  e ) with lower surface roughness ( Supplementary Fig  3 )  X-ray diffraction patterns of intermediate phases in the unannealed control film show broader peak widths  which also indicate the existence of excess solvent  as the local structural order of the intermediate phase can be disturbed by DMSO/DMF over-incorporation ( Fig  2c )  The improved surface morphology of BSE films enables a better photovoltaic performance and paves the way for subsequent studies ( Fig  2e )  We then prepared perovskite films with thicknesses ranging from 400 to 700 nm ( Fig  3a–c ) ; the corresponding devices demonstrate the anticipated Jsc improvements  as evidenced by the EQE spectra in Fig  3f  The EQE integrated Jsc values are 193  201  21  218 mA cm−2 for semi-transparent devices with absorber thickness of 400  500  600  and 700 nm  respectively  Three phenomena are observed : ( 1 ) the increased Jsc values of thicker devices are a direct result of the enhanced EQE in the wavelength range from 500 to 780 nm  as compared to a 400 nm thick control device  ( 2 ) Semi-transparent devices do not show interference features due to the minimized back reflection  which is evident in opaque rear-mirror devices  ( 3 ) Interference only happens between the 550 and 750 nm wavelength range  due to the reduced absorption coefficient of the perovskite layer at the band edge  compared to the Beer-Lambert regime for short wavelengths ( below 500 nm ) 36  The EQE difference of devices with respect to the control cell shows that 500  600  and 700 nm thick devices gain an integrated Jsc of 08  17  and 25 mA cm−2  respectively ( Fig  3g )  The improved Jsc results confirm that the thickness of the perovskite absorber is critical to enhancing light harvesting in the semi-transparent devices by compensating for the loss from using TCEs as rear electrodes  Fig  3 : Effects of perovskite thickness on photon collection  figure 3 a–d Top and cross-sectional SEM views of perovskite films with

EQE spectra between thicker perovskite devices compared to control device with 400 nm thickness  Full size image Reducing traps in thick perovskites films Short carrier diffusion lengths have been a limiting factor for thick films perovskite devices262728  We found that the reduced carrier lifetime in 700 nm films ( Fig  4a ) was correlated to the multi-grain structure between the charge transport layers ( Fig  3c )  This led us to believe that a lower density of grain boundaries could help improve carrier transport  since they are regarded as trapping sites for carrier recombination373839  We employed urea  a Lewis base additive  in an attempt to increase the grain size35  Figure 3e shows the statistical distribution of the apparent lateral grain size from SEM of perovskite films fabricated under different conditions39  Urea-treated 700 nm thick perovskite films exhibit a larger apparent grain size ( 700 nm-large )  averaging 13 µm compared to 06 µm without any additive ( 700 nm-small )  The larger grain enables a single perovskite domain structure through the vertical direction of the active layer ( Fig  3d )  We obtained the 1D carrier diffusion length ( LD ) with the aid of time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy ( TRPL ) 4041  The 700 nm-small films show greatly reduced carrier collection efficiency compared to the 400 nm reference film  evident from the longer carrier lifetime ( from 46 to 162 ns ) in spiro-OMeTAD-quenched TRPL measurement ( Fig  4b )  However  the 700 nm-large film recovers the fast quenching observed in the thinner sample  by reducing the lifetime to 46 ns  In the ETL-quenching experiment using phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM )  the 700 nm-large film shows the fastest PL decay at 180 ns  suggesting the best electron extraction efficiency among the three films ( Fig  4c )  By comparing the quenched and unquenched TRPL lifetimes  we found that LD of the hole is estimated to be over 1000 nm for all films and not a limiting factor for carrier transport  On the contrary  LD of the electron in 700 nm-small films is calculated to be only 571 ± 10 nm  which is shorter than its thickness and considerably less than that of 700 nm-large films ( 2347 ± 46 nm )  Fig  4 : Effects of grain size on carrier transport and trap density in thick perovskite  figure 4 a Non-quenched  b spiro-OMeTAD  and c PCBM-quenched time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements on perovskite films  d Transient photocurrent  e photovoltage decay and f Space charge limited current of 700 nm perovskite devices with various grain sizes  Full size image The 700 nm-large devices show a higher average reverse scan PCE of 184 %  compared to 173 % for the same thickness but smaller grain size ( Supplementary Fig  4a )  While the Jsc does not change  the advantages of enhanced grain size are readily seen in the improved open-circuit voltage ( Voc ) and fill factor ( FF )  The longer carrier diffusion length in the 700 nm-large film leads to an improved FF of 75 from 72 %  Fast transient photocurrent ( TPC ) decay confirms the improvement of charge collection in the treated device ( Fig  4d )  Fewer grain boundaries in the vertical direction reduce carrier recombination  as evidenced by the longer transient photovoltage ( TPV ) lifetime ( Fig  4e ) and smaller trap-filled limit voltage ( VTFL ) from space charge limited current ( SCLC ) measurement ( Fig  4f )  in electron-only devices ( ITO/SnO2/Perovskite/PCBM/Ag )  resulting in a Voc increase of 20 meV  A benefit related to TCEs compared to metal electrodes is improved device operation stability424344  In our semi-transparent cells  TCEs are implemented as working electrodes and also act as effective sealants  protecting our devices  Both large-grain and small-grain devices show good operational stability  retaining performance to within 75 % of initial ( post-burn-in ) performance following more than 1000 h under AM15 G maximum power point ( MPP ) tracking in N2 atmosphere period ( Supplementary Fig  4b )  Large-grain devices show slightly better stability than the small grain counterpart  most likely due to the reduced grain boundaries  which are vulnerable to moisture ingress34  The champion device exhibits a 19 % stabilized power output ( Supplementary Fig  4c )  To the best of our knowledge  this is by far the most efficient semi-transparent solar cells reported  with 85 % average transmittance in the NIR region ( Supplementary Fig  4d )  One of the key enablers of high NIR transmittance is replacing commercial ITO with previously-developed highly-conductive Zr-doped In2O3 ( IZrO ) TCOs  whose parasitic free carrier absorption is suppressed  for a given free carrier density  by virtue of its enhanced carrier mobility ( Supplementary Fig  5 ) 45  Designing efficient bottom cell structures Bottom cells that have strong and spectrally broad absorption beyond the perovskite bandedge  are crucial to the realization of highly efficient tandem solar cells  We used a solution-processed bottom cell : a colloidal quantum dot ( CQD ) : organic hybrid structure  We took advantage of the bandgap tunability of PbS CQDs across visible to infrared wavelengths ( 07–13 eV ) via size-control46 and their high EQEs ( 80 % near 1100 nm ) 47  which makes them suitable for bottom cells in a tandem configuration  In addition  we stacked NIR-sensitizing organic molecules to complement the intrinsic absorption deficiency of CQDs near the excitonic valley  For that purpose  emerging non-fullerene acceptors ( NFA )  IEICO-4F ( 22′- ( ( 2Z2′Z ) - ( ( ( 4499-tetrakis ( 4-hexylphenyl ) -49-dihydro-s-indaceno [ 12-b:56-b′ ] dithiophene-27-diyl ) bis ( 4- ( ( 2-ethylhexyl ) oxy ) thiophene-52-diyl ) ) bis ( methanylylidene ) ) bis ( 56-difluoro-3-oxo-23-dihydro-1H-indene-21-diylidene ) ) dimalononitrile )  is combined with the CQDs  forming the CQD/organic hybrid structure48  Absorbance spectra demonstrate that IEICO-4F exhibits strong absorption across 600–1000 nm  which complements the CQD absorption ( Fig  5a )  Fig  5 : NIR-tailored design for bottom cells  figure 5 a

130 %  the highest solar cell efficiency among CQDs and CQD : organic hybrids49  Jsc was improved from 286 to 313 mA cm−2  a relative enhancement of 95 % which is in good agreement with estimates from simulations ( Supplementary Fig  6 )  We acquired spectral responses to confirm the origin of Jsc improvement ( Fig  5c )  The hybrid devices showed improved EQE from 700 to 900 nm  where the NFA absorbs ( Supplementary Fig  7 )  Overall  the EQE is over 80 % up to 1150 nm  indicating that CQD : organic hybrid structures are advantageous as bottom cells for tandem applications  We applied a similar design strategy of tailored NIR photon collection to SHJ cells  In the 4T configuration  the silicon bottom cell works at low current density due to the filtering by the perovskite top cell  To maximize the current output  we designed a specific contact geometry that minimizes the shadowing losses at a low light intensity  preserving at the same time optimal contact properties  In doing this  we decreased the number of metal fingers to reach an overall 25 % metal coverage ratio  To improve the NIR response of the devices  we replaced the ITO electrode with H-doped In2O3 ( In2O3 : H ) to reduce free-carrier absorption ( Fig  5d )  at the cost of increased reflection in the blue ( Fig  5e )  Fortunately  this reflection does not result in a performance loss on the overall 4T tandem solar cells since the majority of the blue part of the spectrum is already absorbed by the perovskite top cells  By taking into account all of these improvements  the spectral response of the SHJ cell maximizes the NIR absorption ( 700–1200 nm ) at the expense of decreased efficiency in the visible ( 400–600 nm ) range  leading to an improved Jsc from the SHJ as a bottom cell compared to the reference SHJ designed to work at one sun condition ( Fig  5f )  Encouraged by CQD : organic hybrid and silicon bottom cells with improved NIR responses  we stacked these with BSE and grain-engineered semi-transparent top cells to form 4T tandem cells ( Fig  6a )  Figure 6b  c combine the 4T EQE spectrum and JV curves of each constituent cell in the 4T structure  The PV parameters are summarized in Table 1  The perovskite/CQD system demonstrates highly efficient photon-harvesting capability as an all-solution processed tandem  yielding a Jsc of 345 mA cm2 and a PCE of 24 %  The perovskite/silicon pair synergistically generates a current density of 395 mA cm2 in tandem  leading to a PCE of 282 %  which is the highest in the perovskite-silicon tandem category ( Fig  6d and Supplementary Table 1 )  We also fabricated 1 cm2 size tandem  which yields a PCE of 257 %  This is limited by fill factor due to increased series resistance from TCEs in the semi-transparent PSC ( Supplementary Fig  8 )  and it will in future become important to incorporate metal fingers as busbars  Fig  6 : Design and photovoltaic performance of mechanically stacked tandem solar cells  figure

Discussion The transparency requirement of semi-transparent solar cells  taken together with the lower extinction coefficient near the absorption bandedge of perovskite film  calls for different design rules from those employed in conventional single-junction devices  The boosted solvent extraction technique allows us to extend the optical path length in semi-transparent perovskite cells  By then enhancing the electron diffusion length to overcome decreased carrier transport in thicker films  we achieved 19 % PCE semi-transparent top cells with minimized current loss compared to opaque rear-mirrored devices  The improved NIR response in bottom cells allowed us to demonstrate superior photon collection in all-solution-processed tandems with perovskite/CQD devices ( 345 mA cm2 )  and the highest PCE among literature-reported perovskite/silicon tandem cells ( 282 % )  Methods Materials Commercial ITO substrates ( 20 Ω sq−1 ) with 25 mm × 25 mm dimension were purchased from TFD Inc

layer fabrication was prepared by diluting ( 1:6 ratio ) the SnO2 nanoparticles solution ( Alfa Asear ) in deionized water  This solution is spin-coated on the ITO substrates with 3000 RPM for 15 s and annealed at 150 °C for 30 min  Before spin-coating  ITO substrates were treated in O2 plasma for 10 min  Perovskite absorber layer fabrication The perovskite absorber layers were deposited inside the N2-filled glove box with a controlled H2O and oxygen level to less than 1 PPM  The temperature inside was monitored to be 25–28 °C  The precursors for Cs005FA081MA014PbI255Br045 perovskites were prepared by dissolving the PbI2  PbBr2  CsI  FAI  and MABr in DMF : DMSO ( 4:1 in volume ) solvents  as previously reported19  For Lewis-base treated perovskite films  5–10 mg mL−1 urea was added in the perovskite precursor solutions  For high RPM devices  the substrate was spun at 1000 RPM for 10 s with an acceleration of 200 RPM at first  and then at 6000 RPM for the 50 s with an acceleration

an acceleration of 2000 RPM  For the third step  RPM is set to 6000 with the acceleration of 10000 RPM s−1 for 5 s  and 150 μL chlorobenzene was dropped onto the substrate immediately after RPM reached 6000  The substrate was immediately placed on a hotplate and annealed at 100 °C for 25 min  Hole-transport layer ( HTL ) fabrication The HTM ( Spiro-OMeTAD ) was deposited immediately after the fabrication of perovskite films  Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 675 mg Spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL chlorobenzene  Then 35 μL LiTFSI solution ( 350 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile ) and 25 μL tBP were added  This solution was spun at 4000 RPM for 30 s on perovskite films  Then the samples were kept in dry box with desiccant overnight at dark for oxidation  Back electrode fabrication Ten

sputtering chamber was Ar mixed with 04 % O2 at 15 SCCM  The resultant IZO films have sheet resistance of 30–50 Ω sq−1  Ten nanometer of MoO3 was thermally evaporated at a rate of 02 Å s−1 onto Spiro-OMeTAD layer as a buffer layer before IZO sputtering  CQD : organic hybrids bottom cell fabrication Oleic acid-capped PbS CQDs ( 1st excitonic peak at 950 nm ) were prepared as previously described9  For the fabrication of hybrid devices  a ZnO nanoparticle solution was spun onto a pre-cleaned ITO substrate at 3000 RPM for 20 s twice  forming a 150 nm-thick layer  For CQD layer  CQDs were exchanged by the PbX2/NH4Ac solution-phase ligand-exchange process  ( PbI2 : 01 M and PbBr2 : 002 M and NH4Ac : 004 M )  Exchanged dots are precipitated and dried in the vacuum chamber for 10 min  followed by re-dispersion in butylamine ( BTA ) at a concentration of 330 mg mL−1  Prepared CQD inks spun onto ZnO layer at 2500 RPM for 30 s After one-day air drying  an organic solution ( PTB7-Th : IEICO-4F = 1:4  12 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene:1-chloronaphthalene = 96:4 wt % ) was deposited at 2000 RPM for 60 s followed by drying process at 80 °C for 5 min  Finally  the MoO3 ( 10 nm ) /Ag ( 120 nm ) electrode was deposited using thermal evaporation under a high vacuum ( below 10−6 Torr ) through a 0053 cm2 area shadow mask  Fabrication of the silicon bottom cell SHJ bottom cells were fabricated on float-zone double-side-textured four inches wafers ( n-doped  resistivity 1 to 5 Ω cm−1  thickness 250–280 µm )  The texturing process was done in an alkaline solution to get randomly distributed pyramids  Subsequently  the wafers were cleaned in RCA1 and RCA2 solution  Prior to the PECVD depositions  the wafers were dipped in 5 % hydrofluoric acid solution to remove the native oxide layer  Then  the wafers were passivated on both sides with an intrinsic layer of amorphous silicon ( i ) followed by the doped silicon amorphous layers  n on the front and p on the back  The i  p  and n layers were deposited in a PECVD cluster ( Indeotec Octopus 2 ) with a thickness of 8  7  15 nm respectively  The back contact of the SHJ was realized by sputtering sequentially ITO and Ag ( 150 and 250 nm  respectively ) in the PVD part of the Octopus 2 cluster  After the In2O3 : H top contact deposition  metal fingers are screen printed using a commercial silver paste and immediately annealed at 200 °C for 15 min in ambient air  Deposition of the IZRO films IZRO films ( 100 nm ) were deposited by radio-frequency sputtering technique on pre-cleaned quartz substrates using Angstrom Engineering EvoVac sputtering tool  The deposited films were annealed in ambient air at 200 °C for 25 min  The resultant films had sheet resistivity of 25 Ω sq−1  The details of the deposition parameters have been reported in the previous study45  Device characterization The JV curves under a simulated AM15 solar spectrum were acquired in an N2 purging atmosphere with 0049 cm2 aperture mask  Large area devices have active area of 195 cm2  and 049 cm2  1 cm2 and 168 cm2 masks were used for accurate JV measurements  The scanning rate is 100 mV s−1  The input power density was adjusted to 1 sun using a NIST-traceable calibrated reference cell ( Newport 91 150 V )  The lamp spectrum was measured using irradiance-calibrated spectrometers  For EQE calibration  two photodetectors  Newport 818-UV and Newport 838-IR were used  The current response was collected at short circuit conditions with a Lakeshore preamplifier connected to a Stanford Research 830 lock-in amplifier  The stabilized power output was obtained by setting the bias voltage to the initial VMPP that was determined from the JV curve  During the perovskite/CQD 4T measurement  the CQD device was masked by 0049 cm2 and placed behind the actual working perovskite device with an active area of 0053 cm2  JV measurements of the 4T perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells have been performed using Wavelabs Sinus 220 LED-based solar simulator with AM 15 G irradiance spectrum at a controlled temperature of 25 °C  The silicon cell device area was covered by a larger ( 2 cm × 2 cm ) semitransparent perovskite cell filters  fabricated in the same batch and procedure as that of the actual devices  The illumination area of the devices was determined by a laser-cut aperture with 232 cm2 area  EQE measurements have been performed using PV-Tools LOANA without any light and voltage biasing  The beam size was 15 by 15 mm during the EQE measurements  which means the measured data includes SHJ metal fingers as well  Perovskite/CQD 4T characterizations have been performed in N2 purging environment while perovskite/silicon 4T were measured in ambient air with around 50 % RH and without any encapsulation  Materials characterization The absorbance was characterized via UV–Vis–IR spectrophotometer ( Lambda 950 )  The cross-section images of devices were obtained by Hitachi SU5000 microscope  Photoelectron spectroscopy was carried out in a PHI5500 Multi-Technique system with non-monochromatized He-Iα radiation ( UPS ) ( hν = 2122 eV )  All samples were prepared on ITO substrate  Steady-state PL and time-resolved PL were measured using a Horiba Fluorolog time-correlated single-photon-counting system with photomultiplier tube detectors  The light was illuminated from the top surface of the perovskite film  For steady-state PL measurements  the excitation source is a monochromated Xe lamp ( peak wavelength at 540 nm with a line width of 2 nm )  For time-resolved PL  we used a green laser diode ( λ = 540 nm ) for the excitation source with an excitation power density of 5 mW cm−2  The PL decay curves were fitted with biexponential components to obtain a fast and slow decay lifetime  The mean carrier lifetimes τ for the biexponential fit was calculated by the weighted average method  Transient photovoltage decays were measured on a home-made system  For the transient photovoltage decay measurements  a red-light emitting diode was used to modulate the Voc with a constant light bias  The pulse duration is set to 1 µs and the repetition rate to 500 Hz  For the constant light bias  a continuous light source from a Xe lamp was coupled through a fiber to collimate on the active area of the solar cell under study  The intensity of the pulsed laser was set in a way that the modulated Voc was 50 mV to ensure a perturbation regime  The open-circuit voltage transient  induced by the light perturbation was measured with a digital oscilloscope set to an input impedance of 1 MΩ  The charge recombination lifetime was fitted by a single exponential decay  Optical modeling All refractive indexes were obtained by variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry and homemade MATLAB

are currently explored as active materials in light-emitting diodes ( LEDs ) with very promising outcomes12  Some of the optoelectronic properties of perovskites are ideal for efficient LEDs  particularly the color-tunable emission  the easy manufacturing134  and the reduced formation of active electronic trap states56  However  some of the peculiar characteristics of three-dimensional hybrid halide perovskites such as loosely bound excitons and very high carrier mobilities  instead  hinder electroluminescence  At room temperature  excitons in hybrid halide perovskites have indeed low binding energies78  therefore PLQY increases at high excitation flux when radiative bimolecular recombination dominates  In the actual PeLEDs  radiative recombination competes with trap-mediated non-radiative decay and Auger recombination mechanisms  the latter being the principal factors responsible of the device efficiency roll-off at high current density regimes56910  In general  the term “ efficiency roll off ” is used to describe the decreasing of the efficiency of the device at high current density regimes  It can be quantified by the critical current density  which represents the current density at which the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) drops to half of its maximum value11  In perovskite LEDs  the origin of this phenomenon is still controversial  but it has been recently attributed to either non-radiative processes that reduce the luminescence efficiency or to excessive population of charge carriers passing through the device without forming electron-hole pairs12  Spatial confinement of injected carries has been proven to enhance radiative recombination at low excitation levels  then improve the performance of Pe-LEDs16131415  The simplest approach to promote the spatial confinement of the injected charges devises the growth of ultra-thin perovskite active layer ( ~20 nm )  which however easily leads to inhomogeneous substrate coverage causing current leakages and shorts1416  Alternatively  the confinement effect has been achieved by using low-dimensional perovskite nanocrystals or by growing multiple quantum wells mixing 2D/3D perovskites1131415171819  At high current densities  however  the increased spatial confinement tends to increase Auger recombination rates  so that strategies that boost emission of PeLEDs at low current densities end up in causing an efficiency roll-off at high currents12  Preventing this phenomenon is of paramount importance and presently only few work have tried to address it  among those the most successful strategy resulted to be the tuning of the quantum well width  in 2D/3D  leading to a reduction in the local carrier density12  In this work  we report a simple method to engineer the phase composition and to finely tune the grain sizes of perovskite with the precise scope of sustaining high radiance at elevated current density regimes  thus restraining the roll-off effect  This was achieved by using starch biopolymer as templating agent for the growth of formamidinium lead iodide ( NH2CH2NH3PbI3 or FAPbI3 ) 3D perovskite grains2021  Starch is organized into linear or branched structures defined amylose and amylopectin  respectively  composed by repeating a-D-glucopyranosyl units ( Fig S1 ) 2223  Thanks to the presence of –OH groups through the molecular chains2021  starch interacts with perovskite components in the precursor solution and guides the formation of uniform polycrystalline perovskite films with perfect surface coverage and well-interconnected small grains with size down to 100 nm  Near-infrared LEDs  exploiting the peculiar prerogatives of perovskite FAPbI3/starch active layer  was successfully developed reaching an impressive radiance value of 2067 W/sr * m2 obtained at very high currents density of ~1000 mA/cm2  a value never yet reported for IR emitting PeLEDs12  Perovskite micro and nano-structural changes and their influence on optoelectronic properties were studied as a function of starch content by means of an in-depth photophysical characterization confirming that the device performances are strongly related to the perovskite film structure and to the presence of the insulating polymer  Though X-ray diffraction we found that starch leads to the formation of mixed domains of α ( emissive ) and δ ( non-emissive ) FAPbI3 phases  a crystalline scenario that have been proven to reduce the local dielectric landscape and the material average grain size  thus increasing the exciton binding energy and the spatially confinement of the excitons24  eventually leading to PLQY enhancement and to blue shift of the emission peak upon starch addition with respect to the reference  The presence of an insulating polymer  in addition  improves light extraction by reducing the refractive index or even enhancing the effective optical absorption by screening the charge at the polymer-perovskite interfaces  Finally  the better coverage of the substrate obtained with polymer improves the active interfaces leading to high current densities  Results Among the organic cations used as perovskite precursors  we have selected formamidinium ( FAI ) that forms a highly symmetrical perovskite structure with a band gap of 148 eV2526  To promoted the formation of stabilized emissive α phase ( from δ phase ) at low annealing temperature  together with much enhanced NIR emission24 and resistance to humidity we introduce here an excess amount of FAI in the perovskite precursors ( FAI : PbI2 = 2:1 )  FAPbI3 films were obtained by a single spin coating step of perovskite formulations with different starch biopolymer content onto polyethylenimine ethoxylated ( PEIE ) modified ZnO substrates  Film morphology was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and depicted in Figs 1 ( b ) and S2  Partial and patchy film coverage  characterized by isolated and large grains ( > 1 µm ) with irregular shapes were observed in the case of pristine FAPbI3 perovskite ( Fig  1 ( b ) )  resulting  as expected for this one-step unmodified process  in a large amount of the substrate remained uncovered  This inhomogeneous surface morphology and formation of pinholes in perovskite films would result in the formation of a bad interface with the transport layers and electrical shunt paths when integrated in the actual PeLEDs  Advantageously  by adding starch with increasing amount  perfect surface coverage was obtained and the perovskite morphology was enhanced reaching well-interconnected small grains with sizes down to 100 nm  as showed in Fig  1 ( b )  The improved surface coverage morphology is expected to enhance the charge injection and balance  reducing leakage currents in the resulting PeLEDs27  Figure 1 figure 1 A cartoon representing the influence of the starch molecules on the perovskite film morphology and structure upon starch addition ( a )  SEM images of perovskite films

identified diffraction peaks corresponding to the α and δ phases of FAPbI3 perovskite and ITO substrate  respectively ( c )  Full size image Remarkably  the physical/chemical interaction between starch ( Fig  S1 ) and perovskite precursors allowed the deposition of a smooth and homogeneous FAPbI3 film in a simple single step deposition20  The hydrogen chemical interaction with the –OH groups of the starch macromolecule20 can indeed interfere with the self-aggregation properties and the complex dynamic equilibria existing in solution between the perovskite precursors  profoundly affecting the morphology of the resulting polycrystalline film  Accordingly  we found that the size of the perovskite grains is strictly related to the concentration of starch  with the crystal size decreasing by increasing the starch content  as shown in Fig  1 ( a )  The crystalline structure of pristine perovskite and with the addition of starch at different concentrations was examined by X-ray diffraction ( XRD )  as reported in Fig  1 ( c )  The XRD pattern of the pristine FAPbI3 film ( red curve )  showed a diffraction peak at 2θ = 139° ( −110 ) and less intense diffraction peaks at 2θ = 281° ( 220 ) and 2θ = 315° ( 222 )  which corresponds to FAPbI3 α-phase2428  confirming that the excess FAI contributed to the formation of α-FAPbI3 at mild annealing temperature ( 100 °C )  The presence of 5 % and 10 % of starch into FAPbI3 leads to reduced intensity and broadening of the XRD peaks associated to the α-phase perovskite ( inset Fig  1 ( c ) green and orange spectra )  suggesting that the presence of biopolymer resulted in decreased crystal sizes19  In presence of starch  another peak appeared at 2θ = 118° ( 010 )  corresponding to δ-phase of FAPbI32426  In general  the variation of FAI precursors concentration affects the equilibrium between α and δ FAPbI3 phases  stabilizing one or the other  by acting on the colloid particle size and thus on the total free energy ( including surface and bulk ) of the two phases24  We found that the introduction of biopolymer led to the formation of a α-δ FAPbI3 mixed phase and the intensity of δ-phase peak was enhanced by increasing starch concentration  eventually resulting in well-defined δ-phase peaks at 2θ = 118° and 2θ = 261° and an almost total disappearance of the α-phase peak  It is worth to underline that  because the thicknesses of the active perovskite films are very low  especially for the 5 % and 10 % being ~60 nm and ~80 nm thick respectively  the XRD signals are weak and the contribution of the substrate is remarkable  In Figure S3 we report the pristine starch as reference  showing no evidence of crystalline phases  Thus  the inclusion of biopolymer led to a more complex crystalline final structure comprising mixed domains of α and δ FAPbI3 phases organized in grains with a reduced size homogeneously distributed on the substrate202129  From FT-IR analysis ( Fig  S4 ) of starch and perovskite/starch composites  we noticed a shift of the characteristic band of OH of starch that can be safely attributed to the hydrogen interaction between starch and perovskite precursors2030  The starch in addition gelatinized in DMSO solvent creating a matrix  containing a large number of –OH groups  in which the perovskite grains are embedded during crystallization  a situation that affects the grain size  Differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) measurements ( Fig  S5 ) showed that starch modify the crystallization enthalpy of FAPbI3 perovskite  being 811 J/g for pristine perovskite and 589 J/g with the addition 5 % of starch  likely due the establishment of hydrogen bonding between starch and FA ( see FT-IR ) already in the precursor solution29  This can promotes the formation of an increasing amount of δ-phase in FAPbI3  by incremental addition of starch  The combined effect of the phase mixing  along with the physical confinement of such crystallite into a polymer matrix  had a dramatic effect on the performances of PeLEDs based on these composites  The FAPbI3 films were integrated into devices consisting of multilayer stack  as schematically depicted in the inset of Fig  2 ( a )  The PEIE modified ZnO film was the electron transporting layer while the poly ( 99-dioctyl-fluorene-co-N- ( 4-butylphenyl ) diphenylamine ) ( TFB ) was used as hole transporting layer13  The normalized electroluminescence ( EL ) spectra of the devices ( recorded at maximum EQE voltages ) are reported in Fig  2 ( a )  The EL emission peak at the NIR  801 nm  characteristic of 3D-FAPbI3 perovskites13  blue shifted by about 14 nm  18 nm and 50 nm after adding 5 %  10 % and 15 % of starch respectively  This blueshift is a first clear indication of the perturbation caused by the starch mixture to the optical properties of the perovskite films  Such a blue shift can be correlated to the α/δ phase junction  causing a change in the dielectric constant of the media surrounding the emitting crystals  In our case  the biopolymer  thanks to its insulating nature  also contributes to dielectric landscape modification  The shape of EL spectra was not altered by the starch addition nor by different bias voltages applied up to reached max EQE  Only at high voltages the emission peak blueshifted by 6 nm  5 nm and 4 nm in presence of 0 %  5 % and 10 % of starch respectively  while it stayed unaltered at the higher starch concentration ( 15 % )  as reported in Fig  S6  This observation suggests that increased starch concentration offers some protection to the perovskite active layer against detrimental effects related to high current densities  Figure 2 figure 2 Normalized electroluminescence ( EL ) spectra of the devices with 0 % ( red )  5 % ( green )  10 % ( orange ) and 15 % ( blue ) of starch  recorded at maximum EQE voltages  the inset is the device architecture ( a ) ; Radiance ( line ) and EQE ( line + simbols ) vs Current density curves of the best device

PeLEDs reported in literature ( the numbers correspond to the references ) ( d ) 134121314313233343536373839  Full size image The maximum EQEs and radiance of LED devices as a function of starch concentration  obtained by taking the maximum value for each LED devices and by calculating the standard deviation for each formulation  are reported in Fig  2 ( c )  The device without starch ( named : F10 ) achieved a remarkable best EQE value of 77 % at 24 V with a current density of 1229 mA cm−2 and a radiance of 86 W m−2 sr−1  Noticeably the LED device containing 5 % of starch reported in Fig  2 ( b )  showed a maximum EQE value of 48 % at 28 V with a current density of 639 mA cm−2  but it reached an outstanding high radiance of around 206 W m−2 sr−1 at 4 V and at very high current density of 1020 mA cm−2  In panel b of Fig  2  it is very clear the different behaviour between the referential F10 based device and the starch containing one  The reference gave overall better results in terms of EQE at low current regimes  while at higher currents a roll-off effect is evidently linked to a decrease of the performances ( panel b )  meanwhile the starch containing device showed an almost constant EQE ( around 48 % ) up to 1000 mA cm−2  highlighting an excellent tolerance to high carrier densities regimes and a reduced efficiency roll off if compared to previous reports12  This is a very important result  as for most LEDs  the efficiencies diminished abruptly at high current densities  here  the presence of the starch allows keeping high-efficiency operation even at very high current levels  In addition  a very low turn-on voltage of 14 V was observed for the best device ( starch 5 % )  even lower than the emission photon energy of 16 eV  suggesting thereby efficient and barrier-free charge injection into the perovskite emitter  as consequence of the improved interfaces  This  combined with the rapid increase of both current density and radiance  by orders of magnitude after turn-on  demonstrated a very low series resistance and efficient operations of the PeLED device13 as a clear evidence of the existence of a very good carrier percolation path through perovskite-interconnected domains among the insulating starch matrix and δ phase  The very high radiance would also depend from these considerations  as an easy injection and a smoother homogeneous film would allow reaching higher current withstanding no leakages nor shorts6  The absence of perturbation in the EL spectra ( absence of blueshift in the sample containing 15 % of starch )  under incremental applied voltages  is attributed to an effective screening of the emitting crystals in relation to the electric field increase  Noticeably  the performances  in terms of radiances  currents and EQE  are among the highest reported in literature for PeLED device operating at near-infrared wavelengths  as showed in Figs 2 ( d ) and S7134121314313233343536373839  The effect of starch continued to raise perovskite performance up to a concentration of 10 %  which achieved a high EQE of 55 % at 28 V and a best radiance value of 170 W m−2 sr−1 at 4 V and 936 mA cm−2 of current density  However  the LED device containing 15 % of starch showed a drastic reduction of performances down to 15 % of EQE achieved at 2 V with a current density of 65 mA cm−2 and a radiance of 14 W m−2 sr−1 at 32 V and 33 mA cm−2  The highest starch concentration ( 15 % ) still brings the positive crystals size reduction and an improved coverage of the substrates  as seen in SEM analysis ( Fig  1 ( a ) )  however the insulating properties of the starch together with the formation of a higher concentration δ-phase  finally determined a high resistance to injected charges transport  as demonstrated by very low current density achieved if compared to the other devices  Aiming at a further rationalize the starch influence on the material and device performances  we investigated the optical properties of the films  In perovskite materials  a range of different charge-carrier recombination mechanisms occur  which depend on the charge-carrier density ( n ) to a different degree  The rate of change in n can be expressed through the following equation ( 1 ) : ( 1 ) where k1 is the monomolecular recombination rate constant ( which is typically related to charge trapping )  k2 is the bimolecular ( electron–hole ) recombination rate constant  and k3 is the third-order Auger rate constant  In the case of free carriers and a bulk perovskite  only the bimolecular recombination is associated to emission of a photon  therefore for light-emitting applications it is of paramount importance to reduce the impact of the trap mediated and of the Auger deactivation processes  Spatial confinement increases the local carrier density and therefore radiative recombination ; in the extreme case of quantum confinement  when the dimensions of the perovskite grains decrease below the Bohr radius associated with electrons and holes  typically 10 nm  electrons and holes do not move independently anymore and the radiative recombination rate becomes monomolecular  typically improving emission efficiency at low carrier densities  Photoluminescence ( PL ) measurements provided useful information to understand the effect of starch addition on radiative recombination processes  The steady-state PL measurements were carried out on FAPbI3 films  as a function of starch content ; the spectra are showed in Fig  3a  The PL emission peak of pristine FAPbI3 is located at 813 nm  in line with what reported for α-phase of this material24  The emission peak blue shifted by around 15 nm  30 nm and 37 nm by adding 5 %  10 % and 15 % of starch  respectively  This observation confirmed the EL results and further underlined an effect related to the biopolymer interaction with perovskite formation  The emission quantum yield measures the efficiency of radiative recombination with respect to competing processes and  since in perovskite radiative recombination is bimolecular  its value tends to increase with carrier density  Figure 3b shows the PLQY of the perovskite films under continuous wavelength ( cw ) excitation with a green laser ( 532 nm in wavelength ) of variable intensity  The addition of starch improved the emission efficiency with respect to the reference  pure perovskite sample  both at low excitation density  where the largest starch concentrations led to better performance  and at high excitation  where 5 % starch concentration produced the best quantum yield  The temporal decay of photoluminescence under femtosecond pulsed excitation was measured with a streak camera in all samples  as shown in Fig  3c  The addition of starch reduced the photoluminescence lifetime at low excitation densities  meaning that it enhanced trap-assisted recombination and its corresponding k1 coefficient  which should have reduced  not enhanced  the emitted PL intensity  The analysis of the PL lifetimes ( Fig  3d ) showed that decay times decreased linearly with the pulse fluence ( dotted line )  as predicted for bimolecular recombination ; at the highest fluences decay times were very close to the temporal resolution of the streak camera apparatus  Figure 3 figure 3 ( a ) PL spectra under low-intensity cw excitation ( less than 1 mW/cm2 )

linear dependence  ( e ) Instantaneous photoluminescence intensity PL0 measured as a function of laser pulses fluence and presented in log-log scale ; the dotted line shows a quadratic dependence  Full size image To rationalize how  in the starch-perovskite composites  the improvement in cw PLQY coexisted with the increase in non-radiative recombination rate  we measured the instantaneous PL intensity  PL0  emitted in coincidence with the excitation laser pulse ( Fig  3e )  Such quantity  in the backscattering geometry  can be written as where is the solid angle of photoluminescence collection  the hybrid perovskite refractive index  the absorption coefficient  the optical emission and excitation frequencies  the sample reflectivity and the photocarrier concentration injected by each laser pulse of fluence 4041  The main take-away from Fig  3e is that PL0 was higher in samples with starch than without  meaning that the biopolymer either enhanced the radiative recombination coefficient k2 or improved light extraction by reducing the refractive index  or even enhanced the effective optical absorption because of dielectric scattering at the polymer-perovskite interfaces  In addition  the α/δ phase junction would also contribute to these phenomena  Importantly  the presence of starch did not alter the order of recombination dynamics  since for all samples the intensity of PL0 grew as the square of the pulse fluence ( dotted line in Fig  3e )  which is the signature of emission by bimolecular recombination  At the highest available fluences  Auger recombination caused a saturation of PL0 at comparable values for all samples  an indication that the Auger coefficient k3 was not significantly affected by the presence of the biopolymer  Combining morphological  structural and photophysical characterization  the overall picture that emerged is that the efficiency roll off is reduced and radiance is enhanced with starch thanks to a combiation of factors : i ) the formation of α/δ mixed phase  assisted by starch  which could improve the carrier recombination in the perovskite layer avoiding losses at the interface with the hole/electron transporting layers42 ; i ) improved substrate coverage of the perovskite film  which hinders current leakage ; iii ) modification of dielectric landscape at the starch-perovskite and at the α-δ interfaces  eventually enhancing the electron-hole radiative recombination or light out diffusion  Conclusion In summary  by growing FAPbI3 perovskite crystals into a biopolymeric matrix we achieved control on the grain sizes and on the peculiar crystalline composition  A mixed α/δ phase junction  characterized by enhanced NIR emission  reduced grains size and α phase stabilization ( from δ phase ) at low annealing temperature  was in fact formed into the starch network  The use of starch controls the perovskite grain size  their electronic screening at high-carrier densities as well as the substrate coverage  ensuring high performing PeLEDs  The composites embedded in LED lead to maximum radiances above 200 Wm−2 sr−1 and very high efficiencies ~5 % EQE obtained at high current densitiy regimes

detailed balance calculations and numerical simulations of PIN based Perovskite solar cell at different illumination intensity  We find that the extracted values of rate coefficients are in accordance with the assumed input parameters  Our methodology can also be applicable to other thin film carrier selective PIN devices  Access provided by Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology Download conference paper PDF 1 Introduction With the impressive gain in efficiency  organic-inorganic Perovskite materials have attracted a lot of research focus in photovoltaics community [ 1 ]  Characterization of such materials  in terms of recombination rate  is of prime interest for device performance optimization  In literature  photoluminescence and transmittance measurements on perovskite have been typically used to obtain rate constants such as SRH carrier life time τ  radiative coefficient and Auger coefficient [ 2 ]  Here  we explore the possibility of extracting such rate constants from illumination intensity ( S ) or generation rate ( G ) dependent open circuit voltage ( ) of Perovskite Solar Cell ( PSC )  For this  we perform ( 1 ) detailed balance calculations ( DBCs ) and ( 2 ) detailed numerical simulations ( DNS ) of carrier selective PIN based PSC to obtain at different Illumination intensities ( 0001–1000 Sun )  2 Results and Discussions For DBC  we use detailed balance theorem which states that the generation rate is equal to recombination rate at and  for intrinsic material  is given as :  Here is the excess minority carrier concentration  By definition  is calculated by using :  where  is the thermal voltage and is the intrinsic carrier concentration  Here we consider two cases of rate constants : μ ( good quality film ) and ( b ) μ ( comparatively bad quality film )  Depending on the illumination intensity  is limited by either or and proportional to or  respectively  Approximate values of rate constants can thus be obtained from respective illumination intensity window  We find that the quality of film and relative magnitude of rate constants determine the illumination intensity window  The breadth of illumination intensity window ( shown in Fig  671a  b ) plays a significant role in determining good estimate for a particular rate constant  For example  the probability of extraction is more for case ( a ) as compared to case ( b ) at the high range of illumination intensity  Fig  671 figure 1 a  b Variation of with illumination intensity for different values of rate constants  Rate constant values are associated with each dotted line with respective color  Dotted and solid line represents contribution from individual component ( blue-trap assisted  red-radiative and blue color-auger term ) and net recombination rate  respectively Full size image For DNS  we consider perovskite ( with band gap and thickness ) as the intrinsic active layer ( AL ) and is sandwiched between heavily doped hole and electron transport layers ( HTL and ETL )  Energy level alignment of different layers ( see inset of Fig  672a ) suggest that the dark current is limited by recombination of injected charge carriers inside AL  Charge carriers recombination inside AL is modeled by SRH ( characterized by )  Radiative ( ) and Auger ( ) processes  Further  we consider uniform generation rate of charge carriers across active layer thickness  Modeled device is then discretized into 2-D and self-consistent solution of Poisson ’ s  drift-diffusion and continuity equations is achieved at each node to obtain lighted current voltage ( IV ) characteristics  Fig  672 figure 2 a  b Piecewise fit of calculated ( black solid line ) on simulated ( symbols ) values of for two different cases ie  a good quality film with large auger recombination and b comparatively bad quality film with small auger recombination rate  Inset of ( a ) shows the energy level alignment of different layers used to model PIN based Perovskite solar cell  We find that the extraction of in the specified range of illumination intensities is not possible for low auger recombination as the is limited by or B Full size image We extract from illuminated IV characteristics at different illumination intensities and obtain rate constants by doing piecewise fit of DBC in respective illumination window ( as shown in Fig  672 )  We find that the back extracted values of and  obtained from the low and medium range of illumination intensity  matches well with the assumed input parameters  Approximate values of can be obtained from illumination window at high intensities for large auger recombination  However  the extraction of for low auger recombination can be non-trivial because it may require large illumination intensity—a

AgBiI4 Rudorffite solar cell with HCl as an additive Article 16 February 2024 Introduction Nowadays  organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) with fascinating optoelectronic properties have attracted remarkable attention in photovoltaic devices12  However  their instability under ambient conditions is one of the major limitations of practical implementation3  The second barrier in the commercialization of PSCs is the use of expensive materials as hole transport layer ( HTL ) 4  The highest efficiency PSCs are developed based on mesoporous configuration  where used organic molecule 22′77′-Tetrakis [ N  N-di ( 4-methoxyphenyl ) amino ] -99′-spirobifluorene ( spiro-OMeTAD ) with dopants of lithium bis ( trifluoromethane ) sulfonyl ) imide ( Li-TFSI ) and 4-tert-butylpyridine ( TBP ) as HTL  These materials not only destroy the device stability but also increase device cost5  Therefore  many studies have tried to find appropriate hole transport materials ( HTMs ) of improved stability and low cost678  CuSCN is one of the most promising inorganic HTMs9  CuSCN has a higher maximum hole mobility ( 001–01 cm2 V−1 s−1 )  which is far larger than of spiro-OMeTAD ( 6 × 10–5 cm2 V−1 s−1 )  Also  it has suitable energy levels as well as simplified synthesis routes as compared to spiro-OMeTAD10  Because of the streamlined and affordable procedures used to fabricate CuSCN HTMs  PSCs employing CuSCN HTMs instead of spiro-OMeTAD have a great opportunity for commercialization11  Despite the usefulness of CuSCN as HTL  there are two major problems with applying it  First  it has been reported that most solvents used for CuSCN deposition dissolve the perovskite materials12  Secondly  the perovskite layer has not been completely covered with the inorganic CuSCN film  The coated CuSCN is crystallized in a texture grain structure  So  the CuSCN HTL and perovskite interactions are insufficient13  Therefore  it is desirable to improve both the PCE and stability of PSCs from the viewpoint of interface engineering  Mhaisalkar et al14 have reported the formation of a 2D alkylammonium halide perovskite layer on the 3D film to passivate interfacial defects and vacancies  Also  an ultra-stable perovskite device has been introduced by engineering the ( HOOC ( CH2 ) 4NH3 ) 2PbI4 interface between MAPbI3 and spiro-OMeTAD with 146 % PCE15  Bai et al16 designed the 2D perovskite interface layer by in-situ growth of PEA2PbI4 on top of the 3D perovskite  This 2D passivating layer can induce larger Fermi-level splitting in the 2D-3D perovskite film under light illumination  leading to an improved VOC and thus  an enhanced PCE16  In addition to ammonium salts with long-chain alkyl groups  different types of amines have also been used to form 2D perovskite interface layers on 3D perovskites  For example  benzylamine solution in chlorobenzene was poured on top of the 3D FAPbI3 lattice  leading to the 2D perovskite formation on FAPbI3  The modified device exhibited a champion efficiency of 192 % and VOC of 112 V and showed good stability in 50 ± 5 RH % 17  By introducing these phenyl-groups or alkyl chains  the 2D networks are created  including inorganic perovskite layers of corner-sharing [ PbX6 ] 4− octahedra restricted between interdigitating two ammonium cation layers  These two layers are combined by π–π or Van Der-Waals interactions between two alkyl or phenyl groups  which were belonging to a relatively week bonding  So  space between two [ PbX6 ] 4− octahedra would be expanded due to the repulsive force1819  As an alternative to these alkyl or phenyl groups  a suitable method is to use hydrophobic molecules like 5-Ammonium Valeric Acid ( 5-AVA ) on the surface of perovskite grains via ionic and hydrogen bonds2021  2D perovskite used dialkylammonium cations as the bulky spacer has been synthesized by Lin and co-workers for the first time19  The two BA layers between the inorganic sheets of [ PbI6 ] 4− octahedra have been replaced by a monolayer of DA cations  So  the replacement of van der Waals interactions to covalent -H2C-CH2- bond can be considered19  Up to now  no studies have been reported on the use of p-phenyl-diammonium ( PDA ) groups as the bulky cations for constructing the 2D interface layer ( ( PDA ) PbI4 ) between 3D perovskite and CuSCN layers  By using PDA groups  the inorganic sheets of [ PbI6 ] 4− octahedral are held together by one molecule  meaning by ionic interactions  Therefore  the perovskite stability is increased as PbI2 is held firmly within the perovskite film  and the layered perovskite will be organized better2223  We chose this barrier molecule due to ( i ) the diammonium functional group  which should provide a more organized structure ; ( ii ) the relatively short length of the molecule  which will decrease the distance between the inorganic framework ; ( iii ) the aromatic ring  which should have free π-electrons ; therefore  it can enhance the charge transport and protect the surface of the perovskite by shielding it against reaction with atmospheric oxygen and water molecules24  Most strikingly  this ultra-thin 2D passivation layer by the use of PDA cations as a bulky spacer not only can passivate the defects of the perovskite surface but also induce self-healing properties in PSCs  The PSCs can return to its original phase and performance after exposure to water vapor and dried in ambient air  respectively  Results and discussion Different concentrations of PDAI solutions ( 3–15 mg mL−1 ) was used to the in-situ growth of 2D perovskite at ( FAPbI3 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015 and CuSCN interface  The preparation scheme and the device configuration are illustrated in Fig  1  The cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) image is shown in Fig  1c  In a 2D perovskite used one ammonium functional group as the long-chain organic cations  two ammonium can interact with each other by van der Waals force  So  space between two [ PbX6 ] 4− octahedra would be expanded due to the repulsive force18  When a cation with two ammonium functional groups is used to prepare 2D perovskite  the inorganic frameworks are stack together by the stronger ionic bonds  as illustrated in Supplementary Fig  S119  So  it is anticipated that the 2D perovskite will be formed as an ultra-thin layer  as shown in Fig  1c 25  The SEM images of the perovskite films passivated by different concentrations of PDAI are illustrated in Fig  1d and Supplementary Fig  S2  For the perovskite film without PDAI post-treatment  there are two separated phases ( Fig  1d )  The dark grain region is perovskite crystal  and the bright grain phase is PbI226  After post-treatment of perovskite film with 5 mg mL−1 of PDAI  the PbI2 layer has been fully covered ( Fig  1d ) 27  The surface of perovskite film passivated by PDAI is remarkably more compact compared with pristine film  When the solution concentration of PDAI reaches to 5 mg mL−1  there emerges a new layer that partly covered the ( FAPbI3 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015 film  which is speculated to be a 2D perovskite capping layer growth in the surface or interface of ( FAPbI3 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015 grain boundaries via reaction of PDAI and excessive PbI228  Surprisingly  the ( FAPbI3 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015 film post-treated with 7 mg mL−1 of PDAI  changed into compact perovskite film with grains larger than 1 μm PDAI solution treatment ( Supplementary Fig  S2b )  So  PDAI solution can induce the pristine film second-growth into large grains with fewer grain boundary defects based on Ostwald ripening mechanism29  The use of higher PDAI concentrations adversely affects the perovskite morphology and the excessive PDAI is trapped in the GBs  which may be decomposed under illumination and also caused phase separation ( Supplementary Fig  S2c  d ) 30  Figure 1 figure 1 ( a ) Method to prepare perovskite solar cells with interface engineering  ( b ) Schematic device architecture used in the present work  ( c ) Cross-sectional SEM image of the complete device with interface engineering  ( d ) Low and high magnification of plane-view SEM images of perovskite films post-treated with 0 mg mL−1 and ( e ) 5 mg mL−1 of PDAI  Samples for SEM were prepared by deposition of perovskite films on mp-TiO2/bl-TiO2/FTO/glass  Full size image The XRD patterns are utilized to investigate the effect of PDAI additive and 2D perovskite formation on the crystallinity of ( FAPbI3 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015 films ( Fig  2a )  The XRD patterns show ( FAPbI3 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015 crystal peaks containing three peaks at 142°  284°  and 319°  related to ( 110 )  ( 220 ) and ( 310 ) crystal face  respectively30  Characteristic diffraction peak at 127° corresponding to PbI2 is observed in ( FAPbI3 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015 film due to the excess value of PbI2 in precursor composition31  Compared to pristine film  the intensity of the PbI2 peak is declined by the 3 mg mL−1 of PDAI  and a new peak at 51° is related to the 2D perovskite ( PDA ) PbI4  It means that the excess value of PbI2 in the pristine film is completely reacted with 3 mg mL−1 of PDAI and created 2D and quasi-2D perovskite  The XRD patterns of 2D perovskite film and PDAI powder are also shown in Supplementary Fig  S3  Furthermore  the characteristic peaks of ( 110 )  ( 220 )  ( 310 ) for perovskite films are notably enhanced by the addition of 5 mg mL−1 PDAI  The FWHM values of the characteristic ( 110 ) peak are presented in Supplementary Fig  S4  The smallest FWHM value belongs to the perovskite film passivated by 5 mg mL−1 PDAI  showing its excellent crystallization with a preferred orientation of ( 110 ) 30  However  a new peak appeared at 39° in the presence of the higher concentration of PDAI is related to the diffraction pattern of PDAI powder  Figure 2 figure 2 ( a ) XRD patterns and ( b ) UV–Vis absorption spectra of perovskite film post-treated with different concentrations of PDAI deposited on FTO/glass substrate  ( c ) Steady-state PL of perovskite films post-treated with different concentrations of PDAI with or without TiO2 and CuSCN layer  Full size image Figure 2b indicates the normalized UV–Vis absorption spectra of perovskite films  A little improved absorbance is obtained for ( FAPbI3 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015/ ( PDA ) PbI4 films prepared in the presence of PDAI near the bandgap absorption region  As the PDAI content is increased up to 5 mg mL−1  the perovskite film absorption is increased that is related to the PDAI addition impact on the preferred orientation crystal structure and uniform surface morphology32  When the PDAI addition amount is increased up to 15 mg mL−1  the absorbance is sharply decreased  which can relate to the crystallinity decrease  according to the SEM and XRD results  The bandgap of perovskite films can be deduced from the Tauc plot ( Supplementary Fig  S5 )  The bandgap is calculated 155 eV for control pristine film and 154 eV for ( FAPbI3 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015/ ( PDA ) PbI4 films prepared in the presence of 3–10 mg mL−1 PDAI  For ( FAPbI3 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015/ ( PDA ) PbI4 film passivated by 15 mg mL−1  the bandgap is increased to 156 eV  The photoluminescence ( PL ) spectra of the perovskite layer are shown in Fig  2c  which shows a peak at 780 nm with the FWHM of about 50 nm30  The perovskite films passivated by 3  5 and 7 mg mL−1 of PDAI indicate an enhanced PL yield in the comparison to the reference film  indicating less involvement in carrier recombination  On the other hand  the ( FAPbI3 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015 film post-treated with 5 mg mL−1 PDAI presents a higher fluorescence peak in comparison to the control film  suggesting the uniform  pinhole-free  reduced density of GBs and compact structure of perovskite resulted in low density of charge-trapping and recombination sites as illustrated in the SEM results3334  It is reported that the charge recombination is minimized in the presence of ammonium cations which have benzene ring in their structure  It is due to prolonging the electron recombination because of the carrier accumulation in the benzene ring35  In the presence of 10 and 15 mg mL−1 PDAI  the large density of unreacted PDAI and relatively lose GBs leads to light scattering and excessive charge-trapping site creation3637  Besides  the PL peak intensity of glass/perovskite/CuSCN samples is significantly decreased in the comparison of glass/perovskite ones  which can be related to the suitable valence band position of the HTMs over perovskite layer  In other words  the extra reduction in the PL spectrum is observed for glass/perovskite/CuSCN samples  where the 2D perovskite is inserted by in-situ growth as an interface  It is because of the better CuSCN coverage on 2D perovskite and interface engineering  In this study  twelve kinds of devices ( A1 to F1 and A2 to F2 ) were manufacture and studied systematically  Devices are defined as follows  Device A : ( FAPbI3 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015 was used as an absorbent layer without in-situ growth of 2D perovskite on top of it  Device B to F : ( FAPbI3 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015 layer post-treated with different concentrations of PDAI ( 3  5  7  10 and 15 mg mL−1 ) using spin-coating and in-situ growth of ( PDA ) PbI4 on top of the 3D perovskite layer  Devices A1 to F1 were fabricated by the spin-coating of CuSCN on top of the perovskite layer as HTL and devices A2 to F2 were fabricated without CuSCN HTL  Figure 3e shows the photocurrent density–voltage of the devices  All of the steps related to the preparation of solution precursor and spin-coating of the perovskite layer were performed at ambient conditions  The results indicate that JSC and VOC are increased by spin-coating of 3 mg mL−1 PDAI on the ( FAPbI3 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015 layer ( Fig  3a  b )  The higher values of JSC and VOC for device B1 in the comparison of A1 are related to the low density of GBs  large grain size  and the pinhole-free surface of the absorbent layer because of the surface passivation  Furthermore  the enhancement of VOC is due to the in-situ growth of ( PDA ) PbI4 as a 2D interface layer between ( FAPbI3 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015 and CuSCN  which can induce a more effective interaction between absorbent layer and HTL  leading to accelerate the hole transfer to the upper layers by strong contact of perovskite and CuSCN13  Additionally  the different trend is obtained for FF change  that it is declined for device B1 and then increased for device C1 ( Fig  3c )  It is reasonably assumed that the thickness of ( PDA ) PbI4 layer on the perovskite film surface depends on the PDAI amount in the precursor solution  In other words  ( PDA ) PbI4 film will be produced with inadequate thickness and incomplete coverage for a small quantity of PDAI ( 3 mg mL−1 ) in the precursor solution  So  the initial decrease of FF of device C1 might be related to the incomplete conversion of PbI2 into 2D ( PDA ) PbI4  which is the statement of the thickness and coverage importance for 2D perovskite21  By spin-coating of 5 mg mL−1 of PDAI solution on the 3D perovskite film  JSC  VOC and FF values are increased  and the highest performance is achieved for device C1 with an optimal PCE of 1610 % ( Fig  3d )  a JSC of 2145 mA cm−2  a VOC of 109 V  and FF of 7021 %  The device C1 shows a champion efficiency of 1752 %  as shown in Supplementary Table S9  Figure 3 figure 3 Statistic ( a ) JSC  ( b ) VOC  ( c ) FF  and ( d ) PCE of devices A1–F1  ( e ) J–V curves of devices measured in reverse scan at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 under AM 15G  ( f ) The corresponding IPCE spectra of the best performing device C1 and controlled device A1 in which dashed lines stand

which was reported a PCE of 1675 %  a JSC of 2193 mA cm−2 and a VOC of 1068 V for champion cell21  The higher value of PCE and JSC might be related to different perovskite composition  Contrary  the obtained VOC is greater for our study  The F1 device shows a decreased PCE of 960 %  The unreacted diammonium can be trapped in the GBs of perovskite films and make adversely impact on the device performance  Also  the excess value of PDAI can increase series resistance  resulting in a decline of JSC  VOC and PCE  The IPCE spectra of devices A1 and C1 are summarized in Fig  3f  The device C1 indicates higher IPCE than A1 between 350 and 750 nm  It is interesting that the absorption range of devices is almost the same  which points out that the 2D perovskite interface layer does not cause a significant change in the ( FAPbI3 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015 bandgap  The integrated currents of devices A1 and C1 are 1877 and 2173 mA cm−2  respectively  which are in good agreement with the corresponding values in Fig  3a  J-V hysteresis in PSCs is an important issue since it is related to the stability38  The causes of hysteresis have been reviewed as follows : Charge trapping/de-trapping related to the surface defects and corresponding density at the interfaces39  Ferroelectric polarization in perovskite materials40 and ion migration41  Accordingly  the J–V curves of devices under different scan directions were recorded after 30 days and shown in Supplementary Fig  S7  Devices were stored at ambient atmosphere ( 15 ± 5 % RH ) in the dark  The corresponding parameters of the devices are inserted in Table 1  The hysteresis index ( HI ) is calculated as Eq  ( 1 ) 42 : { text { HI } } = left [ { { text { J } } _ { { { text { RS } } } } left ( { 0  { text {

PDAI post-treatment  with different scanning directions  after one-month maintenance in the ambient condition with 15 ± 5 % RH and dark  Full size table where JFS ( 08 VOC ) and JRS ( 08 VOC ) show current density at 80 % of VOC for the forward and reverse scan  respectively  Devices A1 ( HI = − 0219 ) and B1 ( HI = − 205 ) show similar hysteresis  Significantly reduced hysteresis is obtained for device C1 ( HI = − 0027 ) in comparison to devices A1 and B1  which is attributed to the decrease of the defect and trap sites by PDAI passivation and 2D layer formation as showed by SEM and XRD results  By spin-coating of the optimum value of PDAI ( 5 mg mL−1 ) on pristine film  more compact ( FAPbI3 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015 film with a lower density of GBs is achieved  It is reported that defects are made by vacancies in perovskite  The applied external electric field can create a driving force for ions and vacancies  especially through the GBs  These ions and vacancies can be accumulated at the perovskite-HTL and ETL interface  leading to interrupt the photo-generated electron and hole extraction due to increased capacitance  So  GB engineering is a key issue in hysteresis reduction38  It is reported that the passivation agents spun on the pristine film can penetrate the perovskite film via GBs43  So  PDAI can passive the iodide-rich trap sites at the GBs and suppress iodide ion migration to the interfaces under applied bias  Also  2D perovskite ( ( PDAI ) PbI4 ) will be able to decrease hysteresis through the effective physical barrier providing high activation energy for diffusion to hinder the ion migration and charge accumulation near the perovskite/HTL junctions44  It indicates that PDAI not only passivates the GBs in bulk perovskite but also cause to more compact film with a lower density of GBs  So  it can suppress the charges and ions accumulations at interfaces and prevents interface electrode polarization  So  interfacial and also bulk perovskite engineering is both supposed by PDAI  To check the reliability of PCE obtained for the fabricated devices  the stabilized photocurrent was measured at voltages corresponding to maximum output power and plotted as a function of time  Figure 4 displays the J−t and PCE-t plots  The comparison of J−t and PCE–t curves for device A1 and C1 indicates that the JSC and PCE of device A1 are unstable during continuous illumination  Such instability property can be improved by making a 2D layer at perovskite/CuSCN interface because of the halide migration inhibition at GBs45  Figure 4

of the unencapsulated devices A1  B1  C1  D1  E1 and F1 under ( c ) thermal cycle ( one cycle : heating at 85 °C for 30 min and cooling down to room temperature for 1 h in ambient condition with 15 ± 5 % RH  ( d ) humidity aging at 90 ± 5 % RH and ( e ) humidity aging at 15 ± 5 % RH  in the dark  The data were obtained in reverse scan at a scan rate 50 mV s−1 under AM 15G  Three cells were tested for each kind of device  Full size image The time-dependent degradation of devices is investigated to study the correlation between stability and surface passivation  The thermal stability of unencapsulated devices is studied by keeping them at 85 °C with 15 ± 5 % RH ( Fig  4c  and Supplementary Tables S1–S6 )  The devices A1  B1  C1  D1  E1 and F1 show 5493 %  6299 %  9023 %  7997 %  6996 % and 6001 % of initial PCE after 6 thermal cycles  respectively  In the case of a pristine device ( A1 )  the PCE is declined during temperature cycles and finally reduced to half of the initial value  In contrast  the PCE of device C1 is obtained 90 % after 6 cycles  It is interesting that the declined PCE value of device C1 is gradually recovered again after 3 cycles  The raised temperature in the solar cell speeds up FA+ and MA+ vibration  and thereby throws out the organic cations from the perovskite lattice  leading to irreversible thermal decomposition4647  Comparably  perovskite films post-treated with the appropriate amount of PDAI exhibit some self-healing properties in the thermal aging test ( device C1 )  In this device  the GBs are passivated by PDAI  and the traps in the heterojunction region of GBs are connected together by diammonium cations  In addition  the ammonium both ends of the molecule can crosslink perovskite grains through hydrogen bonds to form a dense perovskite film and suppress the A+ migration far from the [ PbX6 ] 4− octahedral frame  So  during the self-healing process  the perovskite film will be reconstructed to the 3D lattice structure  Simultaneously  the main problem of perovskite materials is moisture instability because of the hygroscopic nature of 3D perovskite materials  So  3D perovskite is decomposed into PbI2 upon contact with water  The perovskite films ( A1 to F1 ) were kept in home-made equipment with controlled 90 ± 5 % RH at room temperature ( Supplementary Fig  S8 )  Figure 5a shows the optical images obtained during the aging test  The UV–Vis spectra of the films are also illustrated in Fig  5b–g  It is completely obvious that ( FAPbI3 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015 is decomposed to the PbI2 yellow phase after 30 d In agreement with the visual observation  the UV–Vis spectra show a regular decline of absorbance intensity  All of the perovskite films passivated by different concentrations of PDAI are degraded at almost the same rate in the first 10 day  Degradation rate is accelerated in the film B1  D1  E1 and F1 after 20 d ( especially for film B1 and F1 )  whereas no further degradation is obtained for the films C1  In order to more deeply investigate the device stability against the moisture  the devices were aged at low and high relative humidity  and the J-V curves were recorded  As shown in Fig  4d  and Supplementary Tables S7–S12  the PCE of unencapsulated device A1 is sharply decreased and received to 5802 % of initial PCE during 5 h in high 90 ± 5 % RH  The PCEs of devices C1 and D1 are maintained 9901 % and 9399 % of the initial value after 5 h  respectively  At higher concentrations of PDAI ( 15 mg mL−1 )  the excess amount of diammonium salts is trapped in the GBs and deteriorates device stability  Finally  the comparison of device stability in low 15 ± 5 % RH shows that the PDAI-treated PSC is less degraded than the ( FAPbI3 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015 device ( device A1 ) according to Fig  4e  and Supplementary Tables S13–S18  The pristine device ( A1 ) shows 7227 % of its initial PCEs under a 15 ± 5 % RH  Almost no degradation of device C1 under low 15 ± 5 % RH corroborates that the PDAI passivation can effectively hinder moisture destruction  Stability tests confirmed that device C1 is the most stable device  It is due to the post-treatment of PDAI on the perovskite film  which leads to the in-situ growth of the hydrophobic 2D interface layer and thus repels water molecules  This will create a layer of hydrophobic and thus repel water molecules  On the other side  water adsorption on the perovskite surface can not be completely avoided ; the passivation of GBs and defects by PDAI can suppress the perovskite solar cell degradation  The findings strongly propose that PDAI passivation can effectively protect the perovskite film from moisture  So  we thought about it to check the self-healing properties of the perovskite films  Figure 6a and b show a comparison of the color changes for perovskite layer without PDAI post-treatment ( film A1 ) and the perovskite layer with 5 mg mL−1 PDAI passivation ( film C1 ) after both were exposed with hot water vapor  In comparison  the film A1 is changed to yellow after 12 s of exposure to water vapor  but the color of the passivated film is remained black during this time and changed to brown after 30 s So  the pristine film is deteriorated in a humid environment more quickly that perovskite film passivated by PDAI  It is due to the in-situ growth of the 2D ( PDAI ) PbI4 layer on top of the 3D perovskite film  which can create a hydrophobic barrier layer on it  After being kept away from water vapor  the color of the pristine film has remained yellow  and it shows no self-healing behavior after 80 s  but the passivated perovskite film is changed to black color after 15 s of healing  The self-healing perovskite film was immediately exposed to the water vapor again  After 20 s of exposure to water vapor  the film color is changed to brownish-yellow  After being kept away from water vapor for 70 s  the film color is completely changed to black  This wonderful self-healing behavior is also displayed in 3:46 min video ( Supplementary Video S1 )  Whether the perovskite film in the device structure has such a self-healing ability is a little more complicated  In the configured device  the interaction between different layers is also a critical issue  and how much water molecules are absorbed on the ETL and HTL can affect the stability of the perovskite layer  So  the stability of the perovskite layer in the configured solar cell is also investigated  The self-healing ability of two PSCs spin-coating with 3 and 5 mg mL−1 PDAI is investigated for a deeper understanding of the PDAI concentration effect  The self-healing capability of devices B1 and C1 is vividly demonstrated in 2:25 min video ( Supplementary Video S2 )  Figure 6c shows a comparison of the color changes for devices B1 and C1  In the first cycle of water vapor contact  the color of device C1 remains almost constant  and a slight color change is observed for device B1 after 37 s of exposure  After 15 s healing step  the device B1 is refreshed again and became completely black  The frequent self-healing ability of devices is studied by device exposure to hot water vapor for 60 s ( Fig  6d )  In the second cycle  the color change of device B1 is more obvious than device C1  The adequate amount of PDAI concentration ( 5 mg mL−1 ) in device C1 has led to the in-situ growth of an ultra-thin and compact 2D ( PDAI ) 2PbI4 layer on ( FAPbI3 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015 film  This hydrophobic 2D layer on the surface of the 3D perovskite film can partially prevent the penetration of water molecules and provides a sufficient amount of moisture stability  The color of device C1 and B1 is returned black after 20 s and 30 s healing step  respectively  The self-healing ability of the device C1 is also confirmed by the J–V curves before and after hot water vapor exposure ( Fig  6e )  The J–V curves indicate that the device C1 can heal itself when it is kept away from hot water vapor and the J–V curve can return to its original shape  This self-healing ability is very suitable for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells since once the device is exposed to the humid environment  the solar cell can self-heal to high PCE again in a short time when it returns to sunlight again  Moreover  The self-healing process is studied by XRD analysis ( Fig  6f )  The strong peak at 127° indicates that PbI2 phase is formed during hot water vapor exposure  After self-healing  the PbI2 peak is disappeared and the perovskite film is recovered to its original crystal phase  Figure 5

explain such a self-healing ability in the passivated PSCs  it is necessary to explain the exact mechanism of moisture degradation in the perovskite film  The destruction of perovskite films is more considered in the GBs and interfaces48  A possible mechanism for irreversible decomposition of perovskite films has been suggested by Choi and coworkers49  It is suggested that the irreversible degradation of perovskite materials only happens while both charges and moisture exist simultaneously  In the first step  perovskite films form hydrates in the presence of water molecules  The [ PbX6 ] 4− octahedra interacts with both organic cations ( MA+  FA+ ) and H2O within the hydrated perovskite50  Next  the trapped charge ( X− ) at the defects causes to the organic cation deprotonation and producing volatile molecules like CH3CH2 ( MA ) and HC ( = NH ) NH2 ( FA ) 49 : left ( begin { array } { c } { mathrm { CH } } _ { 3 } { mathrm { NH } } _ { 3 }  { { mathrm { HC } ( mathrm { NH } } _

side  leading to irreversible degradation of perovskite film  The self-healing mechanism of the passivated perovskite film is shown in Fig  7  Interestingly  the hydrogen atoms available in the diammonium cations ( PDA ) can interact with iodide in [ PbX6 ] 4− octahedra via hydrogen bonding and create passivation in the GBs of perovskite  The degradation of perovskite is started once the perovskite film is exposed to water vapor  In the pristine film  the perovskite grains start to disintegrate away from each other  So  the MA+ and FA+ ions are driven through channels and interact with the nearest trapped charges to make volatile molecules  Therefore  the irreversible degradation of pristine perovskite will be happening according to the reaction ( 2 )  and the color of the film remains yellow  In the case of passivated perovskite film with PDAI  the GBs are attached strongly because of the presence of two ammonium groups at both ends of the benzene ring  So  the MA+ and FA+ migrations are partially suppressed through the interconnected GBs  On the other hand  the aromatic ring of phenyl diammonium can suppress the trapped charge migration towards organic cations  All of these can inhibit the deprotonation of organic cations and results in organic cation anchors in the nearest place to the [ PbX6 ] 4− octahedra rather than escape away  After being kept away from water vapor  the decomposition reaction can take place in the backward direction again  very similar to the two-step synthesis of perovskite film according to the reaction ( 3 )  The consecutive decomposition-recombination mechanism expresses the rapid self-healing process in the scaffold perovskite film with the 5 mg mL−1 PDAI  Figure 7 figure 7 Schematic diagram to show mechanisms for the self-healing properties in device C1  Full size image Methods Materials 5 g of formamidinium acetate ( Aldrich  99 % ) was dissolved in 10 mL hydroiodic acid ( 57 % in water  Merck ) and stirred for 2

transport material  sodium thiosulfate ( Na2S2O35H2O  Merck ) was used as a non-toxic reducing agent  Initially  50 mL of a 01 M aqueous copper ( II ) sulfate ( CuSO45H2O  Merck ) solution was mixed with 50 mL of a 01 M aqueous Na2S2O3 solution and stirred for 1 h The solution color change from blue to light green indicated the conversion of Cu ( II ) ions to Cu ( I )  Subsequently  50 mL of a 01 M aqueous potassium thiocyanate ( KSCN  Merck ) solution was slowly added in a dropwise manner for 2 h After this step  the solution color changed to whitish because of the growth of CuSCN crystals  Finally  the dispersed particle was separated by centrifugation and washed with deionized water and subsequently with absolute ethanol three times  The CuSCN powder was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C

absolute ethanol at 1500 rpm for 20 s The film was then sintered at 500 °C for 1 h The mesoporous TiO2 ( mp-TiO2 ) layer was deposited by spin-coating TiO2 paste ( IRASOL PST-20 T ) diluted in absolute ethanol by 1:5 weight ratio at 3000 rpm for 20 s  and the substrate was sintered at 500 °C for 30 min  Perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving of FAI  MABr  PbI2 ( 9999 %  IRASOL ) and PbBr2 ( 9999 %  IRASOL ) with 1 M  02 M  11 M and 02 M concentrations in N–N-dimethylformamide ( DMF 995 %  Merck ) and dimethyl sulfoxide  ( DMSO 999 %  Merck ) mixed solvent ( DMF : DMSO  4:1 volume ratio )  For the absorbent layer  45 μL of prepared perovskite solution was poured onto the mp-TiO2 layer and spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 10 s and then 3000 rpm for 40 s Finally  500 μL of ethyl acetate ( EtOAc 995 %  Merck ) was poured onto the perovskite surface before finishing the spin-coating process  The film was annealed at 130 °C for half one hour  Different concentrations of PDAI were dissolved in 2-propanol ( 3  5  7  10 and 15 mg mL−1 ) and spin-coated on the surface of the ( FAPbI3 ) 085 ( MAPbBr3 ) 015 films at 3000 rpm for 20 s and the films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min  Finally  the CuSCN layer was deposited by spin-coating of 50 μL CuSCN solution ( 40 mg mL−1 ) in dipropyl sulfide ( DPS 999 %  Merck ) /acetonitrile ( ACN 999 %  Merck ) mixed solvents at 5000 rpm for 20 s After that  the CuSCN film was annealed at 60 °C for 15 min  Finally  gold thermal evaporation was performed to generate a 50 nm Au metal layer on top of the HTL as a counter electrode  The whole process of the PSCs fabrication was performed in ambient conditions  except for the gold evaporation process  Measurement and characterization The X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) spectra of the prepared perovskite films were recorded by PANalytical  X ’ Pert Pro MPD  with an X-ray tube ( Cu Kα  λ = 15406 Å )  The morphology of the films was studied by a field-emission scanning electron microscope ( Philips  Model XL30 )  UV–Vis spectra were observed by the UV–Vis spectrometer ( 400–1000 nm wavelength range  PerkinElmer Lambda25 )  Photocurrent density–voltage ( J–V ) curves were

its outstanding optical and electronic properties such as high absorption coefficient long carrier diffusion lengths  long carrier mobility and unique defect physics  As a result  the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of PSCs rapidly enhanced from 38 to 24 % through the advancement made in processing methods  compositional tuning  and interface engineering  The dominant PSCs architecture has been evolved ; n–i–p and p–i–n with mesoporous and planar heterojunction  In both configurations  ie  planar or mesoporous  the perovskite material is sandwiched between electron and hole transporting layers and top electrode  The basic function of charge transporting layers is to improve charge collection efficiency and reduce charge recombination at interfaces  In the following chapter  we present the critical survey of the recent progress in perovskite absorber and charge transporting materials for the exceptionally higher PCE of perovskite devices  Furthermore  numerous fabrication techniques and device architectures are summarized  Keywords Photovoltaics Third-generation solar cells Perovskite materials Perovskite solar cells Heterojunction Access provided by SpringerLink Jiangsu eBook Consortium 2016-2018 copyright years Download chapter PDF 1 Introduction The perovskite solar cells are evolved from dye-sensitized solar cells ( DSSC )  The mesoscopic DSSC was first reported by Micheal Gratzel and O ’ Ragan in 1991 [ 1 ]  A power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 7 % was reported using Ruthenium dye absorbed on mesoscopic film of nanocrystalline TiO2 [ 1 ]  This discovery opened a new frontier in the race of developing the solar energy harvesting technologies  A characteristic liquid DSSC consists of a photoanode  which is usually a glass coated with the transparent conducting oxide ( TCO )  a mesoporous TiO2 with the sensitized dye absorbed onto it  and electrolyte ( typically an iodine/iodide redox couple )  and a platinized counter electrode  The schematics representation and the working principle of DSSC and device architecture are shown in Fig  1 [ 1 ]  After the absorption of photons  the electrons are excited from Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital ( HOMO ) to Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital ( LUMO ) of dye  Meanwhile  the electrons are injected from LUMO into the conduction band of the TiO2  which is acting as electron transporting layer  The electrons are collected at corresponding electrode via diffusion process through mesoporous TiO2 layer  At counter electrode  the electrolyte is reduced by the electrons approaching through the external circuit [ 2  3 ]  Until now  an impressive efficiency up to 13 % has been achieved for the devices made in the laboratory and 10 % for the prototype modules [ 4  5 ]  However  electrolyte leakage  instability and its corrosive nature are the main difficulties towards the commercialization of liquid DSSC [ 6 ]  Subsequently  Batch et al  in [ 7 ] first reported solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells ( ss-DSSC ) with PCE of 074 % [ 7 ]  In 2011  a record PCE of 74 % has been achieved by optimizing the various components of ss-DSSC [ 8 ]  In 2012  thin-film photovoltaics technologies have been revolutionized with the substation of dye with the organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite ( PS ) absorber [ 9  10 ]  Fig  1 figure 1 Schematic representation of  a components of solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell ( ss-DSSC )  b working principle of ss-DSSC  reproduced with permission from royal society of chemistry  Ref  [ 92 ] Full size image Perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) based on organometal trihalide material ( MAPbI3 ) have engrossed enormous research interest for solar cell applications [ 101112 ]  due to their outstanding optical and electronic properties such as high absorption coefficient [ 13 ]  long carrier diffusion lengths [ 14  15 ]  long carrier mobility and unique defect physics  [ 16 ] As the result  the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of PSCs rapidly enhanced from 38 % to 221 % [ 17 ] through the advancement made in processing methods via compositional engineering [ 18 ]  interface engineering [ 19  20 ]  The advantage of PSCs over conventional silicon solar cells is their low cost and simple manufacturing process  However  for the conventional silicon solar cells  the manufacturing process is multistep  and each step being operated at high temperature ( > 1000 °C ) in highly evacuated chamber  However  synthesis of perovskite material is simple by wet chemical method in non-evacuated ambient conditions  2 Perovskite Material for Solar Cell Applications The PSCs based on the light harvester and charge carrier conductor that is actually an organic-inorganic lead or tin halide compound also called perovskite compound  The perovskite refers to the class of material that has the general formula of ABX3  where A and B are the cations having different atomic radii  and X is an anion bond to both  The crystal structure of methylammonium lead halide perovskite is shown in Fig  2  In methylammonium lead halide ( CH3NH3PbX3 )  the CH3NH3+ cation ion is surrounded by the octahedra of PbX6  The X ions are highly mobile and can be localized through the whole crystal structure  The activation energy of X ions is 06 eV  which is dependent on the axial to axial  equatorial to axial or equatorial to equatorial bond position of halide anions  With the CH3NH3PbI3  the record PCE od > 20 % has been achieved successfully after an extensive research [ 11 ]  This PCE is higher than the traditional DSSC and organic solar cells [ 17  19 ]  Fig  2 figure 2 Typical crystal structure of perovskite materials  based on the data of Ref  [ 93 ] Full size image The perovskite material CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3 firstly reported as light harvesting material for solar cells by Kojima et al  [ 17 ] with the record efficiency of 381 %  Later  this PCE had been further improved to 654 % by introducing the CH3NH3PbI3 quantum dots ( QDs ) spin-coated TiO2 surface using perovskite precursor solution [ 21 ]  The PCE of PSCs had been improved further up to 97 % by the development of mesoscopic heterojunction solar cells with the use of CH3NH3PbI3 as light harvester [ 21 ]  These perovskite materials were produced by reaction between methylammonium iodide and lead iodide  and then deposited on the TiO2 surface having the thickness of micrometre  The 22′77′-tetrakis ( N  N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine ) -99′-spirobifluorene ( spiro-OMeTAD ) was used as hole transporting layer ( HTL )  Later  Lee et al  [ 17 ] have reported comparatively low cost  solution-processable PSCs with the improved PCE up to 109 %  This type of solar cells employed mesoporous alumina ( Al2O3 ) as a chemically inactive layer which acts as scaffold for perovskite material and also forces the electron to move within the perovskite film [ 17 ]  Liu et al  [ 22 ] have proved that the nanostructure is not an essential requirement to obtain higher performance with perovskite material  They fabricated the planar heterojunction ( PHJ ) solar cells with vapour deposited perovskite film and achieve PCE of 15 % under one sun illumination conditions [ 22 ]  This achievement has demonstrated that the PSCs with simple structure can attain higher power conversion efficiencies  therefore avoiding pointless complications related with the use of nanostructures  The efficiencies of PSCs have been further improved by the Zhou et al  [ 19 ] group  They use yttrium ( Y ) doped TiO2 as electron transport layer ( ETL ) to boost up the carrier concentration and modified indium tin oxide ( ITO )  yielding an PCE of 193 % [ 19 ]  Jeng et al  [ 23 ] developed a new method to construct inverted planar heterojunction ( PHJ ) PSCs  The device architecture for PHJ solar cells can be of two types depending on the p–i–n heterojunction scheme employed : ( a ) normal devices having poly ( 34-ethylenedioxythiophene ) polystyrene sulphonate ( PEDOT : PSS ) acting as a hole transporting layer  perovskite as intrinsic layer  and PCBM or fullerene derived [ 6  6 ] -phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester as an electron transporting layer [ 23 ]  ( b ) an inverted structure with compact TiO2 as n-doped  perovskite as undoped or intrinsic and organic semiconductor as p-doped region [ 24 ]  Nie et al  [ 25 ] have employed solution-based hot casting technique to fabricate highly uniform pinhole free film of perovskite material having millimetre-sized crystalline grain  approaching PCE of 18 % [ 25 ]  The power conversion efficiency has been increased further to 183 % by growing perovskite film with large grain size on several HTLs  and decreasing recombination of carrier at grain boundaries [ 26 ]  The advantages of exploiting conventional and inverted PHJ structure are that the mesoscopic metal oxide layer can be dispensed  that leads to the fabrication process more facile [ 27 ]  Figure 1 depicted the device architecture of conventional and inverted PHJ perovskite solar cells  The electron and hole transporting layers act as an interfacial modifier  while metallic layer and TCO layer function as conducting electrode  The perovskite layer acts as light harvester and transports the charges till their arrival to the corresponding electrodes  Thus  research has been focussed on the development of techniques to prevent the recombination of charges  including interfacial engineering which is the main technique to suppress the charge recombination at electrodes and perovskite interface [ 28  29 ]  3 Compositional Aspect of Perovskite Material The most frequently considered perovskite materials for photovoltaics ( PV ) applications are CH3NH3PbI3  CH3NH3PbI3−xClx  CH3NH3PbBr3  CH3NH3Pb ( I1−xBrx ) 3  HC ( NH2 ) 2PbI3  CH ( NH2 ) 2 Pb ( I1−xBrx ) 3  CH3NH3SnI3  The properties of perovskite material can be tuned further by substituting various cations and anions at the AMX3 sites of the perovskite  31 ‘ A ’ Site The electronic properties of perovskite material are not directly affected by the A cation  However  it has been demonstrated via simulation that the crystal structure of perovskite material is affected by the size of A cation  which ultimately changing the electronic properties of the perovskite material [ 30 ]  A three-dimensional symmetrical crystal structure can be achieved by substituting a ‘ A ’ site vacancy with a small cation like caesium ( Cs )  rubidium ( Rb )  methylammonium ( MA ) and formamidinium ( FA ) [ 31 ]  Methylammonium ( MA ) : The most frequently used cation in organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite material is the methylammonium ( MA )  The PSCs employing MA cation in hybrid perovskite material has attained the efficiencies of more than 15 %  The MA cation is most commonly used in methylammonium lead triiodide ( CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3 ) perovskite material  The MAPbI3 develops the tetragonal crystal structure rather than the cubic structure  which might be due to the very small size of MA+ cation  The resulting band gap of 151–155 eV is obtained which is greater than the optimized Shockley–Queisser limit for mono-junction device [ 32  33 ]  The band gap was further tuned by replacing the MA+ cation with the bigger cation  which improves the light absorption throughout the spectrum  The replacement of smaller cation with the bigger one imparted the better crystal symmetry which results in smaller band gap and improved light absorption  The other cations that have been explored are ethylammonium ( EA )  formamidinium ( FA ) and caesium ( Cs )  The replacing MA+ cation with bigger cation “ of having larger ionic radii ” such as EA results in distortion of three-dimensional crystal structure  The ethyl ammonium lead triiodide ( CH3CH2NH3PbI3 ) develops a two-dimensional orthorhombic crystal structure having band gap of 22 eV  A relatively lower PCE of 22 % was recorded for PSCs employing CH3CH2NH3PbI3 as light harvester under standard illumination conditions [ 31 ]  Formamidinium ( FA ) : FA cation has been estimated to result in a better symmetry than that of MA and therefore has been broadly investigated  The FA crystal possesses advantageous bad-gap of 143–148 eV  However  Formamidinium lead triiodide ( FAPbI3 ) develops a yellow colour hexagonal one-dimensional non-perovskite polymorph at room temperature showing serious band coordination with TiO2 [ 31 ]  This results in lower photovoltaic performance of PSCs using FAPbI3 as light harvester [ 31 ]  It has been anticipated further that the complete removal of this non-perovskite polymorph state of FAPbI3 would increase the PCE of FA-based devices even more than that of MA-based PSCs  Caesium ( Cs ) : The Cs-based perovskite was first explored by the Scaife et al  [ 32 ]  It was investigated that the caesium tin triiodide ( CsSnI3 ) -based perovskite showed highly intense photoluminescence ( PL ) peak for near infrared region of the solar spectrum [ 34 ]  The four different crystal structure of CsSnI3 that was present independently at room temperature was investigated by Chung et al  [ 35 ]  The small size of Cs as compared to MA results in a higher band gap of 173 eV for CsPbI3 over MA PbI3 ( 157 eV )  more than the appropriate bang-gap of 14 eV [ 33 ] suitable for PV applications  Mixed A cations perovskites : Mixed A cations perovskites combine the strong characteristics of individual components  It was first reported by the Pellet et al  [ 29 ]  They modify the band gap of mixed A cation perovskite material by changing its composition  They reported the mixed A cations perovskite  ie  methylammonium formamidinium lead triiodide ( MAxFA1−xPbI3 ) with the different compositional ratio of MA to FA and ultimately achieving the PCE of 149 % [ 29 ]  The improved PCE of these devices compared with MA-based PSCs is due to the higher light absorption by perovskite layer in red region of solar spectrum  Mei et al  realize perovskite solar cells built on 5-aminovaleric acid ( 5-AVAI ) xMA1−xPbI3 perovskite material with reduced defects [ 36 ]  This results in improved carrier lifetime and reduced recombination as compared to the unchanged MAPbI3  A PCE of 128 % was reported with enhanced stability under light and ambient conditions  32 ‘ M ’ Site The M site of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite material is usually occupied by the metal cations of group IV A  The most commonly used ions of group IV A in +2 oxidation state are Lead ( Pb )  Tin ( Sn ) and Germanium ( Ge )  The most extensively used metal of group IVA is the lead metal  as it showed much better performance and stability as compared to the tin metal ( Sn ) [ 37  38 ]  However  Ge has not often been explored in +2 oxidation state due to its mercurial characters in this state [ 39 ]  Due to the inert electron pair effects  the +2-oxidation state becomes less stable as we move down the group IV A  ie  from Pb to Ge  However  reduction in band gap is observed due to increase in ionic characters moving down the group  Hypothetically  MASnX3 shows band-gap value of 12–14 eV as compared to MAPbX3 that has the band-gap value of 16–18 eV  However  the drawback of MASnX3 is the instability of Sn in +2 oxidation state  It is readily oxidized in air producing volatile SnI4 compound  MASnX3-based PSCs showed better current density ( Jsc ) than the solar devices based on MAPbX3  yet its unstable nature has hindered its further development [ 38 ]  Mixed M cations : The band gap has been changed effectively by changing the ratio of Pb to Sn in CH3NH3Sn1−xPbxI3 perovskite-based devices [ 31  40 ]  It has been observed that by increasing the Sn contents up to x = 05  a quasi cubic tetragonal structure is formed similar to the pure MASnI3 [ 31 ]  By increasing the Sn contents further  a tetragonal structure has been observed  A tetragonal structure with increased absorptivity and decreased band gap was observed by further increasing the Sn contents [ 31 ]  A lot of development has been accomplished in dual metal hybrid perovskite devices as elaborated elsewhere [ 41 ]  33 ‘ X ’ Site Changing the halide ion is the best method to probe the performance characteristics of hybrid perovskite photovoltaics  In moving down the group VIIA  atomic size increases  absorption spectra shifted towards longer wavelength  and a decrease in energy is observed [ 40 ]  Iodide ( I ) : The PSCs based on iodide ions are the most important one reaching PCE over 20 % [ 23  42 ]  The electronegativity value of iodine ( 266 ) is closer to that of lead ( 233 ) thus leading to the most stable perovskite structure  The bond between iodine and lead is neither covalent nor ionic rather mixed characters  Although iodide forms the most basic components of hybrid halide perovskite  its instability towards humidity is a problem  Therefore  more study is encouraged to realize iodide substitute and mixed halide perovskite  Chloride ( Cl ) : The PSCs containing Cl-based perovskite material showed better efficiencies as incorporation of Cl in perovskite material results in longer carrier diffusion lengths and better charge carrier lifetimes [ 43 ]  MAPbCl3 exhibits the cubic structure at ambient temperature ; nevertheless  blended CH3NH3PbI3−xClx produced remarkably aligned crystalline arrangement [ 44 ]  Furthermore  X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) studies have confirmed the arrangement of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx similar to MAPbI3  having maximum 3–4 % Cl to I ratio [ 45 ]  Dar et al  [ 46 ]  however  showed that Cl remains unconverted into CH3NH3PbI3−xClx as PbCl2 that works as nucleation vacancies leading to improved surface masking of perovskite layer [ 46 ]  It is proposed that crystallization starts with the formation of complex ion agglomerates due to the limited solubility of the precursor containing chlorine  Chlorine allows freezing of redundant organic components by restructuring of components ions amid crystal growth  that in-turn ascertain the crystal and grain structure of perovskite material  Thus  chlorine incorporation controls the morphological evolution of the film and hence plays a role in tuning material characteristics and solar cell efficiency  Bromide ( Br ) : Bromine is effectively used to tune the band gap of the perovskite material [ 33 ]  It has been proposed by the Moscon et al  [ 43 ] that the introduction of Br ions in iodide-based perovskite materials results in increased in band gap of material as the result of crystal distortion [ 43 ]  Pure MAPbBr3 showed cubic crystal structure at room temperature [ 44 ]  The PSCs based on CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx showed superior efficiency and stability by changing the band gap through chemical combination [ 47 ]  Moreover  Eperon et al  established the result of changing the I : Br ratios on mixed halide FAPbI3−xBrx perovskite  representing an variable band gap from 148 to 223 eV with a range of film colour [ 33 ]  The highest PCE achieved was 142 % with higher Jsc of 23 mA/cm2  Complex ions : Lately  mixed perovskite MAPbI3−x ( BF4 ) x was synthesized by the Nagane et al  [ 48 ]  They replaced the X ion with the BF4− molecular ion [ 48 ]  The MAPbI3−x ( BF4 ) x perovskite showed better electrical conductivities and improved response to photons under one sun illumination conditions in contrast to MAPbI3  Because of strong hydrogen bond between halide BF4− ion and MA ion  a lower degree of vitalization of MA ion is expected [ 30 ]  4 Structure  Phase Transformation and Electronic Characteristics of Perovskite Materials Perovskites refer to a class of materials that have the general formula of ABX3  where A and B are the two cations with very different atomic radii and X an anion  The A cation is always occupied the cubooctahedral site of perovskite material  while B cation is always present in an octahedral site  The oxidation states of A and B cations depend mainly on the nature of X anion  If X = Oxygen  then A and B sites are commonly filled by the divalent and tetravalent cations  However  when X = halogen  then A and B sites are occupied by the monovalent and divalent cations [ 49 ]  Perovskite material is broadly studied as light harvesting material for PV devices because one can substitute a variety of elements having varied oxidation states at A and B sites of this material  The most meritorious CH3NH3PbI3 has CH3NH3+occupying A site  while Pb+2 present at B site as demonstrated in Fig  2  The optical  electronic and structural properties of perovskite material are directly influenced by the ion arrangement and crystal constituents  The formability and stability of perovskites are determined by a dimensionless factor called Goldschmidt tolerance_factor ( t ) given below  where rA is the radius of cation A  rB is the radius of cation B  and rX is the radius of X anion  A cubic structure is predicted for the perovskite material containing transition metal cation and oxide anion with t = 1  whereas octahedral distortion is observed when t < 1 [ 50 ]  When t < 1  the loss in symmetry is observed which in turn effects the electronic properties of perovskite material [ 50 ]  For the perovskite material  the stable crystal structure is formed when tolerance_factor is 0813 < t < 1107 [ 51 ]  It is reported in literature that cation with ionic radii of 166 and 250 Å is suitable for the formation of stable APbX3 ( X = Cl  Br  I ) type perovskite material  The crystal structure of perovskite material has been confirmed by the XRD studies  The reported crystal structures for perovskite material through XRD studies are cubic ( Pm3 m )  tetragonal ( 14/mcm ) and orthorhombic ( Pnma ) [ 52 ]  At ambient temperature  perovskite material possesses cubic crystal structure  which undergoes series of phase transformation with decreasing temperature [ 53 ]  Perovskite crystal structure becomes more symmetric as temperature increases : at room temperature  MAPbI3 attains tetragonal structure  whereas MAPbBr3 and MAPbCI3 acquire cubic structures [ 54 ]  Phase transition in methylammonium ( MA )  formamidinium ( FA )  lead ( Pb )  Tin ( Sn ) and perovskite has been studied by Kanatzidis et al  [ 31 ]  They pointed out the three different transition states : at high temperature α state exists  while at intermediate temperature β state and at low-temperature gamma ( γ ) state exist as depicted in Table 1 [ 31 ]  It is clear from Table 1 that the FA-based perovskite materials do not undergo phase transformation even at high temperatures ; this property is highly substantial to fabricate solar cells for field operation  Thus  phase transformations that occur due temperature and pressure variation are the significant factor to be considered for practical application of PSCs  Table 1 Phase transformation of some common hybrid perovskite materials [ 30  31  99 ] Full size table In Table 2  the selective physical  electronics and spectroscopic properties of perovskite material used in PSCs are summarized  All perovskite materials have long carrier diffusion length with the almost equal exciton binding energy and thermal energy [ 55 ]  Furthermore  owing to very small exciton binding energy  both free electrical charges and infirm bound exciton coexists [ 56 ]  All perovskite materials possess direct band-gap and high absorption coefficient  ie  15 × 104 cm−1 at 550 nm [ 56 ]  The average diffusion length ( LD ) for MAPbCI3−XClx has been calculated using relation LD = ( Dτe ) 1/2 where D and τe are the coefficient of diffusion and recombination lifetime in the inexistence of a quenching components  respectively [ 56 ]  The values of D and τe were determined by the Stranks et al  by using photoluminescence quenching measurements  There reported values for MAPbCI3−XClx are more than 1 µm ( Table 2 )  Table 2 Physical  spectroscopic and electronic properties of some important perovskites Full size table 5 Band-gap Tuning of Perovskite Materials Hybrid perovskite materials exhibit larger absorption coefficient allowing the usage of very thin films for light absorption [ 57 ]  Perovskite material with the thickness of 500 nm absorbed the solar radiation that is equivalent to the absorption by 2 µm thickness of required by the typical silicon solar cells [ 30 ]  The perovskite material like MAPbI3 and MASnI3 has direct band gap that ranges from 150 to 155 eV as determined from the ultraviolet photoelectron and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer [ 17  22  28 ]  Nevertheless  the band gap of 155 eV is not enough for panchromatic absorption due to the relatively shorter absorption wavelength limited to 800 nm [ 28 ]  To increase the absorption of energy towards higher wavelength without cooperating for absorption coefficient  we can change the band gap of perovskite material  There are two possible ways to attain this : ( a ) replacing the MA cation with other organic cations  since replacement of MA with another cation alter the bond length and bond angle in M–X–M of ABX3 without changing the valence band maximum [ 58 ]  For example  the decreased in band gap of about 007 eV has been detected by replacing the MA cation with FA cation  The absorption wavelength is also increased by 40 nm approximately [ 31 ]  ( b ) directly altering the M–X bond [ 28 ]  For instance  when lead ion ( Pb2+ ) in MAPbI3 is partially replaced by the tin ion ( Sn2+ ) ion  the band gap reduces from 155 to 117 eV [ 59 ]  Therefore  one can change the band gap by changing the compositional ratio of Pb2+ to Sn2+  Moreover  direct modification of M–X bond in the perovskite material will consequently affect the valence band maximum ( VBM ) and conduction band minimum ( CBM )  as band edges are adjudged by the orbitals of B-position metals as established by fundamental computational studies [ 60 ]  Furthermore  band gap is also varied by changing the halide ions of M–X bond  A current study based on density functional theory ( DFT ) computations has discovered that electronic structures of CH3NH3PbI3 ( X = Cl  Br and I ) and CH3NH3PbI2X [ 43  60 ]  where the calculated band gap were in rough conformity with the experimental band-gap values for CH3NH3PbI3 with tetragonal ( 166 ( 155 )  183 ( 178 ) and 164 ( 155 ) ) eV for X = I  Br and Cl  correspondingly  The band-gap values for CH3NH3PbI3 with cubic structure are ( ( 157 ( 155 )  180 ( 200 ) and 234 ( 311 ) ) eV for X = I  Br  and Cl  respectively  ( the brackets values are experimental values )  Figure 3a  b shows the band-gap value diagram for ABX3 ( A = MA and FA  B = Pb  Sn  and X = Cl  Br or mixed Cl and Br ) [ 60 ]  Fig  3 figure 3 a Electronic absorption spectra of MAPb1−xSnxI3 [ 59 ]  b graphical sketch of energy level for MAPbBr3  MAPbI3  FAPbI3  MAPb1−xSnxI3  MASnI3 and TiO2 [ 94 ]  reproduced with permission from WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH and American chemical society Full size image The perovskite materials containing both Pb and Sn ions are divine contenders for very efficient PSCs  due to their appropriate optical band-gap and absorption characteristics  Pb-based perovskite materials like CH3NH3PbI3 and HC ( NH2 ) 2PbI3 have greater absorption coefficient as compared to the Sn-based perovskite materials [ 31 ]  6 Construction of Perovskite Solar Cells To attain the superior performance of PSCs it is very important to produce the high-quality perovskite film during the solar cell fabricating process  Therefore  research has been focussed to fabricate the high-quality perovskite film in term of crystallinity  morphology and better optoelectronic characters  The optoelectronic properties of perovskite film profoundly depend on the crystallinity which sequentially controls the morphology  Furthermore  the morphology of the perovskite film influences the efficiencies of charge separation  carrier diffusion lengths and charge recombination process in resultant perovskite film [ 30 ]  The morphology of perovskite film is controlled by several factors  such as method of deposition  heating temperature  annealing time  precursor materials ratio  and solvent and additives used [ 19  61 ]  It has been revealed that with the application of renewed and improved architecture in PSCs the PCE has been enhanced from 6 % through 123 % to 154 %  Still  even higher efficiencies have been reported with the other superior design of PSCs [ 19 ]  Each device type is manufactured on the standard architecture containing TiO2 acting as electron transporting layer ( ETL )  The electron transporting layer can be produced by several methods such as spray pyrolysis [ 42 ] or spin-coating [ 21 ] techniques  Commonly  the thickness of ETL used is almost 100–500 nm [ 62 ]  61 Preparation Methods for Perovskite Films The methods used for the fabrication of perovskite film have been broadly classified into three types : ( i ) solution process technique  ( ii ) vapour deposition and ( iii ) vapour assisted solution processing [ 22 ]  611 Solution Processing Techniques Solution processing technique for perovskite deposition is the utmost protruding technique as it is simplistic and low cost  The perovskite like CH3NH3PbI3 can be deposited on the substrate via two routes : ( i ) spin-coating an already mixed solution of CH3NH3I and PbI2  also called one-step spin-coating technique  ( ii ) spin-coating PbI2 with the subsequent deposition of CH3NH3I  also called two-step coating or sequential deposition method  One-step spin-coating is the utmost desirable method for manufacturing PSCs due to the compositional engineering of perovskite components  The precursor solution is prepared by mixing CH3NH3X ( X = Cl  Br  I ) powder and PbX2 ( X = Cl  Br  I ) in 1:1 stoichiometry  or in 3:1 in polar solvent ( like N  N-dimethylformamide DMF  gummabutyrolactone GBL or dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) [ 60 ]  Followed by spin-coating process the perovskite film is dried and annealed at different temperature depending upon the solvent used  In two-step fabrication process  the PbI2 layer is first deposited on the substrate followed by the spin-coating of CH3NH3I layer dissolved initially in 2-propanol ( IPA )  The steps involved in both one-step and two-step spin-coating is demonstrated in Fig  4a Several factors affect the film quality through these methods such as spin-coating speed and time  surrounding temperature  viscosity of solution and wettability  The perovskite film deposited by two-step spin-coating method shows cubic structure  whereas the film attained from one-step technique using dimethylacetamide ( DMA ) shows amorphous morphology [ 63  64 ]  A extra advance solution-based deposition process is the two-step sequential deposition technique to develop more uniform perovskite film as first introduced by the Liang et al  [ 57 ]  In this method  PbI2 film is first spin coated over mesoporous TiO2 layer  using specific spin-coating speed and time  The substrate is then soaked in the IPA solution containing appropriate concentration of CH3NH3I [ 63 ]  The PSCs showed PCE of greater than 15 %  when perovskite film is deposited by the two-step sequential deposition process [ 42 ]  Fig  4 figure 4 Typical methods of perovskite layer formation : a one-step and two-step methods [ 95 ]  b Co-evaporation employing PbCl2 and MAI double sources [ 96 ]  and d vapour assisted solution process employing organic vapours of MAI  that react with already accumulated PbI2 films [ 63 ]  Reproduced with permission from AIP [ 95 ]  WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH [ 96 ] and ACS [ 63 ] publications  respectively Full size image 612 Vapour Deposition Technique Vapour deposition technique was first developed by Snaith et al  [ 22 ] first used the vapour deposition technique to produce the perovskite film  They fabricated the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx- based PSCs by co-evaporation of CH3NH3I and PbCl2 ( Fig  4b ) [ 22 ]  The whole process was carried out under nitrogen-filled glove box under vacuum  The CH3NH3Iand PbCl2 was co-evaporated on fluorine doped tin oxide ( FTO ) substrate from the respective pots at 120 and 350 °C  The crystalline morphology was obtained after annealing as-deposited perovskite film [ 22 ]  A highly uniform  dense  pinhole free-perovskite film is obtained using this method  However  there is a limitation associated with this technique ; thermal evaporation required the evacuation of chamber at higher vacuum level which involves the high cost and thus mass production is not feasible [ 65 ]  This issue was overcome by the Yang et al  [ 66 ]  They established a low-temperature deposition technique called vapour assisted solution process ( VASP ) as shown in Fig  4c  The perovskite films formed by this method showed full surface coverage  high crystallinity and micrometre sized crystal grains  Recently  VASP method had been used to fabricate the CH3NH3PbI3 film having different thicknesses in planar device devices to get higher efficiency [ 66 ]  62 Device Architecture and Working Principle The device structure and working principle of PSCs are analogous to that of ss-DSSC as depicted in Fig  5  Mainly two kinds of device architecture are reported in PSCs ( normal structure and inverted structure )  as shown in Fig  5  Both structures mainly consist of transparent conductive oxide ( TCO  like FTO or indium doped tin oxide ( ITO ) )  electron transporting layer ( ETL ) layer  perovskite layer  hole transporting layer ( HTL ) and back contact ( like Ag and Au )  The energy level and working principle of PSCs are shown in Fig  2  When sunlight illuminates the perovskite active layer  excitons are generated and then separated into free carriers  Afterwards  generated electrons and holes can be transported to each interface and then injected of ETL and HTL  respectively  Finally  the electrons and holes in ETL and HTL are collected by working and counter electrodes  respectively  transported to external circuit and produce current [ 42  67 ]  According to the transient absorption spectroscopic studies  charge separation between perovskite and HTL was clearly detected  while electron injection at open-circuit condition was not clearly detected [ 68 ]  This indicates that HTL plays a critical role in carrier separation and transport in PSCs  The various device architectures have been discussed in the following section  Fig  5 figure 5 Schematics of architectures of perovskite SC in n–i–p and p–i–n configurations : a microscopic n–i–p  b planar n–i–p  c planar p–i–n and d mesoscopic p–i–n [ 80 ]  Reproduced with permission from Ref  [ 95 ] Full size image 621 The Mesoporous Scaffold Architecture The most dominating architecture in PSCs is with the mesoporous structure  It usually based on the solid-state DSSC architecture as shown in Fig  5a  In this architecture  the perovskite layer is fabricated within the interstice of mesoporous TiO2 layer [ 64 ]  This mesoporous TiO2 layer is essential to support the electron transport through the perovskite layer and FTO electrode [ 64 ]  The mesoporous TiO2 NP layer is produced by spin-coating a commercial TiO2 paste [ 42 ]  followed by sintering at 500 °C to afford improved connection among the TiO2 nanoparticles  Recently  TiO2 NP composite with graphene oxide has been employed as highly efficient ETL scaffold that improved the PCE up-to 156 % [ 69 ]  The graphene nanoflakes impart excellent charge collection dynamics within the nanocomposites that allow the fabrication of entire device architecture at 150 °C [ 69 ]  In addition  nanocrystalline TiO2 blended with the different metals have been reported [ 70 ]  More recently a researcher group has created CH3NH3PbI3−xClx PSCs built on the plastic film using amorphous SnO2 and mesoporous TiO2 layers as electrons collectors [ 71 ]  Later  same group fabricate the brookite-based PSCs using CH3NH3PbI3−xClx as a photoactive layer achieving the PCE of 138 % [ 72 ]  622 The Meso-Superstructure Architecture The more development in the structure of PSCs has been attained by Lee et al  [ 17 ]  They substituted the mesoporous TiO2 scaffold with the inert mesoporous Al2O3 network  This structure was named as ‘ meso-superstructured ’ thin-film PSCs [ 73 ]  The replacement of TiO2 scaffold with the inert mesoporous Al2O3 network gave superior optoelectronic characters to the perovskite film  which inspired researchers to further developed the planar architecture PSCs [ 30 ]  Another advantage of replacement of TiO2 scaffold with the inert mesoporous Al2O3 is that one can overcome the chemical instability issue of TiO2 under ultraviolet light ( UV ) [ 74 ]  The meso-superstructure PSCs were further established by the Ball et al  [ 73 ]  They used mixed halide perovskite material as light harvester and reported PCE of 123 % [ 73 ]  The mesoporous Al2O3 reduces the crystallite size of perovskite down to 100 nm as revealed by XRD and also acting as a shielding layer thwarting the current seepage at the electrode [ 73 ]  623 The Planar Architecture The planar heterojunction architecture was first established by the Liu et al  [ 22 ]  The planar structure contains perovskite layer that was vapour deposited and reported PCE was > 15 %  This type of architecture categorizes further into two types ; one is the normal with the normal configuration ( n–i–p ) and other with the inverted configuration ( p–i–n ) as depicted in ( Fig  5 )  The normal planar heterojunction consists of glass/TCO/ETL/perovskite/HTL/metal  while inverted heterojunction contains glass/TCO/HTL/perovskite/ETL/metal [ 30 ]  Generally  HTL/ETL acts as selective charge extraction layers [ 30 ]  The silver ( Ag ) and Gold ( Au ) are the normally acting as top electrode which collects the holes  though Ag is less commonly used as top electrode owing to its chemical sensitivity towards perovskite material  Recently  Nickel ( Ni ) and carbon have also been used as hole collector due to their improved stability as compared to the Ag and Au [ 36 ]  The most important architecture in PSCs is the mesoscopic structure with n–i–p configurations  Many high-efficiency solar cells implement this device configuration  The normal mesoscopic n–i–p architecture is shown in Fig  5a  This architecture consists of FTO acting as cathode  a thin compact layer of TiO2 ( thickness is about 50–70 nm ) acting as ETL  a mesoporous layer of metallic oxide ( normally TiO2 or Al2O3  150–300 nm thickness ) acting as scaffold for perovskite material  a perovskite absorber layer having thickness of about 300 nm  an HTL layer with thickness of 150–200 nm  and top electrode with the thickness of 50–100 nm ( normally Au or Ag )  Previously  the perovskite film used as light harvester in PSCs has the thickness of more than 500 nm  But  since the grain expansion of perovskite restricted in the structure pores  a considerable measure of the substance exists in amorphous phase [ 75 ]  resultant comparatively lower open-circuit voltage ( Voc ) and short-circuit current density ( Jsc ) [ 74 ]  However  by decreasing the thickness of mesoporous film to 150–200 nm remarkably enhanced the device efficiency because of improved crystallinity of perovskite film [ 24 ]  Further reducing the thickness below 150 nm results in poor Jsc and device performance  Yang et al  reported the PCE of 202 % with the mesoscopic structure consisting of perovskite nanocrystals in-built in the preceding ETM layer with the top uniform and compact perovskite layer [ 76 ]  The planar n–i–p architecture is demonstrated in Fig  5b  Now highly efficient PSCs can be fabricated without a mesoporous layer by careful supervision of growth of perovskite film  the perovskite interface  carrier transport films and electrodes [ 19 ]  Zhou et al  [ 19 ] fabricated the highly efficient planar n–i–p PSCs and reported the PCE of 193 % [ 19 ]  In the inverted architecture ( p–i–n ) the order in which the films are deposited is inversed in contrast to n–i–p architecture as shown in Fig  5c  In these types of PSCs  a 50–80 nm thick HTL is deposited first on the top of TCO  later on the intrinsic perovskite layer of 300 nm thickness is deposited on the top of HTL  followed by the deposition of ETL of about 10–60 nm thickness  Finally  the whole device stack is completed by the deposition of back contact of metal ( Au/Ag/Al )  Dong et al  first fabricated the planar p–i–n PSCs and attained PCE of 189 % [ 77 ]  With further progress in the p–i–n solar cells architecture  the specific contact substitutes have been extended from organic to inorganic matter [ 78  79 ]  7 Challenges Related with the PSCs and Their Potential Solutions There are certain challenges that are related to the PSCs  The challenges related to the PSCs and their possible solutions are discussed below  71 J-V Hysteresis The abnormal current-voltage hysteresis has been observed on PSCs  In J-V hysteresis  the efficiency of solar cells is anomalously dependent on the voltage scan rate and scan speed ( Fig  6a )  The three possible reasons for J-V hysteresis have been suggested by the researchers [ 80 ]  namely ferroelectricity ( Fig  6b ) [ 81 ]  ion migration ( Fig  6c ) [ 68 ]  [ 82 ]  and unbalance charge collection rates [ 83 ] ( Fig  6b )  Recently  a more consideration has been paid to the ferroelectric polarization of perovskite material as their ferroelectric properties may be critical in enhancing the power conversion efficiencies and stability [ 65 ]  Ferroelectricity influences the separation of photoexcited electrons and holes as well as recombination rate ( Fig  6b ) [ 84 ]  Simulations implied that the internal electric field pertaining to microscopic polarized regions produce hysteresis in the current-voltage features of perovskite devices because of alteration in the electron-hole reunion in the material volume [ 85 ]  According to Xia  et al  [ 86 ]  perovskite material shows strong ionic characters  and in the presence of electric field it gets polarized  Furthermore  a study based on impedance revealed that higher value of dielectric constant at lower frequencies is the cause of J-V hysteresis and this mainly arises due to the dipolar  ionic and electronic contributions [ 87 ]  Fig  6 figure 6 a J−V hysteresis shown for various scan rates and scan directions [ 82 ]  b Ferroelectric behaviour of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite [ 97 ]  c Schematic that depicts the effect of ion drifting in perovskite SCs [ 68 ]  d A considerable J − V hysteresis has been observed when the perovskite solar cell is cooled down to 175 K [ 98 ]  Figures are reproduced with permission from royal chemical society  ACS publications and nature publications under creative commons licence Full size image Snaith et al  proposed that the abnormal hysteresis may be due to the ferroelectric behaviour of the perovskite material owing to which material gets weakly polarized  capacitive effects  defects that are present on the surface of absorber [ 88 ]  Furthermore  in case of mesoporous architecture PSCs  the hysteresis strongly dependent on the crystal growth within mesoporous structure as well as thickness of mesoporous layer [ 88 ]  The J-V hysteresis is also dependent on the charge transport rate at perovskite/ETL and perovskite/HTL interface  The inverted p–i–n PSCs showed significant smaller hysteresis  likely because of uniform charge transport and passivation of perovskite/HTL or perovskite/ETL interface [ 81  89 ] ( Fig  6d )  The ferroelectric response of CH3NH3PbI3 has been probed by analysing the polarization electric field  though it was strongly affected by leakage current and hence can not be treated as an incontestable evidence to the electric response [ 81 ]  Kutes et al  for the first time demonstrated the existence of ferroelectric domain in high-quality CH3NH3PbI3 thin films fabricated by a solution processing method  They reported the size of the ferroelectric domains to be approximately to the size of the grains ( approximately 100 nm )  72 Long-Term Stability Another issue that is related to the PSCs is the long-term stability of these devices  A further progressive consideration is needed to understand the degradation mechanism  which is eventually necessary for the outdoor applications of PSCs  The reactivity of perovskite films towards water has been confirmed by the standard negative Gibbs Free energy for CH3NH3PbI3 degradation with humidity [ 90 ]  CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite undergoes hydrolysis in the presence of moisture due to its hygroscopic nature  The decomposition takes place through the following paths as given below ; ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) The reaction ( Eq  1 ) shows that CH3NH3+ is separated from the structure of perovskite and compound with the iodine to form aqueous CH3NH3Iand solid PbI2 salt  The CH3NH3I further decompose into aqueous methylamine and hydroiodic acid ( Eq  2 )  Furthermore  hydrogen iodide ( HI ) can undergo further decomposition to give water and I2 through a redox reaction due to the presence of oxygen ( Eq  3 )  The HI also undergoes photochemical reaction in the presence of UV light to form I2 and H2 gas  The perovskite degradation takes place even at lowest humidity level of 55 %  and film colour change from dark black to yellow is an indicator of this phenomenon [ 47 ]  Snaith et al  [ 91 ] fabricated the PSCs with enhanced thermal and moisture stability by replacing the organic HTL with single-walled carbon nanotubes ( SWCNTs )  The SWCNTs was modified with the insulating polymeric matrix [ 91 ]  The PSCs using this HTL showed improved thermal stability and performance as compared to the PSCs based on organic HTL  Mei et al  [ 60 ] reported the PSCs without using HTL and contain double film of mesoporous TiO2/ZrO2 scaffold  The contact layer of 10-micron thickness was a critical player in improving the resistance to water and the cell registered a certified PCE with stability over 1000 h in full sunlight and ambient air conditions  8 Conclusions This chapter has demonstrated the complete summary of gradual progress and limits in the field of PSCs  This chapter also summarized the basics of perovskite materials with a focus to explain their widespread applications in photovoltaics solar devices  We have also discussed the recent progress on the compositional engineering and interface features of perovskite layer and electric contacts  as these properties are critical to improve the power conversion efficiencies of PSCs  Such progressive bulk and interface engineered architecture will be favourable for increasing perovskite grain size and crystallinity  removing surface and bulk defects  refining film morphology and enhancing film uniformity  Interface engineering improved charge carrier dynamics across solar cell junction  charge extraction and transportation  and thus helps to enhance the device performance  Furthermore  the perovskite film deposition techniques such as solution processing  vapour deposition and vapour assisted solution processing have been discussed in detail  The perovskite film quality  crystallinity and uniformity are strongly dependent on the deposition method employed  The perovskite film morphology has been controlled by solvent engineering  hence been an important player in improving the PCE of PSCs  Moreover  the band-gap tuning of perovskite material has been discussed in detail  Finally  the problems that are associated with the perovskite solar cells such as J-V hysteresis have been demonstrated  These are the main factors that are preventing the further advancement of PSCs  The next major issue which has been identified is the long-term thermal and chemical stability of perovskite SCs  which requires to be focussed urgently to launch them in the market for outdoor photovoltaic applications  References Mor GK  Shankar K  Paulose M

versatility of perovskite barium titanate has been confirmed from various applications due to functionalizing  doping in line with applications as multilayer capacitors  PTC thermistors  electromechanical devices  piezoelectric transducers  actuators  dynamic RAM  high dielectrics as well as for electro-optic devices [ 1 ]  High purity sinterability is attracting major interest and is becoming vital during the synthesis of ultra-fine barium titanate  In most cases  solid-state milling along with ball milling is done with precursors to obtain barium titanate by solid-state processing [ 2 ]  Low purity and large and non-uniform sized particles are the features of the solid-state process  while suitable control or tuning of particle size  crystallinity and proper dispersion are associated with the wet chemical process [ 3 ]  Currently  focus is on miniaturization and integration of microelectronics  hence the physical size of the raw materials for ferroelectrics is a topic of research for enhanced performance  Techno-economical feasibility for nanocrystal production is important for the mass scale of operation [ 4 ]  Films of barium titanate are observed to be applicable for solar cells and various other optical properties for different applications [ 5 ]  Barium titanate is tetragonal perovskite at room temperature  It has a ferroelectric nature with high permittivity  and the phase transition ( Curie temperature ) from tetragonal to cubic paraelectric of the material is observed to be around 130 °C  Electrical insulation behaviour is observed for undoped titanate but higher temperatures of around 350 °C in the presence of reducing atmosphere causes oxygen deficiency  leading to conductivity in the sample [ 6 ]  Various routes like the sol-gel process [ 4 ]  conventional microwave hydrothermal processes [ 2 ]  mechanochemical routes [ 1  14  15 ]  oxalate [ 7 ]  alkoxide [ 8 ]  hydrolysis [ 9 ]  and hydrothermal  solid-state  co-precipitation processes [ 10 ] have been categorized for barium titanate synthesis  Thus  focus is on processing barium titanate with low cost precursors  using simple techniques for mass scale production  In the present article  agate-mortar milling activation followed by annealing is used to synthesize perovskite barium titanate  Annealing is carried at about 1300 °C for 4 h followed by phase analysis using XRD  Bond formations are verified from M-O coordinations of FTIR analysis  Morphological analyses are carried by FESEM and TEM  and the band gap is estimated for the synthesized samples  2  Experimental Modified solid-state milling was performed in a dry state in an agate mortar pestle with stoichiometric amounts of barium oxide ( BaO ) and titanium oxide ( TiO2 ) as precursors in a 1:1 molar ratio for 2 h to form the stoichometric perovskite  Barium titanate ( BT ) powder was formed after the mixed sample was sintered at 1300 °C for 4 h in normal atmosphere  The following heating rates of 6  5  4  and 3 K/min were used for thermal cycles from 0 to 600 °C  600 to 800 °C  800 to 1000 °C and 1000 to 1300 °C  respectively  while the normal cooling rate was provided  The equation for formation was given as BaO + TiO2 = BaTiO3  Characterizations of the synthesized samples were done to evaluate the phase  bonding and co-ordination of compounds  morphological features and optical properties  Phase analysis was carried out by an XRD ( Rigaku Ultima III ) with a wavelength of CuKα 154 Å  a current rating of 40 mA  a voltage of 50 kV within the scan range 2θ 10–80 ° and a scan rate of 5 °/min  FTIR analysis ( IR Prestige-21  Shimadzu ) identified the bond formation and M-O co-ordinations of the samples  Morphological analyses of the prepared samples were done with FESEM ( Hitachi  S-4800 ) and HRTEM ( JEOL  JEM 2100 ) operated at 200 kV  The optical properties were determined from UV-VIS spectral analysis followed by band gap evaluation  Band gap calculations were carried using a Tauc plot of the UV-VIS spectra ( Perkin Elmer  Lambda 35 )  3  Results and Discussion The phase analysis of the XRD pattern of the perovskite prepared at 1300 °C for 4 h is shown in Figure 1  The diffractogram pattern indicates peaks along the ( 100 )  ( 101 )  ( 111 )  ( 200 )  ( 201 )  ( 211 )  ( 202 ) and ( 301 ) planes  which are observed to be narrow in width with a high sharpness indicating the crystalline nature  Deconvulated or broad peaks and humps are not observed  The XRD images are found to be in correspondence with the JCPDS data card PDF # 812203  The growth of crystallites along preferred planes of orientation is feasible due to thermodynamic stability  No trace amount of precursors was observed in the XRD spectra  which indicates proper phase formation without any impurity or intermediate phases  The particle sizes of the prepared sample were calculated using Scherrer ’ s formula as t = 09 λ / ( β cosθ )  where t is the particle size  λ is the X-ray wavelength  β is the line broadening at half of the maximum intensity in radians and θ is the Bragg angle in degrees  Figure 1 figure 1 XRD patterns of barium titanate ( BT ) sintered at 1300 °C for 4 h ( ©S  Mukherjee ) Full size image The Scherrer equation was used to obtain the average particle size of barium titanate around 76 nm  Figure 2 shows the FTIR patterns of the synthesized barium titanate from the 400–4000 cm−1 range  A molecular vibration bond was observed to justify formation of chemical compounds  In Figure 2  BT has an absorption peak at 480–500 cm−1  700 cm−1 and doublet at 1000 cm−1  Some minor hump was observed at around 1500 and 880 cm−1  which is linked with carbonate peaks  This happens due to CO2 absorption from atmosphere [ 11 ]  A Ti-O bond or TiO4 tetrahedral band was observed to be around 632–700 cm−1 [ 12 ]  O-Ti-O stretching vibration of the TiO2 used as precursor was also observed  possibly at around 470 cm−1 [ 13 ]  The above M-O absorption peaks and M-O bonds indicate formation of perovskite barium titanate  justifying the XRD analysis  Figure 2 figure 2 FTIR spectra of synthesized barium titanate after heat treatment at 1300 °C for 4 h ( ©S  Mukherjee ) Full size image FESEM micrography of barium titanate at 1300 °C for 4 h is shown in Figure 3  For all cases  agglomeration was observed with few interconnected pores  The growth of particulates and agglomerates is homogenous in nature  Agglomerates have a polygonal  bimodal shape morphology  while individual particulates have regular to irregular shapes  In some portions  particulates have a conchoidal fracture similar to the hexagonal shape at top faces  Interlocking is observed along the faces of such particulates  leading to agglomeration  Such agglomeration indicates a low surface area of perovskite titanates  making them unfeasible for catalytic actions  However  agglomeration promotes better optical and electrical properties  Agglomeration is around 400 nm while individual particulates are around 50–100 nm  Figure 3 figure 3 FESEM micrographs of barium titanate ( BT ) sintered at 1300 °C for 4 h ( ©S  Mukherjee ) Full size image The TEM analysis is shown in Figure 4  It was carried out with samples dispersed on carbon-coated copper grids after ultrasonication in ethanol  The more highly magnified image clearly indicates agglomeration as observed in FESEM  Agglomerated forms are regular to irregular polygonal shapes with a size estimated to be around 450 nm  while individual particulates are about 80 nm  Thus  both FESEM and TEM analyses are observed to be in correspondence with each other  The TEM analysis confers the perovskite as nanocrystalline  as observed from the XRD spectral analysis using Scherrer ’ s formula for crystallite size estimation  The band gap of the perovskite barium titanate ( both direct and indirect ) was estimated using a Tauc plot after annealing at 1300 °C for 4 h  as shown in Figure 5  Figure 4 figure 4 Typical TEM images of barium titanate ( BT ) sintered at 1300 °C for 4 h ( ©S  Mukherjee ) Full size image Figure 5 figure 5 Direct and indirect band gap of barium titanate by a Tauc plot at 1300 °C for 4 h ( ©S  Mukherjee ) Full size image The absorption mode of the UV-VIS spectral analysis was within a scan range of 200–850 nm  Samples were prepared by dispersion of the powders with ultrasonicators for 2 h in an alcohol medium for optical analysis  The Tauc relation ( αhν ) n = C ( hν -Eg ) was used  where n = 2  for the direct allowed transition  n = 1/2 for indirect allowed transition within the band structure  Extrapolation of the tangent of the curve to the x-axis gave the value of the band gap of the sample  Direct and indirect band gap values of the synthesized samRoom-Temperature Sputtered SnO2 as Robust Electron Transport Layer for Air-Stable and Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells on Rigid and

have aroused enormous interest from both academic research and photovoltaic ( PV ) industry  In order to bring PSC technology from laboratory to market  material stability  device flexibility  and scalability are important issues to address for vast production  Nevertheless  PSCs are still primarily prepared by solution methods which limit film scalability  while high-temperature processing of metal oxide electron transport layer ( ETL ) makes PSCs costly and incompatible with flexible substrates  Here  we demonstrate rarely-reported room-temperature radio frequency ( RF ) sputtered SnO2 as a promising ETL with suitable band structure  high transmittance  and excellent stability to replace its solution-processed counterpart  Power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of 1282 % and 588 % have been achieved on rigid glass substrate and flexible PEN substrate respectively  The former device retained 93 % of its initial PCE after 192-hour exposure in dry air while the latter device maintained over 90 % of its initial PCE after 100 consecutive bending cycles  The result is a solid stepping stone toward future PSC all-vapor-deposition fabrication which is being widely used in the PV industry

flexible substrates Article Open access 11 January 2016 Introduction Perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) as a promising and emerging photovoltaic ( PV ) technology have quickly caught enormous attention in both academic research and PV industry over the past few years  As one of the most intensively researched types of solar cells  PSCs have been rapidly developed with unprecedented success  leading to a significant improvement on power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) from 38 % to certified 227 % within a decade12  Besides high device performance  low fabrication cost as well as tunable composition and bandgap give this group of semiconductors gigantic potential and intriguing optoelectronic properties for next-generation solar cell3  Crystal growth optimization  interfacial engineering  compositional optimization  and device architecture design have been further explored to enhance PCE and stability of devices and eventually make them competitive with conventional silicon and other leading thin film solar cell technologies45678  Typically  a PSC consists of an electron transport layer ( ETL )  a perovskite film and a hole transport layer ( HTL )  in addition to top and bottom electrical contacts  Particularly  inorganic metal-oxide films  such as TiO2 and ZnO  have been widely reported as effective ETLs for high-performance PSCs91011121314  Nevertheless  they both have major drawbacks  TiO2 as the most commonly used ETL has low electron mobility and requires sintering at high temperature up to 500 °C1516171819  High temperature processing not only increases the cost of device fabrication  but also restricts the compatibility with flexible substrates  In addition  TiO2 provokes perovskite degradation under exposure of UV illumination which is problematic during the prolonged device operation20  On the other hand  the hygroscopic nature of ZnO easily causes perovskite decomposition in moisture environment  Moreover  ZnO has poor thermal stability so it can easily react with perovskite during annealing and thermal treatment at elevated temperature  which eventually stimulates undesired perovskite degradation or even decomposition  Like perovskite  TiO2 and ZnO are mostly prepared by solution methods  which sacrifice film uniformity and limit large-scale device production  On the other hand  SnO2 is regarded as an alternative to replace TiO2 and ZnO as an effective ETL to achieve low-cost PSCs with improved stability2122  SnO2 has a wider bandgap and its electron mobility is two orders of magnitude higher than that of TiO2  making it a more suitable candidate for use in high performance devices23  Compare to TiO2 and ZnO  SnO2 is less hygroscopic in nature  has better thermal and UV stability  and possesses lower photocatalytic activity24  These properties prevent perovskite degradation and benefit PSC long-term stability  Despite that high-performance PSCs based on SnO2 have been achieved  almost all reported SnO2 films were prepared by spin-coating252627282930  atomic layer deposition ( ALD ) 3132  plasma-enhanced ALD33  sol-gel process34  chemical bath deposition35  hydrothermal process36  and electrodeposition37  In fact  many of these methods involve high-temperature processing and annealing ranging from 100 °C up to 550 °C  which again increases fabrication complexity and cost and makes it incompatible with flexible substrates  In order to make PSC technology cost-effective in the future  a fabrication technique allowing vast production is absolutely necessary  Considering the high reliability  maturity  and capability for large-scale production of sputtering technique in both industries and laboratories  SnO2 prepared by magnetron sputtering for PSC application is however rarely reported38  And previously studied sputtered SnO2 film was calibrated based on deposition time instead of thickness  which is a more accurate and reliable approach in principle since deposition time depends on a number of deposition parameters and equipment infrastructure  Moreover  previous study lacked investigation on device stability as well as thorough thin film characterization on their SnO2 and the corresponding glovebox-processed spin-coated perovskite absorber  particularly morphology and crystallinity analysis by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM )  X-ray diffraction ( XRD )  and photoluminescence ( PL )  Therefore  it was hard to convince the effectiveness and compatibility of sputtered SnO2 with perovskite solar cells  On the other hand  perovskite films are typically prepared by solution methods inside a glovebox filled with inert gas  Similarly  those solution methods limit film scalability while the use of glovebox increases production cost and complexity  Researchers have therefore put a great amount of effort to fabricate perovskite films and devices in ambient condition without sacrificing film quality  device performance  as well as stability1939  Here  we demonstrate room-temperature RF sputtered SnO2 film as an effective and robust ETL and meanwhile take one step forward to implement it together with vapor-deposited perovskite absorber for air-stable and efficient PSCs on both rigid and flexible substrates  By this application  we are now only one step away from sputtered SnO2 based all-vacuum-deposited perovskite solar cells which will eventually enable industrialization  To the best of our knowledge  there is no report of using sputtered SnO2 for flexible PSCs application  Both SnO2 thickness and deposition conditions including working pressure and gas environment were systematically investigated  Device stability and hysteresis were also carefully studied  Results and Discussion In this work  we demonstrated n-i-p planar structure of PSCs with optimized room-temperature-processed SnO2 as ETL prepared by RF magnetron sputtering and vacuum-deposited perovskite film  Figure 1a shows the schematic of device structure of our PSCs : ITO-PEN/SnO2/MAPbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au  Figure 1b  c display SEM images of complete device based on rigid FTO glass substrate and flexible ITO-PEN substrate respectively  The morphology and surface roughness of bare FTO ( Supplementary Fig  S1 )  40 nm SnO2-coated FTO ( Fig  2a  b )  and solution-processed SnO2 ( Fig  2c  d ) were studied by SEM and atomic force microscopy ( AFM )  Supplementary AFM reveals the root-mean-square ( RMS ) roughness and mean roughness of bare FTO glass were 7736 nm and 6096 nm respectively  In contrast  40 nm SnO2-coated FTO had a RMS roughness and mean roughness of 5488 nm and 4358 nm respectively  while solution-processed SnO2 had higher RMS roughness and mean roughness of 6439 nm and 5000 nm  It is reflected that sputtered SnO2 film was uniformly deposited on FTO surface and SnO2 grains were small enough to fill in the gaps between FTO grains  leading to a lower surface roughness than solution-processed SnO2  which is beneficial for the growth of vapor-deposited perovskite  To illustrate how surface roughness matters  perovskite was vapor-deposited on a 10 nm SnO2-coated FTO with RMS roughness and mean roughness of 7199 nm and 5708 nm respectively  measured by AFM ( Supplementary Fig  S2 )  It was clear that perovskite grain sizes on the 10 nm SnO2-coated FTO were significantly reduced ( Supplementary Fig  S3a )  Moreover  cross-sectional SEM shown in Supplementary Fig  S3b reveals that the perovskite grains and shape became more irregular on 10 nm SnO2-coated FTO  while single-crystal-thick perovskite grains with larger grain sizes and regular shapes were crystallized on 40 nm SnO2-coated FTO ( Supplementary Fig  S3c  d )  In addition  small perovskite grains tended to crystallize in the perovskite-SnO2 interface on 10 nm SnO2-coated FTO  which could adversely affect the efficiency of carrier transport  Since materials were slowly deposited onto substrate down to a few angstroms per second  a rougher surface would hinder the ion migration and volumetric expansion as perovskite crystallization took place  In contrast  this problem becomes less significant when perovskite is prepared by solution methods because they allow ions within the precursors to easily spread all over the substrates without overcoming significant energy barriers  Therefore  this problem was not commonly discussed in depth before  In contrast  although perovskite grown on solution-processed SnO2 film ( Supplementary Fig  S4 ) demonstrated comparable grain size with those grown on sputtered SnO2  the former perovskite films exhibit layered structure on most of the grains  This could be attributed to the higher roughness of solution-processed SnO2 film  leading to inconsistent rate and degree of perovskite crystallization and ultimately high surface roughness  These could increase the probability of carrier recombination between perovskite absorber and the HTL  Figure 1 figure 1 Device

Supplementary Fig  S5a  The sputtered SnO2 film showed a secondary cutoff edge of 501 eV ( Supplementary Fig  S5b )  indicating a work function WS of 501 eV  Supplementary Fig  S5c shows the valence band maximum ( VBM ) of the sputtered SnO2 film is located at 307 eV  below EF  The bandgap of the sputtered SnO2 film acquired from the Tauc plot ( Fig  3a ) was 372 eV  which is wider than that of ZnO and TiO2  A wider bandgap implies better hole blocking ability and can avoid absorption of high-energy photons which leads to small current loss40  Based on the above values  it can be calculated using the semiconductor band structure ( EC = WS + VBM − Eg ) that the EC of the sputtered SnO2 film was 436 eV  which is deeper than that of TiO2 and ZnO  both are 42 eV  The deeper conduction band of SnO2 compared to TiO2 and ZnO could enhance electron transfer from perovskite to the ETL  On the other hand  calculation showed EV of the sputtered SnO2 film was 808 eV  which is much deeper than that of TiO2 and ZnO  74 eV and 76 eV respectively  The deeper valence band of SnO2 can enhance hole blocking ability from perovskite to the ETL  Figure 3b shows the energy band diagram of each device

) of various device components  ( c ) XRD and ( d ) transmittance spectra of sputtered SnO2 and spin-coated SnO2 films deposited on FTO glass  Full size image Being an effective ETL for PSCs of n-i-p planar structure  transmittance  thickness  and film quality are crucial  XRD ( Fig  3c ) revealed that both sputtered and solution-processed SnO2 films were polycrystalline but the former one exhibited better crystallinity  All XRD peaks for SnO2 were indexable to the tetragonal SnO2 structure  indicating the formation of pure SnO2 crystals  In addition  sputtered SnO2 film on FTO glass showed good transparency with transmittance close to 90 % in the visible region ( Fig  3d )  while solution-processed SnO2 had lower transmittance of about 80 %  It is noteworthy the room-temperature sputtered SnO2 here demonstrated even higher transmittance than other high-temperature-processed spin-coated SnO2 films41  To obtain high-quality SnO2 films  impact of thickness  sputtering working pressure  and the flow rates of O2 and Ar during sputtering were systematically studied  Since the thickness of ETL can critically affect cell performance  SnO2 film was first sputtered under the same sputtering power of 60 W on FTO glass substrates kept at room temperature with four different thicknesses  20 nm  40 nm  60 nm  and 80 nm  which took 8 min  15 min  23 min  and 30 min for sputtering  respectively  It can be inferred that the deposition rate was approximately 043 Å s−1  After sputtering  SnO2-coated FTO substrates were transferred to the evaporator for perovskite fabrication via a two-step vapor deposition as described in the Method section  The as-deposited perovskite samples were annealed in ambient air condition with over 65 % humidity  It has been reported that certain level moisture is helpful for perovskite crystallization but excessive moisture could be detrimental to perovskite42  To overcome the humidity problem  perovskite samples were annealed for a short period of time at elevated temperature to accelerate the perovskite crystallization process and meanwhile minimize perovskite film degradation in ambient condition394344  As-deposited perovskite samples were annealed at 130 °C for 10 min instead of the conventional 100 °C for an hour  It turned out that this method is also workable for vapor-deposited perovskite films  not only for solution-processed perovskite films  The UV-vis absorption spectra shown in Fig  4a of the vapor-deposited perovskite shows good absorption in the visible region  It also revealed that perovskite grown on sputtered SnO2 exhibited higher absorption than that grown on solution-processed SnO2  which was attributed to its lower transmittance than sputtered SnO2  The absorption onset corresponded to an optical bandgap of 157 eV  estimated from the Tauc plot ( Supplementary Fig  S6 )  The estimation matches well with the perovskite PL peak at 788 nm and the steady PL showed a more significant quench when depositing the perovskite film on sputtered SnO2 compared to solution-processed SnO2 ( Fig  4b )  It supports that sputtered SnO2 possessed more efficient electron transport ability  XRD of perovskite ( Fig  4c ) presented the expected perovskite pattern  with intense signals at 141°  284°  and 319° corresponding to the ( 100 )  ( 200 )  and ( 310 ) directions  respectively  It showed an extra peak of PbI2 at 127° for perovskite that underwent 30 min prolonged annealing in humid air condition  Supplementary Fig  S7 shows the SEM of perovskite annealed for 30 min  The perovskite decomposing into PbI2 hindered its crystallization by grain boundary expansion and grain cracking  As a consequence  the intensity of each perovskite peak was clearly reduced as shown in Fig  4c  It confirms the effectiveness of short-time annealing processing at elevated temperature in ambient condition  Figure 4 figure 4 Properties of vapor-deposited perovskite film  ( a ) Ultraviolet-visible

under AM15G illumination are shown in Fig  5a  The device performance firstly increased and then decreased as the sputtered SnO2 thickness increased  It is seen that devices with 40 nm SnO2 yielded the best performance  with a PCE of 1114 %  a VOC of 0934 V  a JSC of 2291 mAcm−2  and a fill factor ( FF ) of 521 %  so 40 nm was taken as the optimum thickness  If the SnO2 layer was too thin  it could not fully cover the FTO surface for effective electron transport  On the other hand  a too thick SnO2 layer would induce a larger series resistance  Figure 5 figure 5 Device performance of

) solution-processed SnO2 measured under reverse and forward voltage scanning with AM15G illumination  ( f ) EQE curves of the champion devices based on sputtered and solution-processed SnO2 respectively  Full size image The sputtering working pressure is another critical factor to determine the sputtered film quality  We fabricated PSCs based on 40 nm SnO2 sputtered under the same power of 60 W but three different working pressures  025 Pa  05 Pa  and 10 Pa  The J-V characteristics of respective devices are shown in Fig  5b  The device performance  particularly the VOC  decreased as working pressure increased  It is seen that devices with SnO2 sputtered at 025 Pa yielded the best performance  with a PCE of 1218 %  a VOC of 0948 V  a JSC of 2234 mAcm−2  and an FF of 575 %  so 025 Pa was taken as the optimum working pressure  An optimum working pressure is important so that the mean free path of gas molecules ( O2 and Ar ) is comparable to the distance between the target and substrates  A high working pressure will reduce the mean free path of molecules  In other words  there will be so much scattering that electrons will not have enough time to gather enough energy between collisions to ionize the atoms on the target  As a result  it causes a less uniform film deposition over the substrates  The reduced VOC is attributed to uneven deposition due to too high working pressure  Sputtering under working pressure below 025 Pa was attempted  however  the plasma became unsustainable and unstable around 02 Pa due to too low gas molecule concentration  In order to yield a self-sustaining plasma  each electron has to generate enough secondary emission  Therefore  025 Pa was concluded to be the optimum working pressure for SnO2 sputtering without compromising film quality and device performance  The impact of flow rate of O2 and Ar during SnO2 sputtering on device performance was also studied  The flow rate of Ar was kept constant at 50 sccm while the flow rate of O2 was varied from 1 sccm  5 sccm  to 10 sccm ( defined as FR1:50  FR5:50  and FR10:50 respectively )  Figure 5c shows the J-V characteristics of PSCs with 40 nm SnO2 sputtered under the same working pressure of 025 Pa but different flow rates of O2 and Ar  The FR5:50 ( O2 : Ar ) PSC showed a PCE of 1282 % with VOC of 0965 V  JSC of 2291 mAcm−2  and FF of 580 %  Its performance was slightly better that of the FR10:50 PSC  However  the FR1:50 PSC yielded the poorest performance : a PCE of 866 % with VOC of 0938 V  JSC of 1997 mAcm−2  and FF of 462 %  A possible reason is that too low oxygen flow rate ( or partial pressure ) does not favor stoichiometric SnO2 sputtering  The fewer O2 amount was not sufficient to compensate and combine with the tin ions sputtered out of the target to form high-quality SnO2 film and hence worsened the hole blocking ability  The performance of devices using SnO2 ETLs with different parameters are summarized in Table 1  Table 1 Device performance of devices based on different sputtering parameters of SnO2  Full size table Figure 5d shows the J-V characteristics of the champion PSC using 40 nm SnO2 sputtered under optimized working pressure of 025 Pa and 5:50 O2 : Ar ratio measured under reverse and forward scanning  It achieved a PCE of 1282 % with a VOC of 0965 V  a JSC of 2291 mAcm−2  and an FF of 580 % when measured under reverse voltage scanning and a PCE of 1206 % with a VOC of 0931 V  a JSC of 2263 mAcm−2  and an FF of 572 % when measured under forward voltage scanning  Therefore  the device exhibits a small hysteresis  In comparison  Fig  5e shows the J-V characteristics of the champion PSC based on solution-processed SnO2  It achieved a lower PCE of 1078 % with a VOC of 0901 V  a JSC of 2175 mAcm−2  and an FF of 549 % when measured under reverse voltage scanning and a lower PCE of 958 % with a VOC of 0891 V  a JSC of 2154 mAcm−2  and an FF of 499 % when measured under forward voltage scanning  It exhibited a more significant hysteresis  The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of both champion devices are shown in Fig  5f  To investigate the stability  both champion devices were left in room-temperature dry air with 30 % humidity in dark for 192 hours  The PCE of each device was measured every 24 hours  It is found after 192 hours that the sputtered SnO2 based champion device could retain over 93 % of its initial PCE while the solution-processed SnO2 based champion device could only retain 77 % of its initial PCE  Supplementary Fig  S8 shows the J-V characteristics of both devices measured after 192 hours of stability test  The PCE of the sputtered SnO2 based device dropped to 1191 % with a VOC of 0929 V  a JSC of 2199 mAcm−2  and an FF of 583 % while the PCE of the solution-processed SnO2 based device dropped to 834 % with a VOC of 0853 V  a JSC of 1975 mAcm−2  and an FF of 495 %  Supplementary Fig  S9a shows the evolution of their PCEs throughout the monitored period  The performance loss can be attributed to the degradation of the perovskite film within an unencapsulated device in 65 % humidity  The highly hygroscopic and deliquescent properties of Li-TFSI used as dopant in Spiro-OMeTAD can also be regarded as a contribution to perovskite degradation due to penetration of water molecules45  In addition  the perovskite film could deteriorate rapidly in the presence of TBP as a polar solvent  Therefore  TBP may be a good solvent for perovskite  which means it can corrode the perovskite layer46  It is worth mentioning that the perovskite films  HTL films  and all devices were annealed  prepared  unencapsulated  and characterized in ambient condition with humidity greater than 65 %  It convinces the viability of air processability of perovskite films  HTL films  and device characterization without the use of a glove box  To further illustrate this assertion  40 sputtered SnO2 based PSCs in one single batch using the optimized SnO2 parameters and 40 solution-processed SnO2 based PSCs in one batch were fabricated by the same procedures  Statistics as shown in Supplementary Fig  S9b convince the reproducibility and consistency of device performance  Both batches of devices demonstrated normal distribution of PCEs  It can be concluded that sputtered SnO2 based devices showed higher average PCE and sputtered SnO2 is therefore more effective and beneficial to enhance PSC device performance and stability  Flexibility is a desirable feature of thin film solar cells for a variety of applications  such as portable power sources  building-integrated photovoltaics  clothing and textiles  power-generating fabrics  and electronics with light-weight curved surface  One of the main advantages in the use of sputtered SnO2 is that no sintering or annealing step is required thus flexible plastic substrates can be used  The other major fabrication steps ( vapor deposition of perovskite  spin-coating of Spiro-OMeTAD  and thermal evaporation of Au ) are also carried out in room temperature condition  which means this fabrication process as a whole is compatible with flexible substrates  To date  majority of the reported flexible PSCs employ spin-coated TiO2  ZnO  or PCBM as ETL4748495051  while very few of them used solution-processed SnO2 as ETL  To illustrate the compatibility of sputtered SnO2 with flexible substrates for perovskite photovoltaic  in our work rigid FTO glass substrate was therefore replaced by flexible substrate  namely indium-doped-tin-oxide-coated polyethylene naphthalate ( ITO-PEN ) ( Fig  6a )  Supplementary Fig  S10a shows the XRD spectrum of vapor-deposited perovskite grown on flexible ITO-PEN  It presented an expected perovskite spectrum with sharp signal intensities and without PbI2 residue  showing that vapor deposition and post-annealing treatment of perovskite on flexible substrates did not induce any perovskite degradation  20 devices were fabricated using the same preparation procedures and their PCE distribution is summarized in Supplementary Fig  S10b  Figure 6b shows the J-V characteristics of the champion device on flexible ITO substrate  It yielded a PCE of 588 % with a VOC of 0932 V  a JSC of 891 mAcm−2  and an FF of 708 % when measured under reverse voltage scanning and a PCE of 548 % with a VOC of 0898 V  a JSC of 871 mAcm−2  and an FF of 701 % when measured under forward voltage scanning  Therefore  the device exhibits a small hysteresis  The discrepancies between JSC ’ s appeared in the studied devices measured under reverse and forward scannings might be the result of slow response of photocurrent and higher defect density52  It has been confirmed that higher defect density significantly contributes to the J-V hysteresis and degradation of photovoltaic parameters5253  In comparison with the champion device based on rigid FTO glass substrate  the flexible devices yielded a substantial loss in JSC but a significant improvement in FF  The loss of JSC could be accounted to the lower transmittance through ITO-PEN substrates compared to FTO glass substrates and the threefold increase in device area from 314 mm2 to 10 mm2  On the other hand  the improvement in FF could be caused by the smoother ITO electrode surface  allowing flatter coverage of SnO2 film and eventually more compact interface between SnO2 film and perovskite for even more effective electron extraction and reduced series resistance  Figure 6 figure 6 Photograph and device performance of a perovskite solar cell prepared on a flexible PEN

highest radius of curvature to the lowest  The linear fit is provided as a guide to the eye  ( d ) Normalized PCE of a flexible PSC as a function of bending cycles at a radius of 2 cm  Full size image Mechanical flexibility of devices under bending stress is of great importance concerning flexible and/or wearable device applications  Bending tests showed how well the device performance retained after being bent repeatedly to decreasing radii of curvature  The identical flexible PSC was bent by mechanical force with 10 different radii of curvature in one bending cycle  After each round of bending  the device performance was measured repetitively  The impact of bending on device PCE is presented in Fig  6c  Less than 12 % drop in PCE was observed  This result indicated sputtered SnO2 film is an effective and robust ETL for flexible PSC application  The impact of mechanical bending via multiple cycles of bending test was further evaluated  A total of 100 consecutive bending cycles at radius of 2 cm were performed  As shown in Fig  6d  the device sustained over 90 % of its initial PCE  After the bending test  VOC  JSC  and FF of the flexible device respectively dropped from 0930 V to 0929 V  from 876 mAcm−2 to 872 mAcm−2  and from 714 % to 703 %  Consequently  the PCE reduced from 582 % to 569 %  Although the flexible devices based on sputtered SnO2 demonstrated lower PCE than devices based on TiO2  ZnO  and PCBM  this is a pioneering work proving that sputtered SnO2 is effective and robust on both rigid and flexible substrates for perovskite photovoltaics  Sputtering technique is desirable for upscaling device area with uniform film deposition while flexible devices are especially attractive for a variety of consumer-driven products  Conclusion We have pioneered the optimization and implementation of radio frequency magnetron sputtered SnO2 as electron transport layer for vapor-deposited-MAPbI3-based perovskite solar cells on both rigid and flexible substrates  It was demonstrated that neither mesoporous scaffold nor any high-temperature processing procedures were required to achieve efficient and air-stable devices without the use of a glove box  It is noteworthy that in the current device structure there was no backside passivation and all devices were not packaged  so the entire fabrication and characterization processes were subject to ambient condition of humidity greater than 65 %  Despite the air processing in humid environment and perovskite annealing on flexible substrates  PSCs of 1282 % PCE on rigid glass substrates and 588 % PCE on flexible substrates were achieved  We have also shown that the viability and repeatability of acquiring high-quality vapor-deposited perovskite films with large grain sizes and smooth morphology on sputtered SnO2 film via short-time annealing at elevated temperature processing in ambient condition  proving its compatibility with vapor-deposited perovskite films  More importantly  sputtered SnO2 based devices were demonstrated to have better device photovoltaic performance and stability than solution-processed SnO2 based devices  Such successful implementation of robust sputtered SnO2 films on flexible devices could serve as a promising route for future development and application of sputtered SnO2 film into large-scale cost-effective all-vacuum-deposited flexible

temperature  The clean substrates were transferred to a vacuum chamber and evacuated to a pressure of 4 × 10−4 Pa for SnO2 sputtering  The substrates were mounted on a rotating platform  10 cm above the SnO2 target ( China Rare Metal Co Ltd )  The sputtering atmosphere was consisted of O2 and Ar  When 4 × 10−4 Pa was reached  O2 ( 9999 % ) and Ar ( 9999 % ) were pumped into the chamber  The gas flow rates of O2 and Ar were controlled by gas-flow meters and the gas flow ratio of O2 and Ar was set 1 sccm and 50 sccm  5 sccm and 50 sccm  or 10 sccm and 50 sccm respectively  The working pressure

Scanning probe microscopy ( NanoScope III ) ( Digital Instruments ) was used to characterize the surface roughness of filmsple were estimated to be around 338 and 3 eV  respectively  Hence  the perovskite sample prepared by solid-state mixing is observed to be active for energy transition ( electron transfer within the band structure ) in the UV-near visible region  Thus  the synthesized material has possibilities for catalytic applications in the UV-near visible spectrum  Moreover  the band gap values are comparable with other perovskites like transitional metal doped barium titanate

solar cells ( PSCs ) are developing rapidly  but most of the PSCs are prepared by spin coating process  which is not compatible with potential large-scale  high-throughput industrialization  Slot-die coating is a promising deposition technique with high precision and excellent material utilization  which can accelerate the industrial-scale production of PSCs and enhance the potential commercial

Cells Article 10 February 2024 1 Introduction Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) have developed rapidly over the decade  and the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) is comparable to that of silicon solar cells  which is attributed to the excellent properties of perovskite materials  including decent light absorbing ability [ 1  2 ]  high electron and hole mobility [ 3 ]  and excellent photovoltaic properties such as small exciton binding energy [ 4 ]  Besides  one of the important advantages of PSCs is that perovskite films can be continuously processed via solution printing techniques [ 567 ]  which are suitable for large-scale industrial production  Currently  the PCE of PSCs has increased from the first reported 38 % to 252 % [ 8  9 ]  However  most of the highly efficient PSCs are prepared by spin coating  Although the spin coating method has its own advantages such as high operability and good reproducibility  it is not suitable for the preparation of PSCs in large scale  Apart from that  spin-coated devices are generally fabricated in glove boxes  which hampers the preparation of large-area modules of PSCs  Thus  many researchers are looking for an appropriate printing method to solve the problem above  There are several printing methods nowadays  including doctor blading [ 101112 ]  spraying printing [ 131415 ]  screen printing [ 161718 ]  slot-die coating [ 19202122 ]  roll-to-roll ( R2R ) printing [ 20  2324252627 ]  etc  Among these methodologies  slot-die coating is one of the most promising methods to realize the industrialization of PSCs  It is because that the coating speed and the flow rate of precursor solution can be precisely controlled to manipulate the thickness of perovskite films  It also helps to accurately predict the required amount of precursor solution and prevent the waste of raw materials  More importantly  the slot-die coating is compatible with the R2R process  which has an important significance for industrial production  For instance  Vak and co-workers adopted one-step slot-die coating to prepare planar PSCs with a PCE of 127 % [ 19 ]  With additive engineering ( CH3NH3I )  they further fabricated fully slot-die-coated PSCs and achieved a PCE of 144 % on glass via a batch process and a PCE of 11 % on a flexible substrate via R2R process [ 28 ]  To date  the PCEs of PSCs with only slot-die-coated perovskite films based on two-step and one-step deposition are up to 183 % and 18 %  respectively [ 29  30 ]  However  there are still some challenges for printed PSCs  The moisture in ambient air can seriously affect the growth of perovskite films  which has a fatal effect on device performance [ 313233 ]  In previous studies [ 26  34 ]  mixed solvent and a small quality of additives were added to the perovskite precursor solution to enhance hydrophobicity or prolong the crystallization process of perovskite film  It can effectively inhibit the influence of humidity on the perovskite film  so as to form a dense and pinhole-free perovskite film  In addition  a heated substrate and inert gas blowing methods are widely employed to protect the perovskite film from moisture during the fabrication process  leading to dense and uniform perovskite films as well [ 20  33  35 ]  In this study  planar heterojunction PSCs were obtained by homemade slot-die coater under ambient conditions ( humidity ~ 40 % ) through sequential deposition process  During the slot-die coating processes  the substrate temperature was maintained through in situ heating  which is important to achieve a uniform film  Besides  the mixed solvent and additives were used to enhance the quality of perovskite films  The fully slot-die-coated PSCs with a structure of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag yielded a champion PCE of 1455 % and a stabilized output of 1425 %  The results suggest that efficient PSCs with good repeatability could be processed via fully slot-die coating in ambient condition  which would be matchable with potentially large-scale  roll-to-roll commercial process  2 Experimental section 21 Preparation of solutions All materials are purchased without any purification prior to use  The electron transport layer ( ETL ) SnO2 precursor solution ( 15 % in H2O colloidal dispersion ) was diluted to 1 % with deionized water  For the PbI2 precursor solution  372 mg ( 07 M )  462 mg ( 1 M )  5993 mg ( 13 M ) of PbI2 were dissolved in 1 ml of N  N-dimethylformamide ( DMF ) solvent  respectively  462 mg ( 1 M ) of PbI2 without additives and 462 mg ( 1 M ) of PbI2 with additives are dissolved in 1 ml of DMF and dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) ( volume ratio 9:1 ) blended solvent  respectively  The additives include cesium iodide ( CsI )  formamidinium iodide ( HC ( NH2 ) 2I  FAI )  methylammonium bromide ( CH3NH3Br  MABr ) and methylammonium chloride ( CH3NH3Cl  MACl ) with a ratio of 27 mg : 23 mg : 23 mg : 23 mg All the PbI2 precursor solutions were stirred on a hotplate at 75 °C for 8 h and then slot-die coated as the first layer  Subsequently  the FAI/MABr/MACl mixture solution ( 46 mg : 46 mg : 46 mg in 1 ml isopropanol ) was stirred at room temperature and deposited by slot-die coating  For the hole transport layer ( HTL )  90 mg/ml Spiro-OMeTAD was dissolved in chlorobenzene ( CB ) solution  and 45 μL of lithium bis ( trifluoromethanesulfonyl ) imide ( Li-TFSI ) in an acetonitrile solution ( 170 mg/ml ) and 10 μL4-tert-butylpyriine ( 4-TBP ) were added as additive  22 Device fabrication The indium tin oxide ( ITO ) glass ( ∼5 Ωsq−1  10 × 10 cm2 ) was ultrasonically cleaned in acetone  detergent/deionized water  isopropanol for 20 min  respectively  and then dried by nitrogen flow and irradiated with ultraviolet ozone for 25 min  The SnO2 hydrosol diluted with deionized water was deposited by slot-die coating at a coating speed of 20 mm/s  an ink injection speed of 005 ml/min  a distance of 30 μm between coating head and substrate  a substrate temperature of 60 °C and then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min  The PbI2 precursor solution was printed at a coating speed of 20 mm/s  an ink injection speed of 005 ml/min  a distance of 40 μm between coating head and substrate  a substrate temperature of 70 °C and then annealed at 75 °C for 30 min  After the PbI2 film was cooled  a mixed solution of FAI/MABr/MACl was printed at a coating speed of 10 mm/s  an ink injection rate of 02 ml/min  a substrate temperature of 60 °C  a gap of 76 μm between coating head and substrate and then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min  Then  the Spiro-OMeTAD solvent was printed on perovskite films at a coating speed of 20 mm/s  an ink injection speed of 005 ml/min  a gap between the coating head and the substrate of 30 μm  a substrate temperature of 60 °C  Finally  a 100-nm silver electrode was obtained by evaporation at a pressure of 8 × 10–6 mbar  23 Characterization The PSCs were fabricated by a platform slot-die coating apparatus ( nanoupe-s300 )  Dektak XT stylus profiler was utilized to measure the thickness of the films  UV–visible spectrophotometer ( Puxi  T9  China ) was used to characterize the absorption characteristics of perovskite films  X-ray diffraction ( XRD  Rigaku D  Max 2500  Japan ) was employed to characterize the crystallographic properties of perovskites  A scanning electron microscopy ( Fei Helios Nanolab 600i SEM  America ) was used to characterize the surface morphology of the perovskite film  The J–V characteristic curve of the device was measured by a digital source meter ( Keithley  model 2420 )  The measurement range was from −02 to 12 V with the delay time of 50 ms 60 data points were taken  and the measurement state was performed under the Xenon lamp-based solar simulator ( Newport91160s  AM15G )  The solar simulator with a light intensity of 100 mW/cm2 was calibrated by a standard silicon solar cell before J–V measurements  3 Results and discussion The device structure in this work is ITO/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag  Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of slot-die-coated PSCs  in which SnO2  perovskite and Spiro-OMeTAD are slot-die coated via layer by layer and the Ag electrode is deposited via evaporation subsequently  It is noted that the slot-die-coated pattern is 10 cm × 10 cm  which is subsequently divided into small samples ( 15 cm × 15 cm )  Fig  1 figure 1 Schematic diagram of slot-die coating process for fabricating PSCs Full size image In the preparation of PSCs via a two-step slot-die coating process  coverage and uniformity of PbI2 film play a vital role in determining the quality of perovskite film  It indicates that the slot-die coating process of PbI2 layer is essential for the preparation of high-performance PSCs  Therefore  we first optimized the thickness of the PbI2 film  Since the thickness of the film prepared by slot-die coating can be determined by various parameters  such as coating speed  ink injection speed and the concentration of precursor solution  some variables need to be fixed during the experiment to keep a single variable  The coating speed and ink injection speed of each layer were constant during the experiment  so we controlled the concentration of PbI2 solution to adjust the thickness of the film  and the spin-coated films reported previously were utilized as reference samples [ 36 ]  Compared with the spin-coated perovskite films  these films prepared by slot-die coating require a lower concentration of PbI2 precursor solution to achieve the same thickness  as shown in Fig  2a  The concentration of PbI2 solution is only 10 M for slot-die coating process  leading to similar thickness ( ~ 700 nm ) of perovskite films prepared by spin coating  Figure 2b shows the UV–vis absorption spectra of the perovskite films  It suggests that the slot-die-coated perovskite film derived from 1 M PbI2 solution presents better absorbance  as compared to other samples  Besides  as shown in Fig  2c  the X-ray diffraction peak at 127° afflicted to PbI2 based on slot-die coating is much stronger than that of spin-coated sample [ 37  38 ]  It indicates that a large amount of PbI2 can not be completely converted to perovskite  especially based on the high concentration of 13 M At the same time  the diffraction peaks of spin-coated perovskite film are much stronger than those of slot-die-coated samples  It is particularly obvious for the peaks located at 142° and 245°  corresponding to ( 110 ) and ( 202 ) crystal planes  respectively [ 373839 ]  It is noted that the slot-die coating and spin coating were carried out in air atmosphere and glove box  respectively  Therefore  the difference of the XRD peaks might result from the influence of moisture and oxygen in air  which could significantly affect the crystallization process and orientation of perovskite [ 31  40 ]  In spite of this  the sample based on 1 M still shows a lower relative diffraction intensity of PbI2 as compared to other perovskite films  demonstrating less PbI2 residue  Also  the PSCs based on different concentrations of PbI2 were fabricated accordingly  and Fig  2d shows the typical J–V curves of the cells under AM 15G illumination of 100 mW cm−2  More detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 1  The performance parameters of PSCs with different PbI2 concentrations first increase and then decrease  However  as compared to spin-coated PSCs  the performance of PSCs with slot-die-coated PbI2 is quite poor in all aspects  This result should be ascribed to excessive PbI2 in perovskite film  which would increase the trap density of perovskite film and reduce the device performance accordingly  But it suggests that the device based on 1 M outperforms among these devices  Therefore  it is obvious that 1 M PbI2 is more suitable for slot-die coating process  Fig  2 figure 2 Properties of perovskite films prepared by slot-die coating or spin coating with different concentrations of PbI2 precursor solution  a Step profiler diagram  b UV–vis absorption spectra and c XRD patterns of the perovskite films  Asterisk ( * )

PbI2 with different solution concentrations  The best photovoltaic parameters are shown in parentheses Full size table Based on the above results  other methodologies were employed to improve the photovoltaic performance  Specifically  blending solvent ( DMF and DMSO ) was utilized to prevent the fast volatilization of the solvent  As depicted in Fig  3a  the perovskite film based on DMF solvent shows inhomogeneous surface morphology with a number of abnormal bulges  which would be ascribed to the rapid precipitation of PbI2 during slot-die coating process due to the low boiling point of DMF  In contrast  the film derived from mixed solvent ( DMF : DMSO volume ratio = 9:1 ) shows much better surface morphology  It is not only because the boiling point of DMSO is higher than that of DMF  but also because the Lewis acid–base adduct intermediate can be formed between PbI2 and DMSO to prolong the crystallization process of PbI2 [ 34  35 ]  Meanwhile  the surface energy of PbI2 precursor solution with blended solvent will increase  which helps to slowdown the drying process of the film  leading to homogeneous surface morphology [ 26 ]  As a consequence  high-quality perovskite film can be achieved  with decent coverage and uniformity  as depicted in Fig  3b  More importantly  the absorbance of the perovskite film can be enhanced dramatically  which is beneficial for the device performance ( Fig  3d )  Although the diffraction peaks assigned to perovskite show negligible difference between these two samples ( Fig  3e )  the performance of PSCs based on mixed solvent is remarkably improved  especially the current density ( Jsc )  which is consistent with the result of absorption spectra ( Fig  3f )  In addition  the standard deviations of the performance parameters including open-circuit voltage ( Voc )  Jsc  fill factor ( FF ) and PCE were reduced significantly  indicating good reproducibility of the devices  as shown in Table 2  The average PCEs of PSCs using blended solvents reaches 1282 %  which is much higher than the average PCE ( 81 % ) of PSCs with only DMF  These results demonstrate that the blended solvent is more suitable for slot-die coating process than pure DMF solvent  so this strategy was adopted in the following experimental results  Fig  3 figure 3 SEM images of perovskite films prepared a without DMSO  b with DMSO and c with both DMSO solvent and additives  d UV–vis absorption spectra and e XRD patterns of perovskite films prepared by spin coating and slot-die coating without DMSO  with DMSO  with both DMSO solvent

and additives  respectively Full size image Table 2 Photovoltaic performance parameters of PSCs prepared by spin coating and fully slot-die coating with different precursor solutions  The best photovoltaic parameters are shown in parentheses Full size table Although the coverage and uniformity of the perovskite film with blended solvent have been greatly improved  the device performance is barely satisfactory  At the same time  the diffraction peak affiliated to PbI2 at 127° is still as strong as ( 110 ) crystal plane of perovskite  indicating a lot of PbI2 residues in perovskite films ( Fig  3e )  Therefore  a few additives of FA/MA/CS cations were added into the PbI2 precursor solution  As shown in Fig  3b-c  the coverage and uniformity of the perovskite films hardly change after the addition of FA/MA/CS cations  indicating that the additives would not damage the surface morphology of final perovskite films  Also  the UV–Vis absorption spectrum and XRD pattern of the perovskite film were measured  Figure 3d shows that the absorbance of perovskite film can be further enhanced with the additives  More importantly  the diffraction peak intensity of PbI2 decreased significantly  while the diffraction peaks at 245° and 284° ascended  corresponding to ( 202 ) and ( 220 ) crystal planes of perovskite  respectively ( Fig  3e )  It suggests that a small quantity of additives is conducive to the crystallization and growth of the perovskite grains  which is beneficial for the slot-die coating process of PSCs  The J–V curves of PSCs demonstrate that the additives can help to further improve the device performance  Consequently  the PSCs display a champion efficiency up to 1455 % with a Voc of 106 V  Jsc of 207 mA/cm2 and FF of 659 % under reverse scan condition  in which the active area is 007 cm2 ( Fig  3f )  Additionally  the steady-state photocurrent of PSC was measured under the illumination of the AM 15G illumination at the bias voltage of 071 V As shown in Fig  4a  the current density eventually stabilized at 2008 mA/cm2  leading to a stabilized power output of 1425 %  The device exhibits ~ 70 % external quantum efficiency at the range of 300–800 nm  resulting in an integrated Jsc of 1977 mA/cm2 ( Fig  4b )  which is in good agreement with the Jsc value obtained from the J–V curves ( Fig  3f )  Fig  4 figure 4 a Stabilized power output

Conclusion All in all  the planar heterojunction PSCs with the configuration of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag were successively fabricated via layer by layer slot-die coating process  The slot-die coating parameters were explored accordingly  especially the concentration of PbI2 precursor solution  which significantly improved the photovoltaic performance of PSCs  Also  it was found that blended solvents and FA/MA/Cs cation additives were beneficial for the slot-die coating process  leading to uniform and compact perovskite films  Accordingly  efficient PSCs were achieved by fully slot-die coating ETL  perovskite layer and HTL  which yielded a champion efficiency up to 1455 %  This work plays a crucial role in promoting the industrialization and commercialization of PSCs

Consortium 2016-2018 copyright years Download chapter PDF 1 Introduction Technologies that have potential for higher power conversion efficiencies with lower production costs could replace silicon ( Si ) technology for future processing  Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites ( MAPbX3 or FAPbX3 where MA ( methylamonium ) =CH3NH3+  FA ( formamidinium ) NH2CH=NH2+  X=I− or Br− )  a group of materials having layers of organic and inorganic elements in alternating form  are considered as potential material for future device applications for their cheap production  Some key features of these perovskite materials are broad and high solar light absorption  low non-radiative recombination rates with easy fabrications process  Use of these organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials for solar energy conversion comes with the prospect of high conversion efficiency at low fabrication cost that has grown in an exponential manner in the last few years to reach efficiency up to 252 % [ 1–5 ]  These types of materials also have widely been used in photodetectors [ 6 ]  lasing [ 7 ]  and light-emitting diodes [ 8 ]  However  this fascinating material has some major drawbacks  Among this  environmental impact of using such materials has to be considered first as lead has remains to be the main constituent of high performing perovskite materials  Also these materials show rapid degradation when exposed to environment  State of art up to now shows stability for thousands of hours  However  for commercial production  stability should be minimum for 10 years  Zhou et al  have reported stability for 2000 h in dark at room temperature in air ambient for mesoporous TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/C device structure [ 9 ]  Again  for temperature higher than 60 °C  rapid degradation of active material as well as devices occurs that could find its route in either fading or new types of reactions accelerating degradation  External factors like water vapor  temperature  oxygen  UV light  etc  and internal factors such as interfacial and within lattice ion migration  electro-migrations are considered as major causes for degradation [ 10 ]  In terms of stability  relaxation should come in the form of single crystals of hybrid halide perovskites that have shown remarkably low trap state densities  long carrier diffusion lengths  and large absorption coefficient  In addition  the as-prepared perovskite single crystals exhibit a narrower band gap than the corresponding films  which means improved photocurrent generation and broader light absorption  These properties are comparable to the best photovoltaic candidate silicon ( Si ) [ 11  12 ]  Different techniques have been used to produce hybrid perovskite single crystals with different cation ( like MA or FA for organic cation and Pb or Sn for inorganic cation ) and anion ( like I or Br or Cl ) in organic and inorganic parts [ 11  13–26 ]  Fabrication of inorganic perovskite single crystals is also reported [ 17  27 ]  These different single crystals are varied in size and growth rate depending on the method iused to grow them  Even monocrystalline perovskite films are also reported that are best suited for the fabrication devices [ 28  29 ]  The electronic and optical properties of these perovskite single crystals and monocrystalline perovskite films are also well studied [ 15  30–43 ]  These studies revealed long carrier diffusion lengths as a result of low trap state density for these hybrid perovskite single crystals that opens the path for the production of reliable and stable optoelectronic devices  This chapter intends to provide recent research on the growth of perovskite single crystals  especially  different growth techniques and elaborated discussion on the fascinating properties of these single crystal perovskites that will follow by their applications in energy harvesting and high energy radiation detection  2 Crystal Structure Perovskites materials are described by common nomenclature formula ABX3  where A and B are cations ( size of A is bigger than B ) and X is an anion  B resides at the body center position of a cubic unit cell surrounded by six anions X ( face centered position ) forming an octahedral [ BX6 ] 4− cluster while A cation resides at the eight corners of the cube [ 44 ]  Crystallographic structure and stability of the perovskite structures could be realized by using Goldschmidt tolerance_factor ( tf ) defined as t_ { text { f } } = frac { { left ( { R_ { text { A } } + R_ { text { X } } } right ) } } { { left { { 2left ( { R_ { text { B } } + R_ { text { X } } } right ) } right } ^ { - 1/2 } } } ( 1 ) where RA  RB  and RX are the ionic radii of the A cation  B cation  and X anion  respectively  For hybrid perovskites of present interest  the larger cation A is organic ; such as MA ( CH3NH3+ ) with RA = 018 nm  FA ( NH2CH=NH2+ ) with RA ~ 019–022 nm [ 13  45–47 ]  Cation B is Pb ( RB = 0119 nm ) or Sn ( RB = 011 nm ) and anion X is generally halides ( Br  I or Cl with RX = 0196  022  and 0181 nm  respectively )  For 09 < tf < 1  ideal perovskite crystal structure with cubic phase is formed  However  for lower values in the range 07 to 09 ( ie  with smaller A or larger B )  orthorhombic  rhombohedral or tetragonal crystal structures are formed  For tf > 1  layered crystal structures are found to form for larger A  3 Perovskite Single Crystal Growth Techniques A few techniques so far have been proposed such as top and bottom seeded solution growth  inverse temperature crystallization  anti-solvent vapor-assisted crystallization  etc  for the growth of perovskite single crystals  Few of them are based on conventional crystal growth processes  The single crystal growth rates as well as sizes of crystals are varied from one type of growth technique to other  Table 1 shows a collection of these data as available in literature so far  For more details about these particular perovskite single crystal growth techniques  readers are suggested to go through the references cited therein  Table 1 Different size and type of perovskite single crystals grown by different techniques and their application area Full size table 31 Temperature-Lowering Method The temperature-lowering method is one of the appropriate techniques for the growth of organo metallic halide perovskite single crystal  It is simple and convenient for the growth of high quality large size single crystals perovskite MAPbX3 ( X=Cl  Br  I )  By reacting an organic halide salt and an inorganic metal salt  saturated aqueous perovskite precursor is prepared at first step  With change in temperature  the solubility of the organic halide perovskites in their corresponding halide solvents varies considerably  However  it is moderate at room temperature  Decrease in the solution temperature induces saturation of the solute  This saturation leads to the development of perovskite single crystals  This method could be divided in two methods depending on position of the seed crystal in crystal growth vessel : top-seeded solution growth ( TSSG ) and bottom-seeded solution growth ( BSSG )  Easy control and stable growth are the main advantages of these two methods  However  this method is not suitable for low solubility materials at high temperature region  311 Bottom-Seeded Solution Growth Method ( BSSG ) This crystal growth technique was developed for crystals that are grown from heated solutions  Figure 1a shows the schematic of a typical crystal growth system  In this process  the seed crystals were formed first by spontaneous crystallization  Optimization of the crystal growth condition was achieved by accurate control of the temperature and selecting of a high quality seed crystal ; in the middle of the crystal holding tray  the seeded crystal was fixed  With the help of an electric motor  this tray along with the seed crystal was rotated during the crystal growth process  Growth of large ( ~centimeter size ) bulk single crystal of MAPbI3 by bottom-seeded solution growth ( BSSG ) method was first reported by Dang et al  [ 13 ]  For this  the temperature of the saturated solution was cooled down slowly from 65 to 40 °C and thus  the single crystal of MAPbI3 ( dimensions of 10 mm × 10 mm × 8 mm ) was formed in a month  The growth rate for this crystal was found to be ~26 mm3 per day ( ~1 mm3/h )  This crystal had two natural facets { 100 } and { 112 }  Lian et al  [ 14 ] also utilized same technique to grow bulk single crystals by lowering the temperature of the growth solution from 100 to 57 °C  In this process  a seed crystal was fixed to a platinum wire ( Fig  1b ) and the dimensions of the grown crystals were ~ 12 mm × 12 mm × 7 mm as shown in Fig  2  Fig  1 figure 1 Schematic representation of the bottom-seeded solution growth method Full size image Fig  2 figure 2 Photographs of bottom-seeded solution grown bulk MAPbI3 perovskite single crystal  Reproduced with permission from Ref  [ 14 ]  Copyright 2014  Nature Full size image 312 Top-Seeded Solution Growth Method ( TSSG ) Growth of bulk single crystals of MAPbI3 by using the top-seeded solution growth ( TSSG ) method was reported by Dong et al  [ 15 ]  During the growth process  a silicon ( Si ) substrate holds the seed crystal at the top of the solution as shown in Fig  3  This Si substrate was air cooled on the part outside of the tube and the seed crystal remains suspended in the solution  Using the temperature discrepancy between the bottom and top of the solution and dissolution of small seed crystals at the bottom  super saturation was induced  This condition leads the growth of bulk MAPbI3 single crystals with size of 10 mm ( length ) and 33 mm ( height )  Fig  3 figure 3 Schematic representation for MAPbI3 single crystal growth by TSSG method Full size image In recent time  the same group has reported for the first time the growth of high quality bulk hybrid ASnI3 perovskite ( A=CH3NH3 or CH ( NH2 ) 2 ) single crystals by using the top-seeded solution growth ( TSSG ) method [ 16 ]  32 Inverse Temperature Crystallization ( ITC ) The inverse temperature crystallization ( ITC ) method is used for the particular materials whose solubility decrease with increase of temperature in specific solvent and compare to other methods  the rate of crystal growth by this method is an order of magnitude faster [ 11  15  17  18 ]  Figure 4 shows the schematic of the crystal growth process  Precursor solution is kept in a bottle and the bottle is kept inside an oil bath  The temperature of the oil bath is raised  After a certain temperature  crystallization starts at the bottom of the bottle  This growth is reversible one as the crystal could dissolve in the solution when temperature of the solution again comes down to room temperature  Based on the inverse temperature or retrograde solubility of organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite in particular organic solvents  ITC was initially proposed by Bakr et al  [ 19–22 ]  This type of inverse solubility induced crystallization and growth occurs within several hours  So  it is widely used to grow bulk single crystal rapidly as compared to temperature-lowering method [ 20  22–24 ]  Fig  4 figure 4 Schematic for ITC method for growth of MAPbX3 single crystals Full size image Basically  in ITC method  the crystal growth process is a balance of dissolution and precipitation  At low temperature  concentration of unbound perovskite molecules is low as most of them are bound by molecules of the solvent  For this reason  concentration of perovskite molecules does not reach saturation  The bonding energy depends on temperature in inverse proportion  For this reason  with increase of temperature  more and more perovskite molecules are free to increase concentration of free perovskite molecules in solution  With increase of temperature at some point  super saturation occurs that enunciates nucleation and crystal growth starts  Single crystal growth by this method depends on the choice of solvent  For the growth of hybrid halide perovskites crystals solvents like g-butyrolactone ( GBL )  dimethylsulphoxide ( DMSO ) and N  N-dimethylformamide ( DMF ) are the most widely used  There is lot of variations in solubility of PbX2 and MAX in these solvents  It has been found that MAPbI3 crystallized more aptly from GBL while MAPbBr3 crystallized better from DMF [ 11 ]  First  MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 single crystals were grown by the rapid ITC method ( Fig  5a–c ) [ 19  48 ]  In later works  Zhao group [ 49 ] succeeded to grow mixed halide perovskite ( CH3NH3 ) Pb ( Br1−XClX ) 3 single crystals  Fig  5 figure 5 Inverse temperature crystallization growth of a MAPbI3 and b MAPbBr3 single crystals at different time intervals  c Continuous growth of MAPbBr3 single crystal by transferring the crystal into a larger vessel containing a fresh growth solution  Reproduced with permission from Ref  [ 19 ]  Copyright 2015  Nature Full size image Bakr group [ 21 ] also synthesized FAPbX3 single crystals using the ITC method by using proper solvent  08 mol L−1 GBL solution was used to reach super saturation and starts crystallization at 115 °C for the growth of FAPbI3 single crystals  Crack and grain boundary-free black FAPbI3 single crystals were grown in 3 h 1:1 ( v/v ) DMF : GBL solution ( 1 mol L−1 ) was used in the growth of FAPbBr3 single crystals using ITC method  Crystallization was found to occur at 55 °C  Yang ’ s [ 24 ] group also reported growth of FAPbI3 single crystal ( 5 mm in size ) with some modification in ITC process  First  FAPbI3 seed crystal was grown by a cooling solution method  This seed crystal was used to grow larger crystal by ITC method  33 Bridgman Growth Method The Bridgman growth technique is a melt crystal growth method that is mostly used to grow large-sized crystal inside the sealed ampoules [ 50  51 ]  Organic compounds become chemically instable and attained high vapor pressure around their melting_point  Single crystal of perovskite materials having definite melting_point could be grown using this property  For this  a quartz ampoule was initially filled with all of the raw reactants and then sealed under the vacuum  At definite temperature  crystallization starts at the tip of the ampoule  Growth of CsPbBr3 single crystals and CsSnI3 polycrystalline ingots has reported by Kanatzidis group using Bridgman growth method [ 17  27 ]  By varying the size of the ampoules  large-sized crystals could be grown by using this growth method  This method has only one limitation that is come from the stress between the surface of the crystal and the ampoules  This stress could induce cracks and small grain boundaries in the crystals  Again as the crystals comes in touch of the crucible wall during growth  impurity level increases in the crystals grown by this method  34 Droplet-Pinned Crystallization Method ( DPC ) Droplet-pinned crystallization ( DPC ) method is used to grow micro-scale MAPbI3 single-crystalline arrays and could be used to grow single-crystalline thin films [ 52 ]  In this process  first MAPbI3 precursor solution is dropped on PEDOT : PSS-coated ITO glass  Over it  a small piece of Si wafer was placed  MAPbI3 starts to disperse along the diminishing direction of the droplet with the evaporation of solvent  Annealing induces formation of rectangular MAPbI3 single crystal arrays within minutes  35 Anti-solvent Vapor-Assisted Crystallization ( AVC ) In the year 2014  Seok and Chang group has shown the anti-solvent-assisted crystallization method which is also known as fast crystallization deposition [ 53 ] and solvent engineering [ 27 ] to produce high quality and dense perovskite thin films  The methods are based on the similar principle : different solubility of MAPbX3 ( X=Cl  Br  I ) in different solvents [ 53–55 ]  The anti-solvent vapor diffusion method comes in handy to grow materials that are highly soluble in a good solvent but have poor solubility in different class of solvents  To support the above statement in general  hybrid halide perovskites show good solubility in DMF  DMSO  and GBL  while they show nonsolubility or low solubility in chlorobenzene  diethylether  benzene  etc  ( the poor solubility solvents here referred as anti-solvent )  The anti-solvent could accelerate the crystallization of these perovskites during spin coating and facilitates to attain uniform film formation  Using this same strategy  the Bakr group [ 11 ] developed a new method to grow large-sized millimeter-scale MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 single crystals  Figure 6 shows the schematic of crystal growth arrangement  Powders of PbBr2 and MABr ( molar ratio 1:1 ) were dissolved in DMF to form the precursor solution  Dicholoromethane ( DCM ) as an antisolvent and the precursor solution ( yellow color in Fig  6 ) was sealed in a closed vessel and stored  Slowly  the evaporation of DCM occurs and its vapor will diffuse into the precursor solution because the DCM mixes well with DMF  The diffusion of DCM in DMF will consume some DMF solvent  Since MABr and PbBr2 can not dissolve in DCM solvent  the consumption of DMF by DCM will result an increase in the concentration of MABr and PbBr2 in the solution  And finally lead to the formation of MAPbBr3 crystals  Huang group found that it was difficult to get high quality MAPbBr3 with a 1:1 mol ratio of MABr and PbBr2 because of their different solubility ’ s in DMF [ 25 ]  PbBr2 and MABr molar ratio of 08 can produce high quality crystals with higher carrier mobility and lifetime  Fig  6 figure 6 Schematic representation of the anti-solvent vapor-assisted crystallization process Full size image 36 Slow Evaporation Method Slow evaporation technique in solution growth processes is a simple method for obtaining single crystals  Xiong et al  [ 26 ] have reported growth of hybrid perovskite in analogous ( benzyl ammonium ) 2PbX4 ( X=Cl  Br ) materials  In this process  a stoichiometric mixture of benzylammonium chloride and PbCl2 in a concentrated HCl aqueous solution was prepared  Upon slow evaporation of N  N-dimethylformamide ( DMF ) solution at 90 °C bulk crystals size ~ ( 5 mm × 10 mm × 2 mm ) were obtained  In spite of simplicity and efficiency in crystal growth by slow evaporation method  sometimes  it becomes hard to accurately control  37 Cavitation-Triggered Asymmetrical Crystallization ( CTAC ) Gorwth of monocrystalline hybrid perovskite films by using CTAC method was first proposed by Bakr group [ 28 ]  This group has shown growth of monocrystalline perovskite films on various types of substrates such as Si wafers  ITO-coated glass  FTO-coated glass  and sputter-coated metal on silicon  Ultrasound has been used in crystal growth process since 1927 [ 56  57 ]  Without seed crystal  only the use of ultra sound promotes nucleation under a low super saturation level  The basic idea of this growth process lies in the fact that if successive cycles of compression and rarefaction sound waves are sending through a solution  then these waves creates and collapse cavities repeatedly inside the liquid  Release of ultrahigh energy during the collapse of these cavities could induce nucleation by overcoming nucleation barrier by increasing local pressure  accumulation of energy  and rapid cooling [ 58 ]  High-speed jets of fluid called microjetting occur through the asymmetric collapse of cavities near a solid surface [ 59 ]  Due to the induced strong shearing force  this process has been used in film thinning and reducing the particle size from long past [ 60 ]  In the growth of monocrystalline perovskite thin film  this force plays a major role  Thickness of the perovskite films depends on the concentration of the precursor solution  When ultrasonic pulses are targeted toward supersaturated precursor solution  excessive nucleation occurs that results in the growth of plenty amount of tiny crystals  4 Optical and Optoelectronic Properties Morphology strongly affects the carrier diffusion length in organometal trihalide perovskite material  Charge carrier diffusion lengths > 100 nm in the hybrid polycrystalline perovskite ( eg  MAPbI3 ) are necessary and vital for the fabrication of high efficiency solar cells  However  recently Dong et al  [ 15 ] has reported more than 175 μm diffusion lengths in MAPbI3 single crystals are grown by a solution growth method under 1 sun ( 100 mW cm−2 )  Even this could exceed 3 mm under weak light for both types of carriers  The reason behind this long diffusion length was ascribed to longer lifetime  higher carrier mobility  and much smaller trap densities compare to polycrystalline MAPbI3 thin films  Thin film showed an absorption cutoff at 800 nm whereas the absorption of single crystal extended up to 850 nm  The shorter wavelength ( ~770 nm ) emission in single crystals than the excitonic absorption peak position ( ~790 nm ) indicates dissociation of all excitons in free electron and hole charge carriers in single crystal with a bandgap of 161 eV  The narrower and blue-shifted PL peak of the single crystals suggests the presence of low trap density  For measuring the optoelectronic properties  a single crystal device was fabricated by depositing 25 nm thick gold ( Au ) film on one facet of the crystal that acts as an anode and for cathode  gallium ( Ga ) was connected on the opposite facet  The EQE of a 3 mm thick single crystal-based solar cell is ranged from 126 to 158 % for wavelengths from 520 to 810 nm  The red shift ( ~50 nm ) of the EQE up to 850 nm for the single crystal device compare to polycrystalline thin films increased the upper limit of the short-circuit current density ( JSC ) for single-crystal-based solar cells from 275 to 33 mA/cm2  The decrease of EQE for the single crystal device at shorter wavelengths indicates that the metal–single crystal interface contains a large defect density  The reason for this large defect density was ascribed to the formation of Pb2+ clusters due to the partial loss of the more soluble methylammonium iodide during the removal of the single crystal from solution  In a separated work  the same group has shown theoretically that Pb2+ clusters tend to form charge traps on the surface of MAPbI3 [ 30 ]  A near unity internal quantum efficiency ( IQE ) ( 95 ± 7 % ) was obtained for 3 mm thick single crystal device  Diffusion length LD is related to carrier mobility ( μ ) and carrier lifetime τ by the following relation L_ { text { D } } = left ( { frac { { mu k_ { text { B } } Ttau } } { e } } right ) ^ { { frac { 1 } { 2 } } } ( 2 ) where kB is Boltzmann ’ s constant  T is the absolute temperature  and e is electronic charge  To estimate μ and τ  dark current ( JD ) versus voltage characteristics of the device was studied  Two types of devices were made : one hole-only device with the structure Au/MSC/Au and other electron only with the structure Ga/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ( PCBM ) : C60/MSC/PCBM : C60/Ga  Three regions were indentified  ( 1 ) At low bias  the current increases linearly with applied bias ( with n = 1 )  ( 2 ) at higher bias voltage J α V2  ie  trap free space-charge-limited current ( SCLC ) regime ( with n = 2 )  ( 3 ) an intermediate regime identified ( a trap-filled regime ) by the rapid increase of current with bias  In the SCLC regime above 107 V  the JD of the device was well fitted by the Mott–Gurney law J_ { text { D } } = frac { { 9varepsilon varepsilon_ { 0 } mu V^ { 2 } } } { { 8L^ { 3 } } } ( 3 ) A large hole mobility ~164 ± 25 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained by curve fitting  The trap-filled limit voltage VTFL defined as the voltage at which all the traps are filled is directly proportional to the trap density by the relation V_ { text { TFL } } = frac { { en_ { t } L^ { 2 } } } { { 2varepsilon varepsilon_ { 0 } } } ( 4 ) where L is the thickness of the single crystal  ε ( =32 ) is relative dielectric constant of MAPbI3  and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity  The trap density nt was estimated to be 36 × 1010 cm−3 which is five orders of magnitude lower than that of polycrystalline thin films of MAPbI3  Similarly  the electron mobility and electron trap density for the electron-only device were measured to be 248 ± 41 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 45 × 1010 cm−3  In a different work  on organolead trihalide MAPbX3 ( MA=CH3NH3+ ; X=Br− or I− ) perovskites single crystals of volume larger than 100 cc grown by anti-solvent vapor-assisted crystallization approach  it was found that the trap densities are exceptionally low on the order of 109 to 1010 per cc which is comparable to the best quality Si [ 31 ]  The absorption spectra of MAPbX3 single crystals show a clear cutoff at band edge with no excitonic absorption  This feature arises due to subsequent reduction in the number of in-gap defect states  However  absorption spectra of polycrystalline MAPbX3 thin films show excitonic features near band edge [ 32 ]  The optical band gap was determined to be 221 and 151 eV for MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 single crystals  respectively  Both types of single crystals show a sharp transition at band edge that could enhance photon harvesting and photocurrent generation compare to their thin film counterpart  Similarly  single crystals show narrow PL peak corresponding to band gap  For determining the carrier diffusion length LD  carrier life time ( τ ) and carrier mobility ( μ ) were separately measured using time of flight technique [ 33 ] and PL decay in addition to transient absorption spectroscopy  respectively  For MAPbBr3 single crystal  the transient current for various driving voltages ( V ) and the transit time τt  ( defined as the position of the kink in the time traces ) were plotted as a function of V−1  Using the transit time τt  sample thickness d  and applied voltage V  mobility μ was estimated to be 115 cm2 V−1 s−1 by linear fit of τt versus V−1 using the equation mu = frac { { d^ { 2 } } } { { Vtau_ { text { t } } } } ( 5 ) This estimation of mobility was higher than the value measured from Hall Effect measurement ( 20–60 cm2 V−1 S−1 )  The disagreement was attributed to the surface effects that are negligible for time of flight measurement  Carrier lifetime t was estimated from transient absorption ( TA ) and PL spectra  Bi-exponential fits prove the presence of two types carrier dynamics : the fast ( t ≈ 74 ns ) and the slow ( t ≈ 978 ns ) carrier dynamics  For MAPbI3 single crystals  mobility was estimated by measuring the current–voltage characteristics ( space-charge-limited current ( SCLC ) technique ) where a quadratic dependency of the current was observed at 300 K From this  dependency μ was obtained as 25 cm2 V−1 s−1  The time-dependent PL measurements for MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 single crystals were carried out for the wavelength of the main PL peak ( ie  λ = 580 nm and λ = 820 nm for MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3  respectively )  Through bi-exponential fits  the bromide- and iodide-based perovskite single crystals showed a combination of fast and slow dynamics ( t ≈ 41 and 357 ns for MAPbBr3  and t ≈ 22 and 1032 ns for MAPbI3 )  These two very different time scales were assigned to the presence of a surface component ( fast ) in addition to a bulk ( band to band recombination ) component ( slow )  By combining the longer ( bulk ) carrier lifetimes with the higher measured bulk mobility and shorter carrier lifetime with lower mobility  LD was estimated [ by using Eq  ( 1 ) ] to be ~17 and ~3 μm in MAPbBr3 single crystals  respectively  Similarly  for MAPbI3 single crystals LD was found to be ~8 and ~2  The current–voltage responses of these hybrid perovskite crystals in the SCLC regime were further investigated in order to find trap density that plays a crucial role in determining μ  τ  and LD  The I–V curves were divided in three regions : at low voltages  the I–V response was ohmic ( ie  linear ) ; at intermediate voltages  non-linear behavior evidenced transition into trap-filled limit ( TFL ) where injected carriers filled all trap states ( VTFL = 46 V for MAPbBr3 and 242 V for MAPbI3 ) ; At high voltages  a quadratic dependence in the Child ’ s regime was observed  As the density of trap states is linearly proportional to the onset voltage VTFL  for MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 single crystals trap densities were found to be 58 × 109 cm−3 and 33 × 1010 cm−3  respectively  In a separate study on FAPbI3 and FAxMA1−xPbI3 crystals formed by hydroiodic ( HI ) acid-assisted inverse temperature crystallization method  it was found that substitution of 15 % MA+ on FAPbI3 crystals stabilizes the phase and gives best charge transport characteristic [ 34 ]  Using slower component of time-resolved photoluminescence ( TRPL ) curves  the carrier lifetime of FAPbI3 and MAPbI3 single crystals were estimated to be 83931 ns and 1455 ns  respectively  All the FA ( 1−x ) MAxPbI3 ( x = 01–02 ) single crystals showed shorter carrier lifetime than that of FA ( 1−x ) MAxPbI3 ( x = 08–09 ) single crystals  The carrier lifetime of the single crystals with different compositions are listed in Table 2  The cut-off absorption wavelength of FA085MA015PbI3 and FA015MA085PbI3 crystals were found at 872 nm and 851 nm  respectively  that reflects a bandgap of 142 eV and 146 eV  respectively  for the crystals  PL emission peak for these two types of crystals were found to be centered at 827 nm and 807 nm  respectively  Using Indium ( In ) /perovskite single crystal/In ( electron-only ) device and Au/perovskite single crystal/Au ( hole-only ) device current–voltage characteristics were studied to estimate both types of charge carrier mobility  By fitting Eq  ( 2 ) and using the values of ε = 469 for FA085MA015PbI3 [ 24 ] and 32 for FA015MA085PbI3 single crystal [ 15 ]  electron and hole mobility were estimated to be 1019 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 531 cm2 V−1 s−1  077 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 066 cm2 V−1 s−1  respectively  Interestingly  when the hole mobility of FA015MA085PbI3 was measured in vacuum  it increased to 1712 cm2 V−1 s−1 which is much higher the mobility measured in air  This indicates that atmosphere interacts with the single crystal and could increase the surface defects

Photovoltaics The characteristics features of the inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite single crystals  such as long carrier diffusion length  very low trap density  absence of grain boundary  etc  if could be transported to perovskite films may overcome the challenges in the development of perovskite solar cells ( PSC )  In this regard  transition from bulk perovskite single crystals to perovskite single crystal films could provide the potential solution  Up to now  there are few attempts to fabricate bulk single crystal perovskite solar cells as discussed in Sect  4  Bakr group [ 28 ] has reported PSC based on monocrystalline perovskite ( MAPBr3 ) film grown by CTAC strategy  One set of solar cells were fabricated by depositing Au electrode on the surface of monocrystalline films grown on ITO glass  In another set of cells  monocrystalline film was grown on compact TiO2-coated FTO glass and Au was deposited on the perovskite monocrystalline film to get a comparison with PSC devices that made from perovskite polycrystalline film of the same device structure  The cell with 1 μm thick monocrystalline film showed a JSC ~ 739 mA/cm2  VOC ~ 125 V  and fill factor ( FF ) ~059 with over all conversion efficiency of 549 %  However  the cell with 4 μm thick monocrystalline film showed a little lower performance with JSC ~ 742 mA/cm2  VOC ~ 124 V  and FF ~ 058  The large JSC value of the cells is further confirmed by calculating the integrated current density from the EQE curve  IQE of the device is more than 90 % over a broad spectral range with maximum 97 % at 507 nm and onset at 550 nm  By considering IQE to be 100 % ( only loss through the reflection and absorption by ITO )  upper limit of this current density was estimated to be 764 mA/cm2  Using the C–V measurement ( Mott–Schottky plot )  built-in potential was estimated to be 121 which is close to the experimental value obtained for VOC  For FTO/TiO2/MAPbBr3 monocrystalline film ( thickness : 1 μm ) /Au structure solar cell  the power conversion efficiency was improved to 653 % ( with VOC of 136 V  a JSC of 696 mA cm−2 and an FF of 069 )  The behavior is similar to the ITO/ MAPbBr3/Au-structured solar cell with a sharp decrease in EQE and IQE beyond 350 nm in UV region due to strong absorption of UV irradiation by FTO/TiO2  52 Detectors Low trap density ( ~109 to 1010 per cc )  long carrier diffusion length  narrower bandgap with high light absorption  and improved photocurrent suggest huge potential of these hybrid perovskite single crystals to be used as photodetectors [ 35 ]  Bakr group has reported a UV detector ( rise time : 24 ms ; decay time : 62 ms ) based on MAPbCl3 single crystals ( thickness 350 μm ) whose performance is comparable to the performance of TiO2 thin films and ZnO nanoparticles-based UV-detectors [ 20 ]  The detector was fabricated by depositing 20 nm thick platinum ( Pt ) layer of transparency 20 % at 365 nm as a top electrode and 20 nm Ti/100 nm Au layer as a back electrode  This detector showed a low dark current ( 415 × 10−7 A ) and high photocurrent ( 47 × 10−4 A ) at 15 V with an ON–OFF ratio 11 × 103  The responsivity of photodetector was estimated as 469 mA/W by using the formula R = frac { { I_ { text { light } } - I_ { text { dark } } } } { { P_ { text { light } } times S } } ( 6 ) where Ilight is the photocurrent  Idark is the dark current  and Plight is the power of incident light  and S is effective area  Detectivity of the same detector was estimated to be 12 × 1010 Jones by using the formula D = frac { R } { { left ( { 2qJ_ { text { dark } } } right ) ^ { 1/2 } } } ( 7 ) where q is the elementary charge and Jdark is the dark current density  Without any encapsulation  the MAPbCl3 single crystal photodetector showed photostability up to 8000 s biased at 15 V under continuous light ( 365 nm  1 W/cm2 ) illumination in ambient condition with humidity 55–60 %  The same device shows high photostability over 12 h under blue light ( 1 Sun excitation density ) which is attributed to the low trap density  Figure 7a shows a schematic of MAPBI3 single-crystal-based photodetector ( effective illuminated area 119 × 10−7 m2 ) where a pair of interdigitized Au film electrodes  with bridging gap of about 20 μm were deposited on the ( 100 ) facet of the single crystal [ 14 ]  The dark current of this device was found to be very low as 11 nA at 4 V bias  Current–voltage characteristics revealed that a Schottky contact was formed between Au electrode and the crystal  The incident power density was varied from 011 to 322 mW cm−2 by using a 532 nm laser as the light source  Responsivity ( R ) was estimated by using formula ( 6 ) and external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) by using the formula Fig  7 figure 7 a Schematic diagram of the planar-type photodetector produced on the ( 100 ) facet of a MAPbI3 single crystal  b Durability and stability of the MAPBI3 single crystal photodetector  Reproduced with permission from Ref  [ 14 ]  Copyright 2014  Nature Full size image { text { EQE } } = R times left ( { frac { hc } { elambda } } right ) ( 8 ) where h represents the Planck ’ s constant  c is the velocity of light  e is the electronic charge  and λ is the wavelength of incident light  From this  the lowest detectable irradiance power density of the single crystal device was estimated to be 212 nW cm−2 with R value of 953 A W−1  For polycrystalline film of MAPBI3 below 120 nW cm−2  irradiance power could not be detected as it was covered by noise  The highest R and EQE for the photodetector based on polycrystalline film were estimated to be 028 A W−1 and 6464 %  respectively  at 1 V bias  Again  under a relative strong light irradiance of 1 mW cm−2  the single crystal device showed about 100 times higher R value of 255 A W−1 compared with the similar photodetector based on polycrystalline film ( R : 00197 A W−1 )  For this single crystal photodetector  a peak photocurrent of 76 μA was achieved at 3 V bias with ON–OFF ratio of 224 ( rise time : 74 μs and decay time : 58 μs )  Figure 7b shows the stability and durability of this single crystal photo-detector in a time scan of 2000 s for the same device before and after 40 days storage at room temperature  A 6 % decay in photocurrent value was notice after 40 days storage  By using the improved photocurrent generation and exciton separation by built-in electric field in the hybrid perovskite single crystals ( achieved either by choosing proper asymmetric electrode material or fabricating heterojunction )  self-powered photodetectors have been proposed [ 35 ]  This self-powered photodetectors eventually works as photovoltaic devices  A self-powered photodetector  achieved by exploiting Pt ( thickness : 20 nm  transparency : 20 % in visible region ) /CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystal Schottky junction has shown photodetectivity of 14 × 1010 Jones at zero bias [ 36 ]  This device showed stable performance in air ambient for over 45 days with rise time of 70 μs and decay time of 150 μs  In another similar type of work by using asymmetric electrodes of Au–Al ( with channel length of 30 mm between the electrodes )  self-powered photodetector based on CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal has been realized [ 37 ]  The photovoltaic effect comes into play in this device depending on the formation Schottkey contacts between the semiconducting single crystal surface and metal electrode that creates the built-in electric field to separate photogenerated electron–hole pairs  This self-powered single crystal photodetector or rather single crystal photovoltaic device produced short circuit current density ( Jsc ) of 686 mA cm−2  open-circuit voltage ( Voc ) of 07 V  and fill factor ( FF ) of 165 % with a overall efficiency of 079 %  The photocurrent showed by this device is 2 orders of magnitude higher than its polycrystalline perovskite film-based device with similar device architecture  The lowest incident power detected by this device was 1 × 10−8 W cm−2 with responsivity ( R ) 024 A W−1 at zero bias  The rise and decay times of this device were estimated to be 71 and 112 μs  In another report  Cao et al  [ 38 ] showed that photodetector made of a core–shell heterojunction based on the MAPbBr3 single crystal renders the feature of self powered due to the built-in electric field at the junction  The perovskite heterojunction is made of a single-crystalline MAPbBr3 core and a crystalline MAPbIxBr3−x shell with sharp frontier and interface between each pure component  The perovskite heterojunction photodetector was constructed on FTO glass over which Au was deposited as anode  This device showed peak responsivity up to 115 mAW−1 under 450 nm irradiation at zero bias and a maximum EQE of 317 % with a rise time of 23 s and a fall time of 276 s Both this values are higher than self-powered device based of pure MAPbBr3 single crystal  This self-powered photodetector produced a short-circuit photocurrent of 01961 mA cm−2  an open-circuit voltage of 061 V  and a fill factor of 0413  Detection of high energy photons having energy ~50 keV to 10 MeV ( like gamma ( γ ) ray  X-ray  etc  ) emitted from decay of various radioactive isotopes has importance in several fields of research and also in non-destructive testing of industrial products  medical diagnostics  and defense [ 39  40 ]  High charge carrier lifetime  mobility  low density of charge traps  high absorption of hard radiation by heavy metals present in hybrid perovskite single crystals allow the fabrication of low-cost hard radiation detectors that are highly sensitive and could be operated at room temperature [ 41 ]  Yakunin et al  [ 42 ] have demonstrated that semiconducting single crystals ( SCs ) of hybrid lead halide perovskites ( MAPbI3  FAPbI3  and I-treated MAPbBr3 ) of size 03–1 cm could work as solid state γ ray detecting material due to the high μτ product of 10–18 × 10−2 cm2 V−1  a low charge trap density of 109 to 1010 cm−3 [ 15  31 ]  a low dark carrier density of 109 to 1011 cm−3 [ 23  31 ]  and a high absorptivity of hard radiation by the lead and iodine atoms  Single crystal of MAPbI3 gives rise to a sensitivity of 065 μC mGyair−1 cm−2 for a photon flux of ~56 × 107 cm−2 s−1 and a photocurrent of 22 nA  If the full penetration depth ~30 μm is considered  then the sensitivity goes to ~220 μC mGyair−1 cm−3 that is one order of magnitude higher than polycrystalline perovskite film detector [ 43 ]  Wei et al  [ 25 ] reported a highly sensitive X-ray detector based on MAPbBr3 single crystal with a record-high mobility–lifetime product of 12 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 and surface charge recombination velocity of 64 cm s−1  Detectors based on 2–3 mm thick single crystal showed detection efficiency up to 164 % at near zero bias under the irradiation of X-ray up to 50 keV  For this type of detectors can detect X-ray dose rate as low as 05 μGyair s−1 with a sensitivity of 80 μC Gy−1air cm−2  6 Future Aspects In a very short span  these metal organic halide perovskites have shown unique properties  Superior semiconducting properties with low-cost deposition techniques open new paths for the metal hybrid halide perovskite applications  Properties like long carrier diffusion length and low trap state density make these hybrid single crystals comparable to best photovoltaic quality Si  This book chapter focuses on the different growth methods for the hybrid halide perovskite with an outlook for possible applications  Around the globe  researchers from all genres are making continuous efforts to unlock the full potential of these versatile materials  Apart from these  some demerits like toxicity due to presence of heavy metal ( eg  Pb ) is needed to be addressed  One such option is to go for fully inorganic halide perovskite like CsPbBr3 which can be grown using solution processes  Most studied application of single crystal halide perovskite is photodetectors that have shown brilliant performance  Another application of these could be in solar cells based on single crystal but to date  the application is not flourished properly  This is due to unavailability of high quality monocrystalline films along with appropriate thickness to be used as perovskite solar cells  Though  the deposition of monocrystalline perovskite films by CTAC method has shown a path toward this goal [ 28 ]  However  a lot has to be remaining to achieve  Other methods should be explored in this direction so as the fascinating properties of bulk single crystals could be incorporated in the geometry of thin films [ 61 ]  Nevertheless  Liu group [ 29 ] has developed a process for the production of thin and shape controlled large size single crystal perovskite wafers for mass production based on ITC growth method  Figure 8 shows the similar schematic of the arrangement used for this type of large size thin single crystal wafer growth  Two slides of glass are kept parallel and aligned with each other by using two spacers  Thickness of the spacers defines the thinness of the grown perovskite single crystal wafer  Growth of the single crystal confines within the gap between the glass slides  Shape of the single crystal wafers is decided by the design of the channel between the two glass slides  To maintain the flow of fresh precursor solution during growth inside the channel  peristaltic pump is used  Fig  8 figure 8 Schematic representation for large size single crystal perovskite wafer growth by ITC method Full size image In the near future  prospects of creating single crystal of high quality with controlled thickness and orientation would fulfill the requirements of this applicationIn this study  the perovskite layers were prepared by two-step wet process with different CH3NH3I ( MAI ) concentrations  The cell structure was glass/FTO/TiO2-mesoporous/CH3NH3PbI3 ( MAPbI3 ) /spiro-OMeTAD/Ag  The MAPbI3 perovskite films were prepared using high and low MAI concentrations in a two-step process  The perovskite films were optimized at different spin coating speed and different annealing temperatures to enhance the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of perovskite solar cells  The PCE of the resulting device based on the different perovskite morphologies was discussed  The PCE of the best cell was up to 1742 %  open circuit voltage of 097 V  short current density of 2406 mA/cm2  and fill factor of 0747  Background Organic perovskite films have drawn much attention for better power conversion efficiency in thin film-type solar cells [ 123 ]  Many growth methods have been developed to prepare perovskite films  Among them  a two-step method is widely used due to its high film quality and reliability of the resulting films [ 4  5 ]  The perovskite is a versatile material prepared from abundant and low-cost compounds  also having unique optical and long excitonic properties  as well as good electrical conductivity  The power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of perovskite solar cells has been improved from 38 to 221 % in recent years  There are two methods for preparing perovskite films : one-step and two-step methods for CH3NH3PbI3 films ; the one-step method is that the PbI2 and CH3NH3I ( MAI ) are mixed in a solvent to form CH3NH3PbI3 films  such as vacuum flash-assisted solution processes  [ 5 ] solvent engineering  [ 6 ] humidity control  [ 7  8 ] and mixed precursors [ 9 ]  Although the one-step method is the most widely used method to prepare the perovskite solar cells  it needs to dissolve both the organic and the inorganic precursors  which reduced the control of the film property including thickness  uniformity  and morphology  The two-step method is that the PbI2 films were first prepared and subsequently reacted with MAI to form CH3NH3PbI3 films  In 2013  Bi et al  [ 10 ] first showed the PCE of 95 % by using two-step method  They prepare PbI2 films on mesoporous TiO2 films the by spin coating a PbI2 solution in dimethylformamide ( DMF )  After drying  the films were dipped in a solution of MAI in 2-propanol to form high-quality CH3NH3PbI3 films for the perovskite solar cells  In the same year  Burschka et al  [ 11 ] showed the certification for the perovskite solar cells prepared by the two-step method and confirmed a power conversion efficiency of 1414 % measured under standard AM15G reporting conditions  After that  many studies using the two-step method to improve the PCE of the perovskite solar cells were reported [ 12131415161718 ]  Moreover  long-term stability is important for the future application of perovskite devices  Several nanostructures  like carbon layer [ 19 ] and graphene oxide-modified PEDOT : PSS [ 20 ]  have been used to suppress degradation in the device and improve their performance  However  few studies discuss the effect of different surface morphology on photovoltaic properties of perovskite solar cells  In this study  we controlled the grain size and morphology of CH3NH3PbI3 by different MAI concentration  annealing  and two-step  Moreover  it was found that the surface morphology of CH3NH3PbI3 films using low MAI concentrations showed large perovskite grains  but the morphology of CH3NH3PbI3 films using high MAI concentrations showed dense and smooth grains  Photovoltaic conversion efficiency of the resulting cells based on the different perovskite morphologies was analyzed using XRD spectra  SEM  UV-vis absorption spectroscopy  and photoluminescence ( PL ) spectra  As a result  the power conversion efficiency of the best cell was up to 1742 %  Methods In this study  fluorine-doped tin oxide ( FTO ) glass as substrate was cut into small pieces with a size of 15 × 15 cm2  The FTO glass substrates were thoroughly cleaned with acetone  ethanol  and deionized ( DI ) water in an ultrasonic oscillator for 5 min  respectively  and dried with nitrogen  A 50-nm compact TiO2 blocking layer was first deposited onto the surface of the precleaned FTO substrate by spray pyrolysis method at a temperature of 500 °C  using a solution of 02 M Ti-isopropoxide and 2 M acetylacetone in isopropanol  The mesoporous layer TiO2 was deposited by spin coating a diluted paste ( Dyesol 18NR-T )  followed by heating to 450 °C  Next  the two-step method was employed to deposit a perovskite layer  PbI2 ( Alfa Aesar  999985 % purity ) was deposited via spin coating from a solution 1 mol/L PbI2 in dimethylformamide ( DMF ) that was heated to 70 °C  with a spin coating speed of 7000 rpm  MAPbI3 was formed by dipping the slide into a 10-mg/mL MAII in isopropanol ( IPA ) solution with different concentrations for 30 s After removing the excess IPA  the perovskite films were then placed on a hot plate set at 100 °C for 20 min  The composition of hole transport material was 0170 M 22′77′-tetrakis ( N  N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine ) -999-spirobifluorene ( spiro-OMeTAD  Lumtec )  with the addition of 60 mM bis ( trifluoromethane ) sulfonimide lithium salt ( LiTFSI  9995 %  Aldrich ) and 200 mM 4-tert-butylpyridine ( TBP  99 %  Aldrich )  The CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 films were coated with a spiro-OMeTAD solution using the spin coating method at 4000 rpm  For the electrical contact  a 100-nm Ag film was deposited onto the solar cell by thermal evaporation  The resultant device was composed of silver/spiro-OMeTAD/MAPbI3/TiO2 mesoporous layer/TiO2 compact layer/FTO/glass  Figure 1 schematically depicts the complete structure  The current density-voltage ( J-V ) curves of solar cells were obtained using a source measurement unit ( Keithly 2400 )  The photoluminescence spectra of the CN3NH3PbI3/glass samples were measured using a microscope-based spectrometer  The active area of the devices is 2 × 5 mm2 by a shadow mask  The X-ray diffraction patterns of the CN3NH3PbI3/glass samples were recorded using a theta-2theta mode  Fig  1 figure 1 Schematic of the complete structure Full size image Results and Discussion Figure 2 shows the top-view ( left column ) and cross-sectional ( right column ) SEM images of the MAPbI3 perovskite films prepared by low-concentration MAI ( 10 mg/mL ) and underwent annealing treatment at different temperatures  It was found that there is a large amount of perovskite particles on the surface and have a tetragonal morphology  as shown in Fig  2a  The particles size and surface morphology of the perovskite films prepared by low-concentration MAI are similar for all samples  Fig  2 figure 2 Top-view SEM images of the MAPbI3 perovskite films prepared by low-concentration MAI ( 10 mg/mL ) with a-d various spin coating speeds and e-h annealing treatments Full size image Figure 3 shows the top-view ( left column ) and cross-sectional ( right column ) SEM images of the MAPbI3 perovskite films prepared by high-concentration MAI ( 40 mg/mL ) and underwent annealing treatment at different temperatures  Perovskite prepared by high-concentration MAI shows tetragonal crystals  the average MAPbI3 domain size from about 200 nm to about 600 nm  as shown in Fig  3  The morphology is different to that of the perovskite prepared by low-concentration MAI  It was found that there are some PbI2 grains on the surface of the MAPbI3 perovskite film with 60 °C annealing  Those are residues caused by the incomplete reaction  The domain size and surface morphology of the perovskite films prepared by high-concentration MAI are similar for all samples  Fig  3 figure 3 Top-view SEM images of the MAPbI3 perovskite films prepared by high-concentration MAI ( 10 mg/mL ) with a-d various spin coating speeds and e-h annealing treatments Full size image Figure 4 shows the XRD patterns of the MAPbI3 films prepared by ( a ) low- and ( b ) high-concentration MAI with different annealing temperatures  As shown in Fig  4a  two main diffraction peaks are observed at 126° and 144°  corresponding to PbI2 ( 001 ) and MAPbI3 ( 110 ) phases  respectively  The intensity of the PbI2 ( 001 ) peak is higher than that of the MAPbI3 ( 110 ) peak when the annealing temperature of the MAPbI3 film increases up to 120 °C  The MAPbI3 film is decomposed into a bi-phase film of the MAI and PbI2  leading to poor efficiency of the perovskite solar cells  Similarly  as shown in Fig  4b  as the annealing temperature is 60 °C  two main diffraction peaks are observed at 128° and 143°  corresponding to PbI2 ( 001 ) and MAPbI3 ( 110 ) phases  respectively  However  the single peak corresponding to the MAPbI3 ( 110 ) phase is observed when the annealing temperature of the MAPbI3 film increases up to over 80 °C  The MAI and PbI2 are formed into the MAPbI3 film  completely  Fig  4 figure 4 XRD patterns of the MAPbI3 films with a low- and b high-concentration MAI Full size image The intensity of photoluminescence ( PL ) spectrum is related to the lifetime of an exciton in the perovskite film and in the interface between TiO2 and perovskite films  The lifetime of the exciton is longer  and the intensity of PL spectrum is stronger ; the decomposition rate of an exciton in the interface between TiO2 and perovskite films is faster  and the intensity of PL spectrum is weaker  Figure 5 plots PL spectra of the MAPbI3 prepared by low- and high-concentration MAI with various spin coating speeds and annealing temperatures  As shown in Fig  5a  b  the optimum spin coating speed and annealing temperature for the MAPbI3 prepared by low-concentration MAI are 2000 rpm and 100 °C  respectively  On the other hand  as shown in Fig  5c  d  the optimum spin coating speed and annealing temperature for the MAPbI3 prepared by high-concentration MAI are 4000 rpm and 120 °C  respectively  Fig  5 figure 5 PL spectra of MAPbI3 prepared by low-concentration MAI with a various spin coating speeds and b annealing temperatures and prepared by high-concentration MAI with c various spin coating speeds and d annealing temperatures Full size image Figure 6 shows the SEM images of the MAPbI3 perovskite films with low- and high-concentration MAI solution under optimum conditions  respectively  The surface morphology of the MAPbI3 perovskite films with low-concentration MAI is rougher than that of the MAPbI3 perovskite films with high-concentration MAI  The grain of the latter is compact and smooth  Also  the coverage rate of the surface of the latter is better than that of the former  Fig  6 figure 6 SEM images of the MAPbI3 perovskite films with a low- and b high-concentration MAI solution under optimum conditions  respectively Full size image Figure 7a shows the PL spectra of the MAPbI3 films with different MAI concentrations  The peak position of PL spectrum increases from 768 to 773 nm when the MAI concentration increases from 10 to 40 mg/mL  The redshift might be associated with the reaction of PbI2 and MAI [ 21 ]  As the PbI2 film is reacted with the MAI solution and formed the MAPbI3 perovskite film  the band gap is shifted toward 155 eV  Also  the intensity of PL spectrum of the MAPbI3 perovskite film using high MAI concentration is decay  To explore the original cause  time-resolved photoluminescence ( TRPL ) was employed to study the lifetime of the excitons  Therefore  the excitons can be quickly extracted to the FTO substrate  for the MAPbI3 perovskite film using high MAI concentration  According to the TRPL spectra shown in Fig  7b  the lifetime of the MAI perovskite films prepared by low and high concentration is 25 and 14 ns  respectively  It can clearly be seen that the exciton lifetime of the MAI perovskite films prepared by high MAI concentration is relatively short  which can be used to explain why the decomposition rate of the excitons is faster  The interface between of TiO2 and perovskite prepared by high MAI concentration is smooth  such that the excitons are separated and extracted quickly to the FTO substrate  as shown in Fig  7b  In addition  it is possible to improve the film quality  resulting in an increase in the speed of the electrons decomposition  Fig  7 figure 7 a PL and b TRPL spectra of MAPbI3 films with different concentrations Full size image Figure 8a  b plots the J-V curves of the perovskite solar cells prepared by low- and high-concentration MAI with different annealing temperatures  respectively  To compare the short-circuit current density Jsc  the perovskite solar cells prepared by high-concentration MAI are higher around 2 mA/cm2 than that of the cells prepared by low-concentration MAI  This may be contributed by better quality of the perovskite films prepared by high-concentration MAI  such that it has a higher absorbance  resulting in a higher photocurrent  Besides  the charge transfer resistance in the perovskite films prepared by high-concentration MAI is small due to the smooth morphology  The films with the smooth morphology can not only increase the contact area between perovskite film and spiro-MeTAD film but also enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency of solar cells [ 22  23 ]  On the other hand  the cells prepared by low-concentration MAI show high Voc  It may be caused by PbI2 residues in the perovskite thin film [ 22  23 ]  To check the reproducibility of performance  power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) is compared using histograms obtained from 50 perovskite devices prepared by low- and high-concentration MAI  as shown in Fig  8c  As can be seen from the results  the devices performed extremely well  The average PCE of the perovskite solar cells prepared by low- and high-concentration MAI is 13 and 137 % with a standard deviation of 1293 and 1275 %  respectively  As shown in Fig  8c  more than 75 % of the cells show PCE above 13 % under one sun conditions  for the perovskite solar cells prepared by high-concentration MAI  That indicates good reproducibility  The optimum results show the power conversion efficiency of 1742 %  open-circuit voltage of 097 V  current density of 2406 mA/cm2  and fill factor of 0747  Fig  8 figure 8 J-V curves of the perovskite solar cells prepared using a low-concentration MAI and b

were investigated  The J-V characteristic curve of perovskite solar cells was used to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency  The results show that the power conversion efficiency was up to 1742 %  open circuit voltage of 097 V  current density of 2406 mA/cm2  and fill factor of 7466 % was the best characteristic  Abbreviations FTO : Fluorine-doped tin oxide J-V : Current density-voltage

Science book series ( SSMATERIALS  volume 303 ) Abstract Luminescent solar concentrators ( LSCs ) are emerging technology of current interest as a platform for solar energy harvesting  LSCs can serve as large-area sunlight collectors for photovoltaic cells to reduce the cost of electricity by decreasing the use of expensive photovoltaic materials  Among various types of fluorophores  perovskite quantum dots have been used as light-converters due to their size/shape/composition-tunable wide absorption spectrum  narrow emission spectrum  high quantum yield and structure-engineered large Stokes shift  In this Chapter  we summarized the use of various types of perovskites and different configuration to fabricate high efficiency and large-area LSCs  The optical properties of perovskite are strongly depending on their size  shape and composition  Therefore  one can optimize their structure to obtain the suitable emitters for LSCs  Among various types of perovskites  doped quantum dots offer a great opportunity to synthesize high quality perovskites with both high quantum yield and large Stokes shift  indicating the doped perovskites may be a great candidate as emitters for high efficiency LSCs  We conclude with a detailed account of the latest research progress in synthesis  structure  materials  and performance of LSCs based on perovskite quantum dots and a further perspective on the remaining key issues and open opportunities in the field  Access provided by SpringerLink Jiangsu eBook Consortium 2016-2018 copyright years Download chapter PDF 81 Introduction Solar technologies represent a great opportunity towards addressing the increasing demand for clean and renewable energy [ 1234567 ]  Radiation impinging from the sun in an hour could power the planet for one year  However  the cost of the electricity generated by commercial silicon photovoltaic ( PV ) devices is still high compared to traditional power plants [ 8910 ]  Luminescent solar concentrators ( LSCs ) are emerging technology of current interest as a platform for solar energy harvesting [ 3  910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334  36373839404142434445 ]  LSCs can serve as large-area sunlight collectors for PVs to reduce the cost of electricity by decreasing the use of expensive PV materials  A typical LSC consists of an optical waveguide embedded or spin-coated with fluorophores [ eg  dyes  polymers or quantum dots ( QDs ) ]  The waveguide could be transparent/semitransparent polymers or glass with high refractive index  Fluorophores partially absorb sunlight and re-emit concentrated emissions at a shorter ( by upconversion fluorophores [ 46 ] ) or longer wavelength ( by down-shifting fluorophores ) [ 47 ]  The concentrated emissions on the edges of the LSC are collected by PV cells placed at the edges of the waveguide  where it is converted into electric power ( Fig  81 ) [ 47 ]  The LSCs could be widely used for building integrated PVs ( BIPVs ) due to its adjustable transparent nature by tuning the type and concentration of fluorophores  light weight  and low-light intensity PV response [ 3  8910  20  30  35  38  47  48 ]  So far  the research direction on LSCs focuses on the improvement of their external optical efficiency ( defined as the ratio between the optical power of re-emitted photons reaching the edges of an LSC and the optical power of incident photons ) by improving the optical properties of the fluorophones and configuration of the LSCs  We take the example of colloidal QDs as fluorophones to explain the energy loss process in LSCs  As shown in Fig  81  sunlight is lost in the LSC based on colloidal QDs in the following ways : ( 1 ) only a fraction of incident sunlight could be absorbed because of the limited overlap between the QD ’ s absorption and solar spectrum ; ( 2 ) part of the sunlight is reflected at the top surface of the LSC ; ( 3 ) sunlight is lost during re-emission process  as the fluorescent quantum yield ( QY  defined as the ratio between the number of emitted photons to the number of the absorbed photons ) is below 100 % ; ( 4 ) the fraction of radiation  which is re-emitted with an emission angle falling into the escape cone can not undergo total internal reflection ( TIR ) inside the waveguide and is lost  The escape cone is determined by the refractive index of an LSC and air ; ( 5 ) part of the sunlight is lost due to re-absorption  which is caused by the overlap between the absorption and emission spectra of the QDs  Usually  energy losses from re-absorption of the emitters occur repetitively  because photons traveling within the waveguide can be absorbed by other emitters and re-emitted with similar energy band edges multiple times before reaching an edge  For example  in practical LSC implementations ( 1 m2 )  even very small overlap between absorption and emission spectra may result in strong energy losses  leading to a low external optical efficiency [ 3  8 ]  It is still a challenge to obtain a fluorophore with overlap between absorption and emission spectra  Other minor light losses could be due to the absorption of emitted light by the polymer matrix or the emissions are quenched by the defects in the polymer matrix or glass  Preparation of the LSC with high external optical efficiency is still very challenging so far  Fig  81 figure 1

optical efficiency ( defined as the ratio between the optical power of re-emitted photons of an LSC and the optical power of absorbed photons ) of an LSC can be calculated as using Eq  ( 81 ) [ 8 ]  $

ηQY is the QY of emitters  ηStokes is the energy lost due to heat generation  ηHost is the transport efficiency of the wave‐guided photons through the waveguide  ηTIR is the reflection efficiency of the waveguide determined by the smoothness of the waveguide surface  and ηSelf is related to self-absorption due to the spectral overlap of absorption and emission  The optical efficiency of the LSCs is different to the external optical efficiency  which is same as the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) [ 10 ]  A common method to estimate ηopt is to couple a PV cell at the end of the LSC  ηopt can be calculated as [ 10 ] : $ $ { upeta } _ { mathrm { o } mathrm { p } mathrm { t } } =frac { { mathrm { I } } _ { mathrm { L } mathrm { S } mathrm { C } } cdot { mathrm { A } } _ { mathrm { P }

the same PV cell under direct illumination  APV is the area of the edge of the LSC ( or the active area on the PV cell  if the area is smaller ) and ALSC is the area of the top of the LSC  During the last thirty years  various types of fluorescent materials have been used as light converters in LSCs  including dyes  polymers  QDs ( eg  CdSe/CdS  PbS/CdS  and perovskite )  and upconversion nanocrystals ( NCs ) etc  [ 3  20  27  28  495051 ]  Among them  inorganic perovskite [ eg  CsPbX3 ( X = Br/Cl  Br/I ) ] QDs have been used for LSCs in view of their size/compositional dependent absorption and emission spectra  wide absorption spectrum  high brightness with a QY up to 100 %  and easy solution phase synthesis [ 31  525354555657 ]  Inorganic perovskite QDs may represent a new promising candidate for large-area and high-efficiency LSCs  In this Chapter  we will focus on the introduction for the various configurations of the LSCs based on the perovskites  including mixed-halide perovskite QDs ; doped inorganic perovskites ; zero-dimensional ( 0D ) perovskite NCs and perovksite nanoplatelets ( NPLs )  82 Single-Layer LSC 821 LSC Based on Mixed-Halide Perovskite QDs Recently  organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite thin films ( CH3NH3PbI3 or CH3NH3PbI3−xClx ) coated on the glass substrate have been used as emitters for LSCs [ 19  58 ]  In the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite  the strong overlap between the emission and absorption spectra lead to strong reabsorption energy loss  indicating that this type of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites is not suitable for large-scale high-efficiency LSCs  In addition  without the surface protection ( eg  polymer )  the perovskite thin film is very sensitive to the moisture  limiting their long-term stability  Zhao et al  first demonstrated the application of mixed-halide CsPb ( BrxI1−x ) 3 inorganic perovskite QDs as highly emissive fluorophores in high performance LSCs [ 26 ]  By only tuning the molar ratio of Br/I or Cl/Br  CsPb ( BrxI1−x ) 3 or CsPb ( BrxCl1−x ) 3 perovskite QDs were synthesized via a hot-injection approach [ 26  34 ]  The as-produced mixed-halide perovskite QDs exhibit a high QY of 40–80 % with a broad absorption ranging from 300 to 650 nm [ 26 ]  A single-layer LSC was further prepared by using polymer as waveguide [ 26 ]  In details  the as-synthesized mixed-halide perovskite QDs were dispersed into monomers of lauryl methacrylate and crosslinking agent of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate ( wt % of 5:1 ) and a UV initiator diphenyl ( 246-trimethylbenzoyl ) phosphine oxide [ 26 ]  Crosslinked poly ( lauryl methacrylate ) ( PLMA ) has long side chains that can interact with surface long-chain ligands ( oleic acid ) on the surface of QDs to prevent agglomeration of the mixed-halide perovskite QDs during polymerization  As shown in Fig  82a  the LSC ( 6 × 6 × 02 cm3 ) appears semi-transparent in ambient environment  and a clear concentrated red light can be seen from their edges ( Fig  82b )  when the top surface of the LSC is partially placed upon simulated one sun illumination ( 100 mW/cm2 )  The as-prepared LSC has a geometrical gain factor of 75 ( G  defined as the ratio between the area of the top of the LSC and the area of the edges of the LSC [ 8 ] )  Figure 82c presents a photograph of two overlapping LSCs using CsPbBr3 QDs ( green ) and CsPb ( Br02I08 ) 3 ( red ) QDs under UV illumination  As shown in Fig  82d  LSCs based on mixed-halide perovskite QDs exhibit an absorption spectrum ranging from 300 to 650 nm  As the overlap between absorption and emission spectra is significantly larger in CsPbBr3 compared to that of the CsPb ( Br02I1−08 ) 3 ( Fig  82d )  by plotting the integrated PL area as a function of the optical paths  Zhao et al  found that the LSC based on CsPb ( Br02I1−08 ) 3 perovskite QDs have a less energy loss compared to CsPbBr3 QDs  For example  the integrated PL area of CsPb ( Br02I1−08 ) 3 QDs remains 05 in 6-cm LSC  which is higher than 03 in 6-cm LSC based on CsPbBr3 QDs due to less photon escape and reabsorption energy loss ( Fig  82f )  By increasing the optical path  the PL spectra of both types of QDs exhibit a red-shift up to 8 nm with a narrowing of the photoluminescence ( PL ) peak width  which confirms that the energy loss is due to light reabsorption ( Fig  82d )  The preparation process for the LSCs based on perovskite QDs is very sensitive to the moisture  With high humidity ( > 40 % )  there is almost no concentrated emission on the edge of the LSC  indicating the degradation of the perovskite materials  due to the fast reaction of the perovskite QDs with the moisture [ 26 ]  Therefore  further a stable polymer protection layer coated on the surface of perovskite QDs may improve the stability of the LSCs  Fig  82 figure 2 Reproduced with permission from Ref  [ 26 ]  Copyright 2017  Elsevier Ltd Photographs of the LSC comprising CsPb (

 83 a   ( { eta } _ { mathrm { o } mathrm { p } mathrm { t } }  ) of the LSC using CsPb ( Br02I08 ) 3 QDs drops exponentially with the increase of the G factor of the LSCs  which is consistent with simulation  A maximum optical efficiency of 2 % is achieved with G of 45 ( Fig  83a )  Increasing the G up to 55 ( corresponding to a LSC length of 11 cm )   ( { upeta } _ { opt }  ) decreased to ~145 % due to reabsorption and scattering loss  The  ( { eta } _ { mathrm { o } mathrm { p } mathrm { t } }  ) of 2 % obtained with the LSCs based on mixed-halide perovskite QDs is comparable to other recent inorganic QDs-based LSCs ( eg  PbS/CdS or CdSe/CdS )  With the ideal CsPb ( Br02I08 ) 3 QDs with a QY of 100 %  the optical efficiency could be up to 9 % and with an internal quantum efficiency ( IQE ) of 70 % ( Fig  83b )  An ideal CsPb ( Br02I08 ) 3 QDs  with QY of 1  would have a maximum optical efficiency of more than 6 % at G = 45 [ 26 ]  Fig  83 figure 3 Reproduced with permission from

electro-optical method of comparing the Jsc  The dotted lines are calculated for QDs with QY = 075 and QF = 20 ( red dashed line )  QY = 06 and QF = 50 ( green dashed line )  QF is quality factor defined as the ratio between the absorption coefficient ( α1 ) at the wavelength λ1 of collected light and the absorption coefficient ( α2 ) at the emission peak )  Full size image Even the single-layer LSC based on the perovskite CsPb ( BrxI1−x ) 3 QDs exhibited an optical efficiency of 2 %  this optical efficiency is still far from the value ( 6 % ) for potential commercialization [ 10 ]  In addition  the smaller spectral overlap in mixed-halide perovskite QDs compared to that of CsPbI3 or CsPbBr3 is due to the energy transfer between the QDs  which leads to the decrease of QYs [ 26 ]  Further optimization of the size distribution of QDs and their QY is required to further improve the optical efficiency of LSCs based on mixed-halide perovskite QDs  Another issue in mixed-halide lead based perovskite QDs is their toxicity  Further research direction should focus on the replacement of Pb by Sn or other low-toxic/nontoxic elements ( eg  Ag  In  Sb )  822 LSC Based on Doped Perovskite QDs Several strategies have been used to decrease the spectral overlap between the emission and absorption  including structure engineering and doping the QDs with ions [ 3  18  38 ]  Especially in doped QDs  there could be not any spectral overlap between the doped ion emission and absorption spectrum  by creating the energy level between the conduction and valence bands [ 20  21  29  40  46  596061626364656667686970 ]  Variety of transition metal atoms  such as manganese ( Mn ) and ytterbium ( Yb ) have been demonstrated for perovskite NCs [ 21  37 ]  Meinardi et al  demonstrated the use of Mn-doped CsPbCl3 QDs ( Mn2+ : CsPbCl3 ) for large-area LSCs [ 21 ]  The LSCs were fabricated via mass copolymerization of acrylate monomers  The as-synthesized doped perovskite QDs have a very narrow size distribution ( 86 ± 06 nm ) as shown in Fig  84 a  The typical Mn concentration in the QDs is around 39 %  High resolution TEM ( HRTEM ) image of the Mn2+ : CsPbCl3 with 5 % Mn shows a Mn2+ ion in a substitutional Pb site with essentially identical octahedral coordination with six halide atoms ( Fig  84a )  The X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) pattern indicates a match with cubic CsPbCl3 ( Fig  84a )  Typical dual emissions were found in the Mn2+ : CsPbCl3 QDs ( Fig  84 a )  The Mn2+ : CsPbCl3 QDs have sharp absorption edge at ∼395 nm and the respective narrowline band energy ( BE ) PL peaked at ∼405 nm  The BE PL emission accounts for ∼20 % of the total emission and the remaining 80 % of emitted photons are due to the 4T1 → 6A1 optical transition of the Mn2+ dopants  showing a characteristic broad peak at ∼590 nm  resulting in a well separation of the absorption edge and the Mn2+ emission  While in the doped QDs  the QY is still quite low  5 ± 1 % for the BE emission and 10 ± 2 % for the Mn2+ emission  The low QY is a strong limited factor for high efficiency large area LSCs  A possible synthetic approach may use core/shell structure to improve the surface passivation of the doped QDs  in order to improve the QY of the QDs  As shown in Fig  84b  the emission spectrum of the doped emission is quite broader compared to that of the BE emission spectrum  This is very good properties for the LSC application  The narrow emission line with high light density will lead to the absorption saturation of the PV  and some of emission can not absorb by the PV  further decreasing the optical efficiency of the LSCs [ 10 ]  With broader emission spectrum  the PV can absorb as much as possible the concentrated light at the edges of the LSC  thus leading to the improved optical efficiency of the LSC  Fig  84 figure 4 Reproduced with permission from Ref  [ 21 ]  Copyright 2017  American Chemical Society a Structure of Mn2+ : CsPbCl3 QDs

small absorption contribution due to the C–H vibrational modes of the ligand molecules ( the measurement is corrected for solvent effects ) between 650 and 900 nm and by direct absorption between

photographs of the LSC ( LSC dimensions : 25 × 20 × 05 cm3 ) comprising 003 wt % Mn2+ : CsPbCl3 QDs under 365 nm UV-illumination  showing yellow concentrated emission  In order to experimentally quantify the scattering losses of the LSC at the emission wavelength of the Mn2+ PL  light propagation experiments were performed by using a collimated laser source at 633 nm  The laser enters the device from one edge and the emission is collected from the LSC faces  The scattering losses for the Mn2+ PL are essentially negligible ( Fig  85b )  There is no significant Mn-PL loss after embedding the QDs into polymer matrix as confirmed by the unchanged lifetime before and after embedding in the polymer matrix ( Fig  85d )  Consistently  there is no Mn2+ PL difference ( peak position and peak width ) before in solution and after transferred into polymer matrix  which demonstrates that the polymerization procedure does not modify the spectral optical properties of the Mn dopants [ 21 ]  In contrast  the BE PL shows a faster decay compared to toluene ( Fig  85e )  which suggests that excitons of BE are more subject than the Mn2+ to surface reactions  The PL spectrum of the LSC using Mn2+ : CsPbCl3 was collected from one of the slab edges ( 20 × 05 cm2 ) using 395 nm laser excitation positioned at different distances  d  from the waveguide edge  There is slight PL spectrum shift in the Mn-PL as there is no spectral overlap between the absorption spectrum and the Mn-PL spectrum  While a significant shift was found in BE emission because of strongly overlap between the absorption spectrum and BE-PL emission ( Fig  85f )  In Fig  85g  the relative output power extracted from one of the LSC edges ( 20 × 05 cm2 ) was measured by coupling silicon solar cells to one edge and by progressively exposing increasingly larger portions of the LSC area to the solar simulator  The calculated curve by Monte Carlo ray tracing simulation matches well the experimental data as large as ∼80 %  indicating that suppression of reabsorption in Mn2+ : CsPbCl3 perovskite QDs is effective in rendering the device behavio  Fig  85 figure 5 Reproduced with permission from Ref  [ 21 ]

experimental configuration  Full size image Compared to CsPbCl3 or mixed-halide perovskite QDs  Mn-doped perovskite open a new way to avoid the energy loss due to the reabsorption in the large-area LSC based on perovskites  showing potential for using perovskite in the community of LSCs [ 21 ]  While in the Mn-doped CsPbCl3 perovskite  the absorption spectrum is only ranging from 300 to 400 nm ( 5 % of solar irradiation ) and the QY is relatively low ( 10 % )  limiting their further application as building blocks for high-efficiency large-area LSCs  In addition  even there is no energy loss in Mn-PL  the strong overlap between the absorption and the BE emission spectra leads to significant energy loss due to the reabsorption  The sensitivity of the BE emission ( 20 % over the total emission in doped QDs ) to the surface reaction indicates that the Mn-doped perovskite is not stable at ambient condition  All these issues limit the Mn-doped perovskite for high efficiency LSCs  Further research direction may focus on selecting other dopants and hosting structure of perovskite to extend the absorption range of the perovskites and decrease/avoid the BE PL  Improving the QY may consider the core/shell structure to protect the surface of the QDs  Compared to Mn-doped perovskites  recently Luo et al  reported the LSC using Yb3+-doped perovskite QDs ( Yb3+ : CsPbCl3 ) [ 40 ]  Yb3+ doping leads to quantum-cutting effect  which is a peculiar optical phenomenon referring to the emission of two low-energy photons by absorbing one high-energy photon [ 37  40 ]  These QDs feature a QY approaching 200 % theoretically  Considering the QDs absorb one high energy photon ( wavelength in 300–400 nm )  and emit two long-energy photons ( ~990 nm )  there is still energy loss ( > 05 eV for one absorbed photon ) theoretically  The typical morphology of the Yb3+-doped CsPbCl3 QDs was shown in Fig  86a ( inset )  There is no significant difference for the absorption feature between the doped and undoped CsPbCl3 QDs ( Fig  86a )  while their PL spectra are different  Due to effective excitation energy transfer from CsPbCl3 host to Yb3+-dopants  the BE PL of QDs is strongly quenched in the doped sample and is replaced by a sharp PL band ( Yb emission ) at ∼990 nm arising from the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 ff emission of Yb3+-dopants  This behavior is very different to Mn doped perovskites  in which a clear dual emission was observed [ 66 ]  The QY of the dopant emission is ~164 ± 7 %  an indication of quantum-cutting effect  Yb3+-doped CsPbCl3 QDs were incorporated into LSCs by coating QD-poly ( methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) mixtures as thin-films onto borosilicate glass substrates using doctor-blade or spin-coating methods  The dimensions of the LSC are 5 × 5 × 02 cm3 ( G of 625 )  LSC under sunlight shows a transparent appearance ( Fig  86b )  By the application of UV illumination in combination with a 570 nm long-pass filter  strong near-infrared ( NIR ) emissions from the edges can be seen using a cell phone camera ( inset  Fig  86b )  The IQE of the LSC is calculated to be 1181 ± 67 %  Luo et al  further predict that if using CsPbClxBr3−x QDs capable of absorbing ∼76 % of solar photons  the projected optical efficiency of quantum cutting-LSCs can exceed 10 % for > 100 cm2 devices [ 40 ]  The advantage of quantum-cutting LSCs over conventional QD-LSCs could be especially obvious with increasing LSC sizes due to the lack of energy loss because of emission and absorption spectral overlap  Fig  86 figure 6 Reproduced with

dimensional ( 3-D ) undoped perovskites ( eg  CsPbX3 ) having a large emission/absorption spectral overlap  zero-dimensional ( 0-D ) inorganic perovskites [ eg  Cs4PbX6  ( X = Cl  Br/Cl  Br )  Cs4SnBr6  Cs4−xAxSn ( Br1−yIy ) 6 ( A = Rb  K ) and Cs3Cu2I5 ] allow a minimal absorption and emission spectral overlap ( large Stokes shift  defined as the energy difference between positions of the band maxima of the first-excitonic absorption and emission spectra ) [ 52  54  55  57  717273747576 ]  There is no obvious absorption and emission spectral overlap in the case of Cs4SnBr6 perovskite NCs [ 72 ]  There is no quantum confinement effect in 0-D perovskite  thus this type of perovskites does not belong to the family of QDs [ 52 ]  In another word  one can not tune the optical properties of the 0-D perovskite by tuning the size of the perovskite NCs  Zhao et al  reported the fabrication of the LSC based on 0-D perovskite by spin-coating or drop-casting perovskite/polymer solution on a glass substrate ( Fig  87a  top ) [ 38 ]  The PL signals from the LSC were recorded at a certain distance  d  between the edge and vertically illuminated spot at excitation wavelength of 400 nm  There is very slightly spectral variation as a function of the optical paths for the LSC based on Cs4PbBr6 NCs ( Fig  87b  d )  In contrast  CsPbBr3 NCs exhibit a significant PL red-shift  The unchanged PL peak in 0-D perovskite NCs may be due to the narrow emission spectrum and broad absorption spectrum of the 0-D NCs  In a contrast  for 3-D CsPbBr3 NCs  the PL peak shows a strong red-shift as both the emission and absorption spectra in the overlapping range are very sharp ( Fig  87d )  This result is the straightforward evidence that 0-D perovskite NCs may be better candidate as emitter for LSCs applications compared to 3-D perovskite NCs  While compared to doped perovskite QDs  Cs4SnBr6 perovskite NCs still have a sight overlap between the absorption and emission spectra

by a 15 AM global solar simulator ( 100 mW/cm2 ) or natural sunlight ( 30 mW/cm2 )  With the increase of the Cs4PbBr6 concentration  the external optical efficiency of the LSCs increases from 08 ± 015 ( 15 wt % ) to 14 ± 015 ( 3 wt % ) and 22 ± 02 ( 45 wt % )  due to the increase of the absorption of sunlight  The absorption of sunlight of perovskites with tunable concentrations was calculated to be 43 % ( 15 wt % )  76 % ( 3 wt % ) and 116 % ( 45 wt % )  respectively  As the absorption of the Cs4PbBr6 perovskite NCs is very strong in the range of 300–400 nm compared to 400–500 nm  the increase of concentration can only lead to the increase of the absorption in the long-wavelength range  which explains that the increase of absorption is not proportional to the concentration  The current obtained highest external optical efficiency ( 24 % under one sun illumination ) is comparable with those reported for the LSCs based on perovskite NCs ( Table 81 )  The higher optical efficiency in 0-D perovskites compared to 3-D perovskites is due to their less absorption and emission overlap  At low-light intensity ( 30 mW/cm2 )  the LSC based on Cs4PbBr6 NCs ( 3C0  10 × 10 × 04 cm3 ) exhibit a PCE of 18 % ( Fig  88a )  which indicates that the Cs4PbBr6 NCs is good absorbers for the LSC  as this system could operate at lower light intensity condition [ 38 ]  The predicted optical efficiency of the LSCs based on 0-D perovskite is strongly dependent on the concentration and QY of the perovskite  and the highest optical efficiency could be up to 9 % ( Fig  88b  c )  In addition  the LSCs based on 0-D perovskite have a good photostability  In view of the simple synthesis procedure and excellent optical properties  0-D perovskites  [ eg  Cs4PbBr6  Cs4Sn ( BrxI1−x ) 6  Cs4-xRbSn ( Br1−yIy ) 6 and Cs3Cu2I5 ] with broad absorption represent a practical emitter for large-area  high efficiency LSCs  Table 81 Performance in LSCs based on various types of perovskites Full

halide perovskite nanoplatelets in order to prepare high-efficiency LSCs [ 77 ]  Compared to spherical-shape perovskite QDs ( or NCs )  layered  or quasi-two-dimensional ( 2-D ) perovskites  consist of sheets of 3-D perovskites sandwiched by bulky cations that divide the corner-sharing inorganic octahedral 3-D framework [ 77 ]  The thickness of 2-D nanoplatelets ( NPLs ) can be well controlled through the reaction conditions  For example  PbBr2  MABr and HEABr were dissolved in N  N-dimethylformamide with the identical concentration of PbBr2 at 006 M Molar ratios of PbBr2  MABr and HABr were tuned to control domain distributions [ 77 ]  Then the stock precursor solution was dipped into chlorobenzene to form perovskite NPLs  The typical size of the perovskite NPLs is several hundred nanometers  The perovskites have a formula R2 ( MA ) n−1PbnX3n+1 ( R = bulky cation  X = Cl/Br/I )  where n represents the number of stacked inorganic sheets contained within one layer  Decreasing n increases the electronic bandgap and exciton BE due to quantum and dielectric confinement  Ideally  layered perovskite ensembles offer the possibility of controlling the Stokes shift while maintaining a high QY by adjusting the n values of the constituent layers  Wei et al  first used perovskite NPLs for LSC fabrication [ 77 ]  PMMA polymer was chosen as the polymer host  Perovskite LSCs were fabricated by depositing a mixture of NPLs and PMMA in chlorobenzene onto glass substrates by rod coating  The LSC fabricated has dimensions of 10 × 10 × 02 cm3  with a G of 125  The PL and absorption spectra of the LSC film with NPLs and perovskite QDs were shown in Fig  89a  Compared to a small Stokes shift in perovskite QDs  there is larger Stokes shift in perovskite NPLs due to the energy transfer inside NPLs  A photograph of the 10 × 10 cm2 NPLs LSC is provided in Fig  89b  Reabsorption loss was both evidenced by PL loss as well as the continuous decay of the integrated PL intensity as the optical length increases ( Fig  89c  d )  The reabsorption of the engineered NPLs is sufficiently small to enable low-loss LSCs  The performance of the LSC based on perovskite NPLs was measured for device areas ranging from 2 × 2 cm2 to 10 × 10 cm2 with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm as shown in Fig  89e  The average QY and optical efficiency decreases as the LSC length increases from 2 to 5 cm  To evaluate the potential of perovskite LSCs for real-life applications  electro-optical measurements were conducted for the LSC film ( 10 × 10 cm2 ) under outdoor conditions  An optical efficiency of 25 % was obtained for the LSC based on NPLs  The high optical efficiency is a combination effect of high QY and relatively low reabsorption losses [ 77 ]  The perovskite NPL LSCs showed a 20 % decrease in PL intensity after 8-h illumination  comparable to the QD LSCs ( Fig  89f )  Fig  89 figure 9 Adapted with permission from Ref  [ 77 ]  Copyright 2019  Nature Publishing Group a

independent measurements  f An accelerated light-soaking stability test of perovskite LSCs  The excitation source is a 374 nm laser diode  which corresponds to an acceleration factor of 20 Full size image Although the overlap between the absorption and emission spectra of the NPLs is smaller compared to that of perovskite QDs  the presence of spectral overlap still leads to energy loss  especially in large-area LSC ( ~m2 )  In view of the use of organic cations in perovskite NPLs  the stability of the LSC is still not excellent for long-term application  In addition  the toxic lead may be replaced by other metals  such as Sn or Ge  83 Tandem LSC Based on Perovskite QDs Single-layer LSCs fabricated using colloidal perovskite QDs ( or NCs ) still face major challenges such as low optical efficiency and limited long-term stability  A tandem structured LSC can improve the light absorption efficiency and decreasing the energy loss due to the light emitted because of the escape cone  Tandem LSCs can absorb different portions of the solar spectrum using different layers of emitters allows to realize high efficiency multi-layered LSCs compared with standard single-layer LSCs [ 28  33  34  78 ]  Zhao et al  reported a large-area ( ~100 cm2 ) tandem LSC based on carbon dots ( C-dots ) and inorganic mixed-halide perovskite QDs [ 34 ]  Generally  there would be two layers or three layers in tandem structured LSCs  As shown in Fig  810a–c  LSCs ( LSC dimensions : 10 × 10 × 02 cm3 ) based on C-dots and perovskite QDs exhibit very good transparency in the visible range  The estimated sunlight absorptances ( ηabs  see experimental section for details ) for the three LSCs are : 15  61 and 71 % for the C-dots  CsPb ( Br08Cl02 ) 3 and CsPb ( Br02I08 ) 3  respectively based on their absorption spectra  As shown in Fig  810d–f  a clear concentrated light can be seen from the edges  when the top surface of the LSC is placed under one sun illumination ( 100 mW/cm2 )  Figure 810g presents photographs of three overlapping LSCs using C-dots ( blue )  CsPb ( Br08Cl02 ) 3 ( green ) and CsPb ( Br02I08 ) 3 ( red ) under one Sun illumination  in which all blue  green and red emissions are clearly visible  indicating the possibility to fabricate tandem LSC based on C-dots and perovskite QDs [ 34 ]  Fig  810 figure 10 Reproduced with permission from Ref  [ 34 ]  Copyright

is 13 %  Full size image The as-fabricated semi-transparent LSC exhibits an external optical efficiency of ~3 % under sunlight illumination ( 100 mW/cm2 )  which represents a 27 % enhancement in efficiency over single layer LSC based on CsPb ( BrxI1−x ) 3 QDs and 117 % over CsPb ( ClxBr1−x ) 3 QDs ( Fig  811 ) [ 34 ]  The experimental data is consistent with the simulated optical efficiency  indicating that the tandem structure can significantly enhance the efficiency of the LSCs  In fact  as the structure of mixed-halide perovskite QDs can be tuned simply by controlling the molar ratio of Cl/Br or Br/I  one can optimize the absorption range of the QDs and concentration of the QDs to further enhance the efficiency of the tandem LSCs  The expected optical efficiency in tandem LSCs could be up to 10 % ( Fig  810d )  Fig  811 figure 11 Reproduced with permission from Ref  [ 34 ]  Copyright 2018  Elsevier Ltd Analytical model of the performance of the different LSCs  a External

The drawback of perovskite QDs is their strong sensitivity to the moisture and ultraviolet light  Zhao et al  used the top layer of the LSC based on C-dots on the LSCs based on perovskite QDs to dramatically enhance the long-term durability of LSC devices because C-dots have a very good photostability under UV light [ 34 ]  The first C-dots layer filters the UV light  and then the perovskite QDs avoid the long-term operation under UV light  In summary  tandem structure LSCs have the following advantages compared to the single layer LSCs : ( 1 ) the optical efficiency can be enhanced significantly ; ( 2 ) the photostability is much better than that of single layer LSCs ; ( 3 ) other than only optimization of one type fluorophores  in the tandem structure LSCs  one can select different types of fluorophores to design and prepare tandem LSCs with high optical efficiency  However  in the tandem configuration  the use of PV on the edges of the LSCs is several-time larger than that in the single layer LSC  In addition  the cost for the installation of the tandem LSCs is higher than that of single layer LSC  Last but not least  without well sealing  the LSCs based on perovskite are still sensitive to moisture  limiting their further long-term use in high efficiency LSCs  84 Bilayer LSCs Based on Perovskite QDs Another strategy to improve the optical efficiency of the LSCs based on perovskites is to use the biolayer configuration ( Fig  812a ) [ 37 ]  The key for this type of LSC is that the emission spectrum of the first layer does not overlap with the absorption spectrum of the second layer  Cohen et al  used the Yb doped CsPbX3 NCs as the emitters in the first layer and CuInS2 QDs in the second layer ( Fig  812a ) [ 37 ]  In this configuration  high-energy sunlight is first absorbed by the quantum-cutting Yb3+ : CsPbCl3 NCs  Lower-energy light is transmitted by the top layer and absorbed in the second layer  CuInS2 QDs with a broad NIR absorption was selected as the emissive materials for the second layer [ 37 ]  There is no any overlap between the absorption spectrum of the CuInS2 and emission spectrum of the Yb3+ : CsPbX3 ( Fig  812b ) [ 37 ]  In addition  there is also no overlap between the absorption spectrum of the Yb3+ : CsPbX3 and the PL spectrum of the CuInS2 QDs  In this way  during the light travelling  there is no PL loss due to the reabsorption  because there is no overlap of the absorption and emission spectra  This bilayer structure improves the optical efficiency of the bilayer LSC by eliminating thermalization losses associated with the blue photons  Unlike tandem LSCs  this bilayer structure can avoid the use of two separate LSCs  Modeling suggests that a bilayer LSC using Yb3+ doped CsPb ( Cl025Br075 ) 3 NCs for the top layer could improve the performance of an idealized CuInS2/ZnS NC LSC bottom layer by at least 19 % ( Fig  812c )  Overall  Cohen et al  suggested a new device structure for the development of next-generation NC LSCs [ 37 ]  For large-area bilayer LSCs  it is still a challenge for LSC fabrication as there should be no any air gap between the two layers  Further research direction may focus on designing the biolayer LSCs by selecting various types of suitable emitters for high efficiency LSCs  Fig  812 figure 12 Adapted with permission from Ref  [ 37 ]

of perovskites and different configuration to fabricate high efficiency and large-area LSCs  The optical properties of perovskite are strongly depending on their size  shape and composition  Therefore  one can optimize their structure to obtain the suitable emitters for LSCs  Among various types of perovskites  doped perovskite QDs offer a great opportunity to synthesize high-quality perovskites with both high QY and large Stokes shift  indicating the doped perovskites may be a great candidate as emitters for high efficiency LSCs  Although the current techniques have lead to high quality LSCs  there are still some issues needed to be solved : ( 1 ) there is still no report for producing doped perovskites with wide absorption  As both Mn and Yb doped CsPbCl3 perovskite have a limited absorption ( less than 400 nm )  the maximum optical efficiency of the LSCs is far from the commercial value ( 6 % )  It is still very challenge to obtain high efficiency LSCs based on perovskites ; ( 2 ) the above mentioned perovskites used for LSCs contains heavy-metal Pb  which limits these perovskite emitters used for further potential commercialization  unless these materials can be sealed very well during the LSC fabrication  use and further disposal ; ( 3 ) the long-term stability of the perovskites is not good compared to other reported high-quality emitters ( eg  C-dots  CdSe/CdS QDs )  as the perovskites are very sensitive to the moisture and UV light  Technically  it is still very difficult to prepare core/shell structure  in which the shells typically give a better surface protection for the core ; ( 4 ) the theoretical simulation predicts the high optical efficiency in large area LSCs ( 10 % )  while experimentally there is still lack of reliable technique to prepare a large area ( ~1 m2 )  high performance LSCs  Further research direction for fabricating high-efficiency LSCs based on perovskites may focus on ( 1 ) developing a technique ( eg  core/shell structure ) to synthesize high quality emitters for LSCs  including wide absorption  high QY ( up to 100 % [ 74  79 ] )  large Stokes shift and high stability ; ( 2 ) replacing the Pb with Sn or other low-/non-toxic metals ; [ 56 ] ( 3 ) other than tandem or biolayer configuration  a laminated structure should be developed to protect the perovskite against the moisture or other chemicals  In addition  the laminated structure can engage with the industrial technique to produce large sized LSCs with low-cost  Referencesorphology and surface property of ZnO thin films as electron transporting layer in perovskite solar cells are crucial for obtaining high-efficient and stable perovskite solar cells  In this work  two different preparation methods of ZnO thin films were carried out and the photovoltaic performances of the subsequent perovskite solar cells were investigated  ZnO thin film prepared by sol–gel method was homogenous but provided high series resistance in solar cells  leading to low short circuit current density  Lower series resistance of solar cell was obtained from homogeneous ZnO thin film from spin-coating of colloidal ZnO nanoparticles ( synthesized by hydrolysis–condensation ) in a mixture of 1-butanol  chloroform and methanol  The perovskite solar cells using this film achieved the highest power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 479 % when poly ( 3-hexylthiophene ) was used as a hole transporting layer  In addition  the stability of perovskite solar cells was also examined by measuring the photovoltaic characteristic for six consecutive weeks with the interval of 2 weeks  It was found that using double layers of the sol–gel ZnO and ZnO nanoparticles provided better stability with no degradation of PCE in 10 weeks  Therefore  this work provides a simple method for preparing homogeneous ZnO thin films in order to achieve stable perovskite solar cells  also for controlling their surface properties which help better understand the characteristics of perovskite solar cells  Similar content being viewed by others Advances in the Application of Perovskite Materials Article Open access 10 July 2023 The Main Progress of Perovskite

solar cell is one of the most promising photovoltaic devices where origin of the innovation started in 2009 ( Idigoras et al  2016 )  Ever since its discovery  the efficiency of the device has been continuously improved  and the maximum efficiency now passes the 20 % barrier ( Idigoras et al  2016 ; Bishop et al  2017 ; Yang et al  2017 ; Baker et al  2017 ) where it can be at a point to rival that of the conventional Si solar cell  Perovskite solar cell has several advantages including the feasibility to fabricate a large area solar panel using low-cost ( Bishop et al  2017 )  wet processing techniques such as spray coating ( Bishop et al  2017 ; Yang et al  2017 )  roll-to-roll ( Baker et al  2017 )  and ink jet printing ( Bishop et al  2017 ; Yang et al  2017 )  The perovskite solar cell also exhibits better mechanical flexibility since the device can be fabricated at room temperature using polymer substrate  This opens the possibility of integrating the flexible solar panel with curved surface or with any shape of buildings  Another one advantage is that the photovoltaic property of the device can be selectively tuned since its structure consists of five main layers including counter electrode  hole transporting layer ( HTL )  perovskite active layer  electron transporting layer ( ETL ) and transparent conductive oxide ( TCO ) glass ( Son et al  2015 )  To achieve reasonable conversion efficiency  ideal interlayers for efficient charge extraction and transportation are still required ( Zhao et al  2017 )  Free electrons are transported to the electrode through the metal oxide ETL layer  A variety of metal oxides including TiO2 ( Zardetto et al  2017 ; Ye et al  2016 )  ZnO ( Zardetto et al  2017 ; Ye et al  2016 )  SnO2 ( Zardetto et al  2017 ; Ye et al  2016 )  SiO2 ( Ye et al  2016 ) and ZrO2 ( Ye et al  2016 ) are suitable for the ETL where each has its own advantages  TiO2 and ZnO are widely studied and are showed great potential in practical application ( Zhao et al  2017 )  ZnO functions as an effective electron transport layer for several reasons  Firstly  its appropriate conduction band edge results in a greater built-in electric field which can be used to effectively enhance charge carrier transport  In addition  ZnO is also a very efficient hole blocking layer with its deep valence band maximum ( Wang et al  2014 )  ZnO has shown a great potential for solar cell application thanks to its remarkable properties  ZnO is a wide and direct bandgap ( Egap ~ 337 eV ) where the layer allows the whole visible range spectrum from the sunlight passing through and its large exciton binding energy ( ~ 60 meV ) leads to excitons that are stable at room temperature ( Son et al  2015 )  Recently  one-dimensional ( 1D ) ZnO nanomaterials  such as nanowires ( Hassanpour et al  2017 )  nanorods ( Wang 2004 )  nanobelts ( Wang 2004 ) and nanotubes ( Wang 2004 )  have been extensively studied because not only they have larger surface area which enlarges their contact surface  but also their higher length–width ratio that makes them easily to be filtered with upper materials ( Yin et al  2014 )  However  when these materials are used as ETL in perovskite solar cells  full coverage of perovskite layer is required to prevent a direct contact between ETL and HTL ( Ruankham et al  2011  2017 )  Another approach to avoid the energy loss is the fabrication of perovskite solar cells in planar structure  ZnO thin films with easy thickness control are one of the candidates for the planar structure  due to extremely low chance for the ETL/HTM direct contact  There are several methods for preparation of ZnO thin films ( Shen et al  2016 )  Different synthesis methods have been shown to affect the microstructures like size  morphology and orientation ( Mallick 2017 )  However  for compatibility with the use of flexible substrates  deposition process with temperature of lower than 160 °C is required  Among the proposed methods  sol–gel and hydrolysis–condensation are promising for this requirement  In addition  they are solution processable and hence are applicable for a large scale fabrication  Since the preparation methods affect the morphology of ZnO thin films in nanoscales  and the upper deposited perovskite layer  preparation conditions of these films should be optimized  In this work  two different methods for ZnO synthesis were investigated where thin film ZnO was prepared using sol–gel method and ZnO nanoparticles were obtained using hydrolysis–condensation technique  ZnO nanoparticles were dispersed using two types of solution  The ZnO thin films were carried out at low temperature and the photovoltaic performances and stability of the subsequent perovskite solar cells were investigated  2 Experimental details 21 Preparation of sol–gel ZnO thin films Indium-doped tin oxide ( ITO ) glass substrates with a sheet resistance of ~ 7 Ω/square were patterned using zinc powder and diluted HCl aqueous solution  After that  the substrate was successively washed in an ultrasonic bath using the alconox solution  distilled water  acetone and isopropanol  where each cleaning step takes approximately 30 min  Then  the residues were finally removed from the substrates using nitrogen flow and UV-ozone treatment for 30 min  A sol–gel ZnO thin film deposition was prepared using a 05 M solution of zinc acetate ( Sigma-aldrich ) with equivalent molar ratio of monoethanolamine ( MEA ) dissolving in 2-methoxyethanol  The solution was mixed at temperature of 60 °C for 2 h The precursor solution was coated onto the cleaned ITO glass using a spin coating technique at 3000 rpm for 30 s The gel films were subsequently dried using a hotplate at 160 °C for 30 min  22 Synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized by hydrolysis–condensation method following the literatures ( Ruankham et al  2013 )  A KOH solution in methanol ( 247 mg/ml ) was added dropwise into a zinc acetate dihydrate solution in methanol ( 246 mg/ml ) within 10 min under vigorous stir at 65 °C  The mixture was then kept at 65 °C for totally 135 min  After that  the colloidal solution was washed with methanol several times  The ZnO precipitate was then dispersed in two different mixture solvents ( A and B )  Solution A is a combination between chloroform and methanol with the ratio of 9:1 while solution B derives from the mixture of butanol  chloroform and methanol with the ratio of 14:1:1  The concentration of two solutions was kept at 6 mg/ml  Various number of ZnO nanoparticle layers were prepared where each layer was fabricated by spin coating the solution at 2000 rpm for 30 s and annealing at 160 °C for 10 min and the final ZnO nanoparticle layer was annealed at 160 °C for 30 min  23 Solar cell fabrication Normal structure perovskite solar cells were prepared in a N2-filled glove box with the relative humidity of lower than 20 %  Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM  Oscilla ) ( 10 mg/1 ml ) compact layer  dissolved in chlorobenzene ( CB  Sigma-Aldrich )  was coated on ZnO thin films using spin coater at the speed of 2000 rpm for 30 s and was dried at 70 °C for 5 min  Lead ( II ) iodide ( PbI2 ) ( 460 mg/1 ml ) was dissolved in dimethyformamide ( DMF ) ( both from Sigma-Aldrich ) and then 4-tert-butylpyridine ( 4-TBP  Oscilla ) ( 120 µl/1 ml ) was added in the solution  The PbI2 solution was then preheated at 70 °C for 5 min and was consequently spun on top of the PCBM layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s After that the layer was patterned by DMF and was annealed at 100 °C for 1 h After that methylammonium iodide ( MAI ) and formamidinium iodide ( FAI ) solution was prepared in different containers by separately blending 6 mg of MAI and 4 mg of FAI in 1 ml of isopropanol and the solution was stirred overnight at room temperature  The blended MAI and FAI solutions were spin coated on the PbI2 layer and was left for 40 s before spin coating at 2000 rpm for 30 s The sample was dried at 70 °C for 20 min in a glove box  Polythiophene ( P3HT  Osilla ) was dissolved in chlorobenzene ( 20 mg/1 ml ) and was consecutively added by acrylonitrile ( ACN  Sigma-Aldrich ) ( 16 µl )  4-TBP ( 8 µl ) and Co ( II ) -TFSI ( Oscilla ) ( 8 µl )  The solution was then spun on top of perovskite layer at 1000 rpm for 30 s To achieve a complete perovskite device  gold metal was thermally evaporated onto the P3HT film as a counter electrode  The structure of the device used in this work can be schematically shown in Fig  1  Fig  1 figure 1 The schematic structure of perovskite solar cell used in this work Full size image 24 Characterizations The solar simulator ( San-Ei Electric XES 301S ) was used to generate the sunlight at the intensity of 100 mW/cm2 ( AM 15 )  The current density–voltage ( J–V ) characteristics of the devices were examined upon the illumination of a simulated sunlight using a voltage source-meter ( 2400  Keithley instruments  UK )  The active area of solar cell was defined to 038 cm2 using shadow mask  The particle size of ZnO nanoparticles was observed by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM )  Morphology of the film surface was characterized using field emission scanning electron microscope ( FE-SEM  JEOL JSM-6335F )  Absorption spectra were obtained using UV–visible spectrophotometer ( UV–Vis  Covy–visible spectrophotometer )  Crystallinity of the materials was examined by X-ray diffractometer ( XRD ) ( Rigaku  MiniFlex ΙΙ )  Raman spectroscopy was also performed to investigate crystallinity and residues of ZnO thin films  3 Results and discussion 31 Crystallinity and morphology of ZnO thin films The crystallinity of ZnO nanoparticles was investigated by XRD analysis  Figure 2 shows the recorded XRD pattern of ZnO nanoparticles coated on ITO glass  The peaks of ZnO at ( 002 ) and ( 110 )  which correspond to the reflection planes of wurtzite structure  are observed  This confirms that ZnO crystal is formed on the substrate and is available for electron transport in perovskite solar cell  Note that XRD pattern of ZnO thin films prepared by sol–gel method could not be monitored since the film is relatively thin ( < 30 nm )  Fig  2 figure 2 XRD-patterns of zinc oxide nanoparticle on ITO-glass  The inset shows TEM images of ZnO nanoparticles with scale bar of 20 nm Full size image In addition  the particle size of ZnO nanoparticles  prepared by hydrolysis–condensation method  was examined using transmission electron microscope ( TEM ) as shown in the inset of Fig  2  It can be seen that ZnO nanoparticles have a relatively round particle shape with the approximate diameter of 10 nm  A uniform distribution of nanoparticles is observed throughout the sample with only a small area of ZnO lump  After the preparation of ZnO thin films on ITO coated glass  all samples were initially observed using a camera ( Fig  3a–c )  The difference of the film surface can be spotted by naked eyes  In addition  an optical microscope ( NUVOTECH model : E36 ) at the 40× magnification ( Fig  3e  f ) was also used to see the surface in detail  It can be seen that the ZnO thin film prepared from sol–gel method shows uncovered area on ITO substrate ( indicated by red circle in Fig  3d )  Moreover  the ZnO thin film from ZnO nanoparticles in solution A provides non-uniform thickness due to huge ZnO lumps ( indicated by red arrows in Fig  3e )  which may form in the solution state  These lumps obstruct the flow of liquid solution during spin coating of substrate  On the other hand  a small ZnO lump is also observed in the ZnO thin film from solution B ( Fig  3f )  but it seems to provide the optimal and homogeneous morphology  Fig  3

respectively  The red circles indicate uncovered ZnO area on ITO substrate and red arrows indicate huge ZnO lumps  ( Color figure online ) Full size image Analysis of Raman spectroscopy on ZnO samples  where the mode of molecular vibration is used to identify chemical composition  is shown in Fig  4  The peak of ZnO at 437 cm−1 ( Yang et al  2005 ) is visible for all sample  It can be noticed that the peak of the acetate group ( Zn ( CH3COO ) 2·2H2O ) at the frequency of 693 cm−1 ( Yang et al  2005 ) is observed for ZnO sample prepared by hydrolysis–condensation but the similar peak is absence in the dense sol–gel ZnO thin film  The peak of acetate group is caused by the incomplete reaction during ZnO nanoparticle preparation  It is noted that the rest of the peaks corresponds to the signature of the substrate  Fig  4 figure 4 Raman spectra of bare ITO substrate and ZnO thin films prepared by sol–gel method  spin coating of solution A  and solution B Full size image 32 Morphology and crystallinity of perovskite layer The morphology of MA06FA04PbI3 layer on ZnO thin films was also investigated by FE-SEM observation  The top and cross-sectional view FE-SEM images are demonstrated in Fig  5  The grain sizes of MA06FA04PbI3 on ITO/PCBM and ITO/ZnO ( sol–gel ) /PCBM substrates were comparable at approximately 240 nm and it is slightly smaller ( about 220 nm ) on ITO/ZnO ( solution A or B ) /PCBM substrate  The thickness of MA06FA04PbI3 layers in all cases is about 410 nm and that of the ZnO thin films is approximately 50–60 nm  Therefore  it is assumed to be no significant effects of grain size and thickness of perovskite layer on photovoltaic properties  Fig  5 figure 5 Top view FE-SEM images of perovskite MA06FA04PbI3 layer on a ITO/PCBM  b ITO/ZnO ( sol–gel ) /PCBM  c ITO/ZnO ( solution A ) /PCBM and d ITO/ZnO ( solution B ) /PCBM  Their corresponding histograms are shown in e–h  Cross-sectional FE-SEM image is represented in i Full size image XRD analysis was also performed to confirm the crystal formation of perovskite layers  The XRD patterns are shown in Fig  6  It is clearly seen that the peaks corresponding to the reflection of cubic perovskite lattices are observed at 136°  277°  314° ( Zhang et al  2017 ; Zheng et al  2017 ) and there is no characteristic peak of PbI2 at 128° ( JCPDS 07-0235 )  These peaks confirm the complete PbI2-to-perovskite transformation and no variation of perovskite structure from ETL substrates  even there is the acetate-group residue on the surfaces  Fig  6 figure 6 XRD spectra of perovskite MA06FA04PbI3 layers on various substrates with PCBM modification Full size image 33 Photovoltaic properties Various conditions of perovskite solar cell fabrication were carried out in this work and all photovoltaic properties are displayed in Fig  7 and are summarized in Table 1  Perovskite layer was coated on different ZnO conditions such as the number of dense ZnO thin film and the number of ZnO nanoparticle layers  The thickness of ZnO nanoparticle layer is directly proportional to the number of ZnO nanoparticle layer  Different solutions ( solution A and B ) for ZnO nanoparticle preparation also provide different thicknesses of ZnO layer  It is noted that the devices used in this work have comparable ZnO thickness at around 50–60 nm  For the device without ZnO thin film ( Device I )  its power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) is only 203 % with a relatively low fill factor ( FF ) of 028  In this device  perovskite/PCBM interface is used to collect photoelectron from the active layer and the electron transport to the ITO cathode then occurs through the PCBM layer  By inserting ZnO thin films  the higher PCEs are obtained  The highest PCE of 479 % is achieved from the device IV where ZnO thin film is prepared from solution B  The PCE of our device is higher than that reported in the literature with a similar nanoparticle diameter  Shibayama et al  ( 2017 ) have demonstrated that the efficiency of 119 % is achieved for the perovskite device using ZnO nanoparticle with the diameter of 7 nm  However  for the work using Li-doped spiro-OMeTAD as HTM  the PCE of 1460 % was reported ( Mahmud et al  2017 )  This is because Li-doped spiro-OMeTAD film provides high hole mobility and its highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) level is compatible to that of perovskite materials ( Kim et al  2012 )  On the other hand  perovskite solar cells with spiro-OMeTAD demonstrates a lower stability than the ones with P3HT ( Zhou et al  2018 )  Fig  7 figure 7 Current density–voltage ( J–V ) curves of perovskite solar cells fabricated in this work Full size image Table 1 Photovoltaic parameters of perovskite solar cells using different ETL substrates Full size table Short circuit current density ( Jsc )  open circuit voltage ( Voc )  and FF of device IV are all greater than those of the device II  The greater Jsc is probably due to the lower series resistance of ZnO nanoparticle film than dense sol–gel ZnO film as clearly demonstrated in Table 1  In addition  comparing with device III  it is possible that the device IV with more homogeneous ZnO thin film  as seen in Fig  3c  f  provides less probability of direct contact between ITO and perovskite layer  This corresponds to larger FF value and lower standard deviation of average PCE values  Perovskite solar cells with double ZnO layers were also fabricated to compare and to investigate their electrical and photovoltaic properties  After deposition of dense sol–gel ZnO thin films  ZnO nanoparticle thin films were coated using the same procedures and thickness control  It was found that the PCE and Jsc of device V and VI are lower than that of device IV  This may be also due to the high series resistance of dense ZnO layer as mention above  However  in comparison with device II  device V and IV provide higher Jsc  34 Stability These ZnO-based perovskite solar cells were stored under dark condition in a dedicator with controlled relative humidity at 40 % for 10 weeks and their photovoltaic parameters were evaluated on six consecutive weeks and spaced apart 2 weeks  The averaged PCEs were collected and their normalized PCEs were plotted in Fig  8  It can be seen that the PCEs of these devices increases slightly after storing for 2 weeks  The PCE of device VI reaches 5 % after storing it for 2 weeks  This behavior was found for the perovskite solar cells using P3HT as HTM ( Zhou et al  2018 )  Zhou et al  ( 2018 ) reported that atmospheric moisture settles down the interface between P3HT and perovskite layer  resulting in the improvement of PCE during the storage  However  since P3HT is a hydrophobic polymer  it is almost impossible for moisture to penetrate into the perovskite/P3HT interface  Another possible explanation is that charge carrier concentration increases upon the doping of P3HT by oxygen ( Schafferhans et al  2008 ; Meijer et al  2003 )  However  the detailed mechanism behind this PCE improvement is still unclear and further investigation on moisture effect is required  Fig  8 figure 8 Normalized PCE of the perovskite solar cells stored under dark condition at controlled relative humidity of 40 % for 10 weeks Full size image After reaching the maximum PCE in the 3rd week  the saturation of oxygen level in P3HT from moisture doping might occur and this might be responsible for P3HT oxidation which then leads to the PCE reduction of the device  At the 10th week  it is also seen that the device with a single ZnO nanoparticle layer fully degrades  This might be explained by moisture penetration via pores of this ZnO layer  since reaching the perovskite layer through P3HT side is proven to be very difficult for moisture due to the hydrophobic property of P3HT  On the other hand  the device II with dense ZnO layer shows about 40 % PCE reduction at the 10th week  Interestingly  the devices with double layers ( device V and VI ) provided better stability of PCE which is a very crucial point for practical applications  It is probably due the result of these double ZnO layers which may help to prevent a direct contact between perovskite and ITO  help to reduce the moisture penetration  and help to stabilize the perovskite solar cells  However  the effects of moisture upon device performances are still unclear  Further investigation on moisture infiltration via ETL or HTM should be addressed for real outdoor environment utilization  Modification of these layers to obtain moisture repellent film may be required  4 Conclusions Perovskite solar cells with ZnO thin film as electron transporting layer were fabricated at low temperature process  Homogeneous ZnO thin films can be obtained from sol–gel method and spin-coating of colloidal ZnO solution in mixture of 1-butanol  The highest PCE of 479 % in this work is achieved from the device using single ZnO layer from this colloidal ZnO solution  However  the device does not show good stability of PCE upon storing at a controlled relative humidity of 40 % for 10 weeks  The better stability perovskite solar cells are attained from the use of double dense-ZnO/nanoparticle-ZnO layers  The ease of fabrication and material availability is another advantage of this device which could lead to production cost reduction  To obtain a device with high efficiency and good stability  the conductivity of ZnO layers may be tuned via crystal modification but double layers of dense and nanoparticle films will still be used in the device  In addition  fabrication process of perovskite layer may be tuned to obtain pinhole-free and large-size perovskite morphology  This can be done by many methods reported by literatures  Finally  this research may help provide a method for preparing homogeneous ZnO thin films for stable perovskite solar cells and other optoelectronic devices  ReferencesIntroduction Last years have seen unprecedented growth of interest in perovskite solar cells based on organic—inorganic halides due to their distinct combination of high efficiency and easy preparation [ 123 ]  Impressive progress has been made in improving photovoltaic performance  The use of thin absorbent layers in solar energy conversion devices will lead to the real possibility of a durable and inexpensive replacement of solid silicon based devices  This work pursues the following purposes : 1 to present the results obtained by using ZnTe thin films as a hole transport layer in perovskite solar cells ; 2 to present the results obtained by using ZnTe powder as a dopant in solar cells  2 Experimental Details Lower contacts of solar cell were prepared from indium tin oxide ( ITO ) deposited by engraving on Corning 7059 glass  Subsequently  the thin layer of ZnTe which fulfilled hole transport layer function was deposited by thermal evaporation in vacuum  To measure the thickness of ZnSe thin films the interference microscope MII-4 ( Linnik type ) was used  For preparation of the bulk heterojunction layer  the methylammonium lead iodide ( MAPbI3 = CH3NH3PbI3 ) solution was used  As the transport electron layer  the PCBM = PC61BM ( fullerene derivative [ 66 ] -phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ) layer was used  The second type of solar cellsis different from the first type owing to the fact that as a hole transport layer in it was used film formed from the PEDOT-PSS solution ( poly ( 34-ethylenedioxythiophene ) poly ( styrene sulfonate ) ) doped with ZnTe powder  In the third variant of solar cells were deposited two layers with hole transport layer function  The first layer of ZnTe was obtained by thermal evaporation in quasi-closed volume under the same conditions as in the first variant of solar cells  The second layer of PEDOT-PSS was deposited by the spin-coating method  In the fourth variant of solar cells the bulk heterojonction layer was obtained by doping of the perovskite solution CH3NH3PbI3 with the ZnTe powder  The obtained solution and the other layers were deposited analogously to the first variant of solar cells  Current density-voltage experimental dependencies of devices were measured in a N2 filled glove box using simulated AM15G sun light which was calibrated to 100 mW/cm2 using an NREL traceable Si photodiode ( PV Measurements Inc ) and a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit controlled by a PC  The photovoltaic parameters of the multijunction solar cells were investigated at 300 K 3 Discussions In Fig  1 are presented the most representative curves of ZnTe—based of perovskite solar cells and all dependencies J-U were analyzed according to the layer thickness of ZnTe deposited on ITO  In Table 1 are presented photovoltaic parameters of the respective solar cells  Fig  1 figure 1 ZnTe—based perovskite solar cells Full size image Table 1 Photovoltaic parameters of ZnTe-based thin solar cells Full size table ITO/ZnTe/MAPbI3/PC61BM/Ag structure : For layer thickness of about d = 20 nm the ZTa1 functional curve was obtained with the following characteristics : open circuit voltage ( Voc ) of about 044 V  a short-circuit current ( Jsc ) of about 624 mA/cm−2 and a fill factor ( FF ) of 5948 %  corresponding a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 166 %  For the thickness layer of about d = 33 nm ( ZTa2 device ) curve hysteresis has increased up to the value of short-circuit current about 998 mA/cm−2  and open circuit voltage decreased to 039 V If the layer thickness increases up to d = 48 nm ( ZTa3 device )  the hysteresis of the J-U characteristic obtains the shape of the initial curve ( device ZTa1 )  ITO/PEDOT-PSS : ZnTe/MAPbI3/PC61BM/Ag structure : For devices with the concentration n = 12 mg/ml  the experimental curve ZTb1 was obtained with the following characteristics : open circuit voltage ( Voc ) of about 058 V  a short-circuit current ( Jsc ) of about 564 mA/cm2 and a fill factor FF ) of 4394 %  corresponding to a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 143 %  By increasing the concentration of ZnTe to n = 18 mg/ml we notice that the hysteresis of the curves is continuously increasing reaching up to a short-circuit current of about 927 mA/cm2 and an open circuit voltage of about 069 V  corresponding to a maximum PCE value of 256 %  If the concentration of ZnTe in PEDOP : PSS increases more than 18 mg/ml  the energy efficiency of solar cells decreases continuously  The hysteresis with the concentration n = 20 mg/ml is lower than in the previous cell  and energy efficiency decreases to 207 %  ITO/ZnTe/PEDOT : PSS/MAPbI3/PC61BM/Ag structure : For the device with ZnTe layer with a thickness d = 20 nm  the ZTc1 functional dependence was obtained with the following characteristics : Voc = 094 V  Jsc = 1273 mA/cm2  FF = 5987 % and PCE = 714 %  For the device with a ZnTe thickness of about d = 33 nm ( ZTc2 device ) the short circuit current value increased significantly to about 1916 mA/cm2 and the open circuit voltage decreased to 078 V If the thickness of the layer reaches the value d = 48 nm ( ZTa3 device )  the hysteresis decreases and the J-U characteristic moves upward  perpendicular to the current density axis  The respective devices showed a PCE > 7 %  which for ZnTe as the electron transport layer in perovskite solar cells is a breakthrough in solar photovoltaics  ITO/PEDOT-PSS/MAPbI3 : ZnTe/PC61BM/Ag structure : For a device with the concentration n = 12 mg/ml the ZTd1 curve has been obtained with the following characteristics : open circuit voltage ( Voc ) of about 095 V  a short-circuit current ( Jsc ) of about 1552 mA/cm2 and a fill factor ( FF ) of 6156 %  corresponding to a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 905 %  By increasing the concentration of ZnTe to n = 14 mg/ml we notice that the open circuit voltage practically remains constant and the hysteresis of the J-U curve increases to a short-circuit current value of about 2497 mA/cm2  corresponding to the maximum value of PCE = 1384 %  If the concentration of ZnTe in CH3NH3PbI3 increases more than at device ZTd2  the energy efficiency of solar cells decreases continuously as it decreases the Voc and FF values  4 Conclusions We believe that the successful use of ZnTe thin films ( and ZnTe-doped solutions ) in perovskite-based solar cells can extend to several inorganic semiconductor materials  including n-type semiconductors ( CdSe  ZnS  In2S3 etc )  The use of ZnTe thin films in various perovskite structures represents a scientific novelty in the fieldEnhancing the

solar cells–compositions for improved stability and power conversion efficiency Article 22 November 2023 Introduction Perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) based on organometallic perovskite materials have drawn more and more attentions because of the excellent power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) and solution preparation process  which can be attributed mainly to the superior properties of perovskite light absorption layer  such as high charge carrier mobility  ultralow trap density  and long electron–hole diffusion length [ 12345678910 ]  In particular  the PCE of PSCs rapidly increased to over 23 % in just a few years [ 11  12 ]  The promising of PSCs is also illustrated by the structural diversity [ 13  14 ] and convenient upscaling technology of perovskite layer [ 151617 ] and the easy integration of PSCs with other devices [ 18  19 ]  In general  inverted planar PSC has a multilayer structure including light-absorbing layer  hole transport layers ( HTL )  and electron transport layers ( ETL ) [ 20 ]  Charge carriers generated in the light-absorbing layer will dissociate at the interface with HTL or ETL  Therefore  the quality of the films and the interface contact between layers play a crucial role in the device performance [ 21 ]  For HTL layer  NiOx is more suitable for inverted planar PSCs than conventional HTL material poly ( 34-ethylenedioxythiophene ) polystyrene sulfonate ( PEDOT : PSS ) because of the higher open-circuit voltage ( VOC ) of the obtained PSCs [ 22  23 ]  However  the performance of NiOx-based PSC still has a lot of room to improve due to the relatively low short-circuit current density ( JSC ) [ 242526 ]  At present  solution preparation process based on NiOx nanoparticles is a popular method to prepare NiOx HTL  In general  however  there are many defects on the surface of the obtained NiOx film  which has bad effect on the quality of the perovskite film and the performance of PSCs  Fortunately  the morphology of the perovskite layer and its contact with NiOx can be improved by modifying the surface of NiOx  which is an effective method to enhance the performance of PSCs [ 272829 ]  For example  perovskite film fabricated on the polymeric PTAA-modified NiOx had larger grain size and better crystallinity [ 24 ] ; after passivating the surface of NiOx using a self-assembled dye molecule monolayer  its contact with the perovskite layer was improved because of the suppressed interfacial recombination [ 30 ] ; the surface defects of the NiOx layer was passivated by 4-bromobenzoic acid  leading to the reduction of energy level offsets between NiOx and perovskite layers [ 31 ]  Previously reported interface modification materials are mostly toxic materials  However  the use of environmentally friendly non-toxic materials is particularly important to human ecological environment  In this work  edible materials glycerol and choline chloride were used as the interface materials between NiOx and NH3CH3PbI3 ( MAPbI3 )  MAPbI3 film fabricated on the modified NiOx has smoother surface and more uniform grains  leading to an enhancement of PCE from 1337 to 1525 % because of the increase in JSC from 1777 to 2035 mA cm−2  The mechanism investigation suggested that the enhancement of surface wettability of NiOx after glycerol and choline chloride modification plays an important role in the morphology improvement in MAPbI3 film  Our work provides a new and more environmentally friendly choice for interface modification  Experimental details Materials and solution PbI2 ( 9999 % ) and MAI were purchased from P-OLED  Choline chloride was purchased from TCI  γ-butyrolactone ( GBL )  DMSO  acetone  glycerol  and isopropanol were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich  All the above-mentioned materials were used as received without further treatment  NiOx powder was synthesized in our lab according to Ref  [ 32 ] and was dispersed in deionized water with a concentration of 20 mg mL−1  MAPbI3 precursor solution was composed of 14 M of PbI2 and CH3NH3I ( 1:1/n : n ) in DMSO and GBL ( 7:3/v : v )  Before spin coating  the MAPbI3 precursor solution was stirred at 66 °C for 24 h in N2 atmosphere glove box  Glycerol  choline chloride  and the mixture of them were used to modify the surface of NiOx film by spin coating their solution in isopropanol ( 1 mg mL−1 )  respectively  Preparation of perovskite solar cells Inverted PSCs were prepared with device configuration of glass/ITO/NiOx ( 25 nm ) /MAPbI3 ( 380 nm ) / [ 66 ] -phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM  65 nm ) /bathocuproine ( BCP  10 nm ) /Ag ( 100 nm )  First  the ITO-coated glass ( 15 × 15 cm2 ) substrate was sequentially cleaned under ultrasonic with deionized water  acetone  and ethyl alcohol  20 min for each  Following  4-min UV ozone treatment was applied after it was dried by N2 flow  Then  NiOx film was deposited onto ITO by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s followed by annealing at 130 °C for 10 min under atmospheric conditions  After transferring the ITO/NiOx substrate into N2 atmosphere glove box  the isopropanol solution of glycerol  choline chloride  and glycerol/choline chloride were spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s  respectively  Then  MAPbI3 precursor solution was spin-coated  Specifically  the spin-coating process was composed of two stages : 1000 rpm for 15 s and then 4000 rpm for 25 s For toluene washing during the spin coating of MAPbI3 precursor solution  at delay time of 16 s from the beginning of the second stage  600 μL of toluene was dripped  After being thermally annealed at 100 °C for 10 min  PCBM solution in chlorobenzene ( 30 mg mL−1 ) was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 30 s Finally  10-nm-thick BCP and 100-nm-thick Ag were sequentially thermally evaporated at a basic pressure of 3 × 10−4 Pa  The active area defined by a shadow mask was 0077 cm2  In order to verify the reliability of the experimental data  different batches of devices were made and tested  Characterization The current density–voltage ( J–V ) curves were collected by a Keithley 2602 source meter under illumination of 1 sun ( 100 mW cm2 AM 15 G ) provided by a solar simulator ( Oriel/Newport  model 94043 A  USA )  which was calibrated with a Si photodiode  The scan voltage step size was 001715 V The surface morphology of MAPbI3 films was investigated by using a Hitachi S4800 scanning electron microscope ( SEM )  The microscopic surface morphology measurements were conducted by a Bruker Icon Dimension Atomic Force Microscope ( AFM )  X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) patterns were collected by a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer  The absorption spectra were measured by a UV–Vis spectrophotometer ( UV3600 )  Incident photon-to-current efficiency ( IPCE ) data were collected by using a QTest Station1000  The hydrophilicity of NiOx film was tested with a contact angle machine ( KRUSS DSA20  Germany )  The thicknesses of the NiOx  MAPbI3  and PCBM films were determined by using a Bruker DektakXT Stylus Profiler  The electrical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS ) measurements were conducted by a Wayne Kerr 6500B analyzer  whose spectra were fitted by using software ZView 310  All the above measurements were carried out in atmosphere  and the devices were not encapsulated  Results and discussion Inverted PSCs with the device configuration of ITO/NiOx ( 25 nm ) /MAPbI3 ( 380 nm ) /PCBM ( 65 nm ) /BCP ( 10 nm ) /Ag ( 100 nm ) were fabricated  as shown in Fig  1  The modification of NiOx by glycerol  choline chloride  and glycerol/choline chloride ( 1:1/w : w ) were performed by spin coating their isopropanol solution on top of NiOx  respectively  Figure 1 figure 1 Device configuration of inverted perovskite solar cells Full size image Figure 2a shows the current density–voltage ( J–V ) characteristics of the devices with and without modification  The detailed performance values of PSCs are summarized in Table 1  The experimental error values were obtained by minus the average value and then divided by 2  The champion control device without modification exhibited a PCE of 1337 ± 032 %  with a VOC of 103 ± 001 V  a JSC of 1777 ± 018 mA cm−2 and a fill factor ( FF ) of 728 ± 274 %  After treating NiOx by glycerol  the JSC increased to 1909 ± 055 mA cm−2  and both the VOC and FF were nearly unchanged  leading to an improved PCE of 1402 ± 057 %  The PSC based on NiOx treated by choline chloride showed an increased JSC ( 1899 ± 023 mA cm−2 ) and a decreased FF ( 6732 ± 201 % )  resulting in a slight decrease in PCE to 1298 %  However  after being treated by glycerol/choline chloride ( 1:1/w : w )  the JSC increased greatly to 2035 ± 036 mA cm−2  leading to a high PCE of 1525 ± 040 %  Obviously  the mixture of glycerol/choline chloride ( 1:1/w : w ) treatment has the best effect on improving the PCE of PSC because of the enhancement of JSC  which can be further confirmed by the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) data given in Fig  2b  The integrated current density ( Jin ) values of the devices before and after treating by glycerol/choline chloride ( 1:1/w : w ) were 1704 and 1877 mA cm−2  respectively  which were in good agreement with the JSC values from J–V scan  The device performance statistics are shown in Fig  S1  which demonstrated good reproducibility of PSCs  According to the average performance values of multiple devices  the error of the values was obtained  respectively  Figure 2 figure 2 J–V curves ( a ) and IPCE data together with calculated JSC values ( b ) of the champion PSCs based on NiOx with or without modification Full size image Table 1 Summary of the detailed performance parameters of PSCs Full size table As well known  the morphology of perovskite film plays an important role in the performance of PSCs [ 33  34 ]  In order to understand the reason for the enhancement of JSC after glycerol and choline chloride treatment  scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) images of perovskite film before and after treatment were carried out  as shown in Fig  3  The crystal sizes were analyzed by using Nano Measurer  and the statistical values are summarized in Table 2  The corresponding column chart of grain-size distribution is shown in Fig  S2  It is found that the MAPbI3 film fabricated on NiOx with and without treatment shows a significant difference in grain size and uniformity  The mean crystal size values of MAPbI3 films on pristine NiOx without modification and with modification by glycerol  choline chloride  and glycerol/choline chloride ( 1:1/w : w ) were 200  260  160  and 190 nm  respectively  Though the perovskite film with glycerol/choline chloride ( 1:1/w : w ) modification has a similar crystal size with that of the pristine film  it has the smallest variance value of grain-size distribution  indicating the most uniform grains  According to the previous reports  small but uniform perovskite crystal is better than the large non-uniform one in terms of charge carrier transportation in PSC [ 35  36 ]  That is why the PSC based on glycerol/choline chloride-treated NiOx has a higher PCE value than that of the PSC based on NiOx treated with glycerol  However  choline chloride treatment resulted in a decreased PCE of PSC even though it had more uniform grains  It was caused by the obvious decrease in grain size after choline chloride treatment  which contained more grain boundaries  leading to larger series resistance ( Rs )  as summarized in Table 1  Figure 3 figure 3 SEM images of perovskite films fabricated on top of NiOx  a pristine film without treatment  b with glycerol treatment  c with choline chloride treatment  d with glycerol/choline chloride treatment Full size image Table 2 Summary of crystal size values of perovskite films based on NiOx with and without modification Full size table In order to confirm the variation of MAPbI3 crystal size after treatment  X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) patterns were collected  as shown in Fig  4  Two clear diffraction peaks at 2θ = 1397° and 283° were observed  which were the typical diffraction peaks of cube MAPbI3 crystal corresponding to the ( 110 ) and ( 220 ) planes  respectively  However  the full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) values of the most intense peak at 1398° changed after treatment  The FWHM values for the MAPbI3 films without and with modification by glycerol  choline chloride  and glycerol/choline chloride were 0111°  0103°  0113°  and 0108°  respectively  According to the Scherer Formula [ 37 ]  large crystal size results in narrow FWHM values  Therefore  MAPbI3 films with modification by glycerol have the largest crystal sizes  which is in agreement with SEM images  Figure 4 figure 4 XRD patterns of perovskite films on NiOx film with and without modification Full size image To further understand the morphology influence on the performance of PSC  the atomic force microscope ( AFM ) images of perovskite films were obtained  as shown in Fig  5  The pristine perovskite film has a root-mean-square ( rms ) value of 960 nm  The rms roughness value of perovskite films modified by glycerol  choline chloride  and glycerol/choline chloride was 877 nm  717 nm  and 856 nm  respectively  indicating a smoother surface after modification  PSC based on perovskite with smooth surface has a few defects  which can inhibit the recombination occurring at the perovskite/ETL interface [ 38 ] and thus contribute to the enhancement of JSC [ 39  40 ]  Figure 5 figure 5 AFM images of perovskite films fabricated on top of NiOx  a pristine film without treatment  b with glycerol treatment  c with choline chloride treatment  d with glycerol/choline chloride mixture treatment Full size image To investigate the interface recombination  electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS ) measurements were carried out and the Nyquist plots are shown in Fig  6  The Nyquist plots demonstrate the combination of semicircles of the complex plane  It can reflect the charge recombination within the perovskite film and at the interface with ETL and HTL  which is often described by the recombination resistance ( Rrec )  The Rrec for devices can be extracted by fitting the plots using the circuit shown in inset of Fig  6  A high Rrec represents less recombination and efficient dissociation of carriers at interfaces  It can be found that the PSC based on glycerol/choline chloride mixture-treated NiOx had a higher Rrec than that of the control device  indicating the depressed recombination at the interface  Figure 6 figure 6 Nyquist plots ( under a voltage of 1 V in dark ) of the control device and device based on glycerol/choline chloride-treated NiOx Full size image Time-resolved photoluminescence ( TRPL ) measurements of perovskite/NiOx films were studied to investigate the charge carrier dynamics  The TRPL spectra are shown in Fig  7  from which the charge carrier lifetime can be calculated  After glycerol/choline chloride treatment  the charge carrier lifetime was 1998 ns  which was lower than that of the control sample ( 4748 ns )  indicating the faster transfer of photogenerated holes from perovskite to HTL [ 41  42 ]  which contributes to the improvement in JSC  Figure 7 figure 7 TRPL of the perovskite/NiOx films Full size image The above experimental results demonstrate that perovskite film fabricated on treated NiOx had more uniform grains and smooth surface  Therefore  the charge carrier transfer was improved  and the recombination at the interface between perovskite and ETL and HTL was depressed  leading to the enhancement of JSC of PSC  To investigate the reason for the morphology enhancement of perovskite films  the wettability of perovskite precursor solution on the surface of NiOx was measured by dropping its solvent ( DMSO and GBL  7:3/v : v ) on NiOx  The contact angles of the solvent on the surface of NiOx with and without treatment are shown in Fig  8  After glycerol and glycerol/choline chloride treatment  the contact angle decreased to 41° and 56°  respectively  compared with that on the pristine NiOx film ( 151° )  The improvement in wettability of NiOx is mainly due to the effect of hydroxyl groups  which is beneficial to the deposition of MAPbI3 and thus good morphology [ 30  43  44 ]  Figure 8 figure 8 Contact angles of the solvents of perovskite precursor solution on NiOx  a pristine film  b with glycerol treatment  c with choline chloride treatment  d with glycerol/choline chloride treatment Full size image The surface morphology of NiOx films was also studied by using AFM  as shown in Fig  S3  All the NiOx films with and without modification show a similar morphology  The rms roughness value of the pristine NiOx films was 677 nm  which was 680 nm  687 nm  and 681 nm for the NiOx films modified by glycerol  choline chloride  and glycerol/choline chloride  respectively  It indicated that the surface roughness values of NiOx films were almost unchanged  Conclusion Editable materials like glycerol  choline chloride  and glycerol/choline chloride were used to modify the surface of NiOx  Glycerol treatment increased the grain size of perovskite film  while choline chloride treatment improved the uniformity of perovskite grain size and the surface roughness of perovskite film  After treating with glycerol/choline chloride  perovskite film with large and uniform grains and smooth surface was obtained  Therefore  the lifetime of charge carriers was improved  suggesting a decrease in defects in perovskite films  leading to the enhancement in JSC of PSC  A 14 % enhancement of PCE was achieved  The enhanced morphology of the perovskite mainly attributes to the improvement in surface wettability of NiOxbstract Perovskite-type materials are oxide compounds with a growing interest in different disciplines because of the wide range of ions and valences that can be tailored in a simple structure  resulting in

Perovskite materials have been extensively studied since past decades due to their interesting capabilities such as electronic conductivity  superconductivity  magnetoresistance  dielectric  ferroelectric  and piezoelectric properties [ 1  2 ]  Perovskite materials are known for having the structure of the CaTiO3 compound and have the general formula close or derived from ABO3  Interestingly  perovskite materials can accommodate around 90 % of metallic elements of the periodic table at positions A and/or B  maintaining the characteristic perovskite structure  This fact is incredibly advantageous for creating various combinations and allows obtaining compounds with a wide range of properties due to the complete or partial substitutions of cations [ 3 ]  Perovskite materials have been widely explored in applications related to their electrical  optical  and magnetic properties  They have been also used for the control of environmental pollution due to their thermal stability and catalytic properties  Other applications include sensing and adsorption of various aqueous and gas-phase species  In the field of electrochemistry  these materials have been employed as electrodes in rechargeable batteries and fuel cells [ 4 ]  Specific examples of perovskite materials in engineering applications are EuTiO3 and CaMnO3 for energy-harvesting devices [ 5 ]  doped LaFeO3 and LaCoO3 for solid oxide fuel cells [ 6 ]  doped BaSrO3 and BaFeO3 for oxygen membrane separation [ 7  8 ]  SmFeO3 and LaMnO3 for gas sensing [ 9  10 ]  and NaTaO3 and LaTiO3 for photocatalytic cells [ 11  12 ]  Due to its properties  perovskite materials have also called the attention of researchers for battery applications  For instance  the LaFeO3 compound has been studied as negative electrode material for nickel–metal hydride ( Ni/MH ) batteries [ 13 ]  Other applications include perovskites as negative electrodes in Li–ion and Li–air batteries [ 4  14 ]  The present chapter is focused on reviewing perovskite materials for battery applications and introduce to the main concepts related to this field  11 Perovskite Structure Perovskite materials took their name from the mineral called Perovskite ( CaTiO3 )  which was discovered by Gustav Rose in Russia in 1839 [ 15 ]  Ideal perovskite oxides present a crystal cubic structure with space group Pnma ( Pm3−m cubic system ) described by the general formula ABO3  where A is a rare or alkaline earth metal and B is a first-row transition metal [ 16 ]  In this structure  cations with a large ionic radius coordinate to 12 oxygen atoms and reside in A-sites  while cations with a smaller ionic radius coordinate 6 atoms and reside in B-sites  Fig  1  Fig  1 figure 1 Schematic representation of the ABO3 perovskite-type structure Full size image According to the Goldschmidt ’ s tolerance_factor ( t )  which is an indicator for the stability and distortion of crystal structures and is defined by t = ( rA + rO ) /√2 ( rB + rO ) ( where rA  rB  and rO are the average ionic radiuses of A  B  and O atoms )  the perovskite structure results most stable when t is close to the unit  that is  when it forms a cubic structure  When t has deviation from the unit  the crystal structure tends to change from cubic to rhombohedral  orthorhombic  hexagonal  tetragonal  and monoclinic structures  depending on the deviation the from Goldschmidt ’ s tolerance_factor  Overall  perovskites form in the interval from 075 to 1 [ 17 ]  Hundreds of compounds are known for presenting the perovskite structure  for instance  the FeMgSiO3 called bridgmanite is one of the most abundant perovskite compounds in the earth [ 18 ]  Other types of perovskites are also found in the nature  For example  the Sr3Ti2O7 is a layered perovskite compound  which is a common material in rocks [ 19 ]  Layered perovskites are usually a variation from ideal cubic perovskites  Especially  layered perovskites present a double-perovskite structure  that is  the unit cell is twice the unit cell of a conventional perovskites  They are formed by slabs of ABO3 structure  which are separated by a secondary structure  The differentiating features for the layered perovskites are the type of secondary structure that separate the ABO3 layers and the offsetting of the layers [ 20 ]  Three different basic layered perovskite structures are distinguished : ( 1 ) Dion–Jacobson-type structures  ( 2 ) Perovskite-like layered structures ( PLS )  and ( 3 ) hexagonal-type structures  They are formed by cutting the cubic perovskite structure across the ( 100 )  ( 110 )  ( 111 ) planes and by insertion of additional oxygen atoms  These structures have the following general formulas : A ’ An-1BnO3n+1  AnBnO3n+2  and AnBn-1O3n  respectively  where n represents the number of BO6 octahedra that span one layer  and therefore specifies the thickness of the perovskite layer  In this structure  alkaline earth or lanthanide metals usually are located on the A positions  while the B cations are often niobium or titanium [ 20  21 ]  Among the three different basic perovskite layered structures  the AnBnO3n+2 PSL family has attracted most attention for technological applications due to their interesting ferroelectric and electrochemical properties [ 22 ]  In particular  perovskite layered oxides have been used as electrodes and materials for catalysis in metal–air  Li–ion  and Ni–MH batteries  12 Preparation Methods Several synthesis methods for the production of perovskite oxides are reported in open literature available [ 23 ]  Three main methods are distinguished among the several studies carried out in the field of batteries ; these methods are the glycine–nitrate method  the solid-state reaction route  and the sol–gel technique [ 24 ]  The glycine–nitrate method involves the use of nitrates instead of oxides as precursors  nitric or stearic acid as dispersant  and glycine as fuel  Precursors  dispersant  and fuel are all mixed in distilled water and heated until the excess free water evaporates  Afterward  the resulting viscous liquid is autoignited by placing it in a preheated plate  which is then calcined at a temperature of about 1200 K for 3–5 h [ 25 ]  Several authors have used this method to obtain perovskite powders for battery applications  For example  Wang et al  [ 26 ] employed the glycine nitrate method to prepare ABO3 perovskite-type oxide to built-up negative electrodes for Ni/MH batteries  They used stearic acid ( C17H35COOH ) as both solvent and dispersant  In addition  they employed analytical grade precursors in stoichiometric amounts including the La ( NO3 ) 36H2O and Fe ( NO3 ) 39H2O  The mixture was stirred by a magnetic mixer until a homogeneous solution was produced  The solution was ignited in air and the powders obtained were used as feedstock powder for the production of negative electrodes for Ni–MH batteries  It is worth mentioning that other investigations add a final step of calcination at 1123 K to favor the development of the perovskite-type structure  Alternatively  in the solid-state reaction route  the mechanical mixing of high purity precursor oxides ( 99 % purity ) and carbonates or salts is followed by heating at temperatures of about 1500 K The solid-state reaction route is often performed for 8–24 h  which allows the rearrangement of cations and favors the formation of the perovskite-type structure [ 27 ]  The reactions are usually presented at the interface of the mixed solids as ions diffuse from the bulk to the interface between particles  As a final step  the sintered material is often milled to obtain micrometric powders that subsequently are used to produce electrodes for batteries  Another common synthesis method for the production of perovskite-type oxides is the sol–gel method  In particular  the sol–gel “ Pechini ” method is very common for the preparation of perovskite-type compounds [ 28 ]  The Pechini method involves the mixing of precursors ( nitrates and/or oxides ) by the addition of a chelating agent  ethylene glycol as the sol-forming product  desiccation  and calcination  Previous studies involving the usage of perovskite oxides for battery applications have reported the synthesis of ABO3 perovskite-type powders by means of the Pechini method  For example  Song et al  [ 29 ] prepared LaCrO3 starting from a mixture of La ( NO3 ) 36H2O  Cr ( NO3 ) 39H2O  citric acid  and ethylene glycol  These reagents were then dissolved in distilled water to form an aqueous solution and then stirred in a water bath at 353 K until a gel was formed  The gel was then desiccated in a dying oven at 353 K for 24 h The gel obtained was ground and calcined at 1073 K for 2 h to form the final powders  Overall  the sol–gel method is usually employed when small particle size is required  The sol–gel method allows the preparation of nanometric size powder while keeping homogeneous composition  This fact makes very attractive this method for the battery applications where diffusional and kinetic processes depend on the surface area of materials involved and its chemical composition  Alternatively  the solid-state reaction route is considered a high-temperature process that allows the preparation of micrometric powders  Comparing with the glycine–nitrate route and the sol–gel technique  the solid-state reaction route requires higher calcination temperatures and longer calcination times to yield pure crystals of oxides  As an example  in the present book chapter  a layered perovskite-type oxide Nd2Ti2O7 ( Neodymium Titanate ) with general formula AnBnO3n+2 for text { n } = 4 was synthesized by means of the sol–gel route  Tetrabutyl titanate ( Ti ( OBu ) 4 ) and Nd2O3 were used as the precursors of Ti and Nd  The molar ratio of Nd/Ti was fixed at 1/1 and the amount of citric acid used was determined by nCitricAcid/ ( nNd + nTi ) = 2  Nd2O3 ( 0005 mol ) was dispersed in a spot of water  and then 5 mL concentrated HNO3 was added to it drop by drop to dissolve the rare earth oxide  Citric acid ( 004 mol ) was dissolved in 5 mL H2O and then poured into the solution  The mixture was thoroughly stirred by the magnetic mixer  Then  the appropriate amount of Ti ( OBu ) 4 ( 001 mol ) was added with vigorous stirring  The solution was placed in a 60 ℃ liquid bath to vaporize water during 05 h After 5 h  the mixture solution changed from colorless solution to pink solution and then to violet gel  see Fig  2  The gel was then take out and calcined at 850 ℃ for 2 h in air  Fig  2 figure 2 Synthesis route for the gel precursor Full size image In order to confirm the manufacturing temperature of the Nd2Ti2O7 powder  DSC–TGA curves of the gel precursor were evaluated on the DSC–TGA–SDT Q600 thermal analysis instrument in ambient air and calefactive velocity of 20 ℃/min as shown in Fig  3  The DSC–TGA curve reveals the formation of four peaks  The first exothermic peak ( 90–125 ℃ ) with relatively large weight loss ( 27 % ) is caused by the evaporation and burning of the organic substance  The second exothermic peak ( 360 ℃ ) is attributed to the combustion of remaining organic substance and the third exothermic peak ( 514 ℃ ) is related to the crystal lattice energy released during the formation of perovskite-type structure  The last exothermic peak is from the final formation of Nd2Ti2O7  The measured overall weight loss is 7726 %  which indicates the complete removal of all the citric acid and all the organic substance  No further weight loss was above 815 ℃  suggesting that the Nd2Ti2O7 can be fabricated at about 815 ℃  Fig  3 figure 3 DSC–TGA analysis of the gel precursor Full size image The crystal structure of the calcined neodymium titanate powder was analyzed by X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) using a specular reflection mode ( Bruker D8 Advanced  Cu Ka radiation  k = 0154056 nm ) over the angular range of 20° < Ɵ < 80° with a step size of 0008° and measuring time of 300 s per step  Figure 4 shows the XRD patterns of Nd2Ti2O7  This pattern confirms the high crystallinity of the product  The XRD pattern is quite consistent to a single phase of layered perovskite Nd2Ti2O7 and is indexed based on a monoclinic structure ( text { a } = 76951494 Å  text { b } = 13044494 Å  text { c } = 54716635 Å y β = 9891025 ) ( CIF-2237725 )  These results suggest that the Nd2Ti2O7-layered perovskite oxide  which usually forms at high temperature in conventional method ( 1100 ℃ ) with a long reaction time ( 50 h )  can be successfully synthesized at a relatively low temperature ( 815 ℃ ) with shortened reaction time ( 2 h ) by using sol–gel  Fig  4 figure 4 XRD analysis of the Nd2Ti2O7 powder obtained Full size image The morphology and particle size distribution of the calcined powder was also studied by means of Scanning Electron Microscopy ( SEM ) and by using a laser diffraction equipment ( LS1057083 Laser Diffraction  Malvern Instruments )  The results of morphology and particle size analysis are presented in Fig  5  These results reveal that irregular particles were obtained  which formed agglomerates of small nanometric powders  The agglomerates presented a mean particle diameter of 3601 μm  Fig  5 figure 5 SEM images of the calcined Nd2Ti2O7 powder and particle size distribution analysis Full size image Usually  the perovskite-type oxide powders obtained by any of the methods described in the present section are further processed to build up electrodes or bulk parts that are intended to be used in batteries  In the next section  specific applications of perovskites in batteries will be discussed  2 Perovskite Materials in Batteries Open literature suggests that perovskite-type oxides have been often studied for applications in metal–air ( Li–air  Al–air  Zn–air ) [ 30  31 ]  Li–ion  and Ni–metal hydride ( Ni–MH ) batteries [ 32  46 ]  To understand the usage of perovskites in the different battery technologies  a brief description of the operation of these technologies is presented in this section  One of the battery technologies linked to numerous reports of the usage of perovskite-type oxides is the metal–air technology  The operation of a metal–air battery is associated with the metal oxidation at the anode  while an oxygen reduction reaction occurs at the air-breathing cathode during discharge  Catalysis particles are often used on the surface of the air diffusion cathode  which reduces the O2 from the surrounding air  Typically  these types of batteries use an aqueous or an aprotic electrolyte  The reactions in a metal–air battery can be described by the following equations [ 31 ] : begin { aligned } { text { Anode } } : { text { M } } leftrightarrow { text { M } } ^ { n + } + { text { ne } } ^ { - } hfill  { text { Cathode } } : { text { O } } _ { 2 } + { text { ne } } ^ { - } + { text { 2H } } _ { 2 } { text { O } } leftrightarrow { text { 4OH } } ^ { - } hfill  left ( { { text { Forward } } : { text { charge } } ; { text { Reverse } } : { text { discharge } } } right ) hfill  end { aligned } ( 1 ) where M presents the metal and n is the oxidation number of the metal ion  The metal anodes are often alkali metals ( eg  Li  K  and Na )  alkaline earth metals ( eg  Mg )  or first-row transition metals ( eg  Fe and Zn ) with good electrochemical equivalence ; the air-breathing cathode often has an open porous architecture that allows continuous oxygen supply from surrounding air  Alternatively  the Li–ion battery technology has been another opportunity field for the usage of perovskite materials  The operating principle of a Li–ion cell is based on the reversible exchange of lithium ions between the positive and negative electrodes  throughout the cycles of charge ( positive delithiation ) and discharge ( positive lithiation )  Each of the electrodes is made of materials that can be inserted or detached by lithium ions in their crystalline structure ; these are called “ active materials ” or “ intercalation materials ” During its use ( cell in discharge )  the negative electrode ( site of an oxidation reaction ) releases lithium ions which migrate through the electrolyte ( ions conductor ) ; these ions are inserted in the crystal lattice of the active material at the positive electrode ( site of a reduction reaction )  The passage of each lithium–ion by the internal circuit of the battery is exactly compensated by the passage of an electron in the external circuit to maintain electrical neutrality in each of the electrodes  thereby generating an electric current  During the charge  the cell operation is exactly the reverse process ; in that case  external energy is necessary to reverse the reaction in electrodes  The reactions in a Li–ion battery can be described by the following equations [ 33 ] : begin { aligned } { text { Cathode } } : { text { Li } } - { text { XXO } } _ { n } leftrightarrow { text { Li } } _ { 1- y } { text { XXO } } _ { n } + { text { Li } } ^ { + } + { text { ye } } ^ { - } hfill  { text { Anode } } : { text { C } } + { text { yLi

right ) hfill  end { aligned } ( 2 ) where X represents a metal and n is the number of oxygen in the oxide compound  Some examples of materials used as cathodes are LiCoO2  LiFePO4  and LiMn2O4  At the anode  the most common materials are carbons ( graphite  coke  or hard carbon ) and lithium titanate [ 34 ]  Another battery technology involving the usage of perovskite materials is the Ni–MH or Ni–oxide  This technology consists of a positive electrode ( cathode ) which experiences +2/+3 oxidation state change promoted by the electrochemical reaction during charge  Protons released from the cathode recombine with hydroxide ions in the electrolyte  In the anode  a hydrogen storage compound is in charge of storing hydrogen in a reversible way  During charge  the applied voltage splits water molecules into hydroxide ions and hydrogen protons  Consequently  the reduction of water permits hydrogen protons to be in contact with the hydrogen storage alloy  Protons enter then into the bulk of the alloy to form a hydride driven by the voltage and diffusion caused by the concentration gradient  The reactions in a Ni–MH battery can be described by the following equations [ 46 ] : begin { aligned } { text { Cathode } } : { text { xNi } } left ( { text { OH } } right ) _ { 2 } + { text { OH } } -   leftrightarrow { text { NiOOH } } + { text { xH } } _ { 2 } { text { O } } hfill

{ text { charge } } ; { text { Reverse } } : { text { discharge } } } right ) hfill  end { aligned } ( 3 ) where M represents an intermetallic or an oxide compound  The most common materials used at the cathode and anode are Ni ( OH ) 2 and LaNi5  respectively  Perovskite oxides have been widely studied as catalysis materials for Li–air batteries [ 36  37 ]  In Li–air batteries  it is essential to catalyze the charge and discharge reactions in order to reduce kinetic losses because of breaking and forming of the O–O bond at the air-breathing cathode [ 35 ]  There is a growing interest in employing perovskite oxides in Li–air batteries due to their capacity to promote oxygen reduction ( ORR ) and oxygen evolution reaction ( OER ) and excellent catalytic performance [ 38  39 ]  In fact  perovskite materials have been widely used as catalysts for fuel cells  Overall  perovskite oxides provide good catalytic performance when the structure in the B-site has a single electron-filled  and therefore  provides the favorable bond energy of M–O bond for the ORR and OER  One example of a perovskite oxide used as catalytic compound in Li–air batteries is the LaNiO3 [ 40 ]  Some studies have suggested that both B-site and/or A-site doping on LaNiO3 can be beneficial for catalytic properties  For example  Du et al  [ 41 ] prepared perovskite oxide nanoparticles by means of the sol–gel route  They synthesized LaNiO3  LaNi092Mg008O3  and LaNi085Mg015O3  Especially  the LaNi085Mg015O3 presented the highest catalytic activity among the compound studied  Overall  the improved OER activities of perovskites are related to the high covalency of transition metal–oxygen bonds  Doping the B position is then beneficial for the transition metal–oxygen covalency  which favors the catalytic behavior in perovskites  Other examples of perovskites in Li–air batteries are Sr095Ce005CoO3-d and the La17Ca03Ni075Cu025O4 with a layered perovskite structure  which exhibit high catalytic activity toward electrochemical Li2O2 oxidation in aqueous and a nonaqueous aprotic electrolyte  respectively [ 42  43 ]  Perovskite materials have been also studied as cathode material for the Li–ion battery technology [ 32 ]  In Li–ion batteries  cathode materials with both high ionic and high electronic conductivities are required for large energy density  Most of the cathode materials used in rechargeable Li–ion batteries possess hexagonal-layered structure or spinel structure and are usually poor electronic conductors [ 35 ]  Perovskite oxides have called the attention of researchers because their electronic properties can be controlled by doping A- or B-sites  In addition  due to the different atomic sizes in the A- and B-sites and different valence states that can be obtained  the perovskite materials can act as materials for the intercalation and deintercalation of Li–ions during the charge and discharge processes  Examples of perovskite oxides studied as cathode materials for Li–ion batteries are La1-xLixTiO3 and LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 [ 44  45 ]  Recently  ABO3 perovskite systems were mainly focused on their electrochemical properties for the anode of Ni/MH batteries establishing what is normally called Ni–oxide batteries [ 46  47 ]  Previous studies have revealed exciting results of their electrochemical capacity and cycle life especially in extreme environmental conditions [ 46 ]  Perovskite materials are known for their catalytic behavior in hydrogen-rich media  which have been the motivation to study these materials for electrochemical hydrogen storage  Overall  the usage of perovskite oxides in Ni–oxide batteries is based on the advantages presented for these materials in the catalysis and ionic conduction applications  For instance  perovskite oxides can be designed with a range of compositions and elements in A- and B-sites  which allow to tailor the electrochemical properties  In this sense  the stoichiometry and valance can be modified  so enhancing their hydrogen absorption properties  Other properties of interests for Ni-battery application are the high corrosion resistance of perovskite oxides and their thermal stability  One of the first studies using perovskite oxides in the field of Ni–oxide batteries was carried out by Esaka et al  [ 48 ]  who reported the ( SrCe095Yb005O3 ) composition as negative electrode material for Ni–oxide batteries  Interestingly  this composition presented aqueous hydrogen absorption and desorption at room temperature  In fact  perovskite oxides have been widely studied as negative electrodes materials for aqueous Ni–oxide batteries  For instance  Deng et al  [ 13 ] also studied ABO3 perovskite systems as negative electrodes reporting that compositions such as La1−xSrxFeO3 ( for X = 02 and 04 ) present electrochemical activity  which is improved with temperature and is affected by the crystalline array  One of the key findings is that a rhombohedral structure in the La1−xSrxFeO3 system ( X = 04 ) can accept more hydrogen within its structure in comparison to the orthorhombic one ( X = 02 )  For example  the discharge capacity value of the rhombohedral structure was 77 mAh/g at room temperature ; meanwhile  the orthorhombic structure presented a discharge capacity value of 54 mAh/g at room temperature  The environmental temperature is another crucial factor in the performance of perovskite materials in Ni–oxide batteries  Different authors have reported an increase of the electrochemical capacity of perovskites two to four times the value reported at room temperature  For example  Henao et al  [ 46 ] reported capacity values of the La04Sr06CO08Fe02O3 compound that increased from 514 mAh/g at room temperature to 462 mAh/g at 333 K Other authors have reported similar results [ 26  29 ]  In perovskite oxides employed as negative electrode materials in Ni–oxide batteries  hydrogen insertion is associated with the electrochemical capacity of the system  Hydrogen absorption is given by the reduction of water at the interface electrolyte/electrode  where hydrogen protons are inserted within the perovskite structure  The following reactions describe the behavior of an electrochemical Ni–perovskite ( ABO3-type ) oxide half-cell [ 46 ] : begin { aligned } { text { ABO } } _ { 3 } + { text { xH } } _ { 2 } { text { O } } + { text { xe } } ^ { - } leftrightarrow

} } : { text { discharge } } } right ) hfill  end { aligned } ( 4 ) In this manner  the total electrochemical reaction of a Ni/perovskite ( ABO3-type ) oxide battery is given by begin { aligned } { text { xNi } } left ( { text { OH } } right ) { text { x } } + { text { ABO } } _ { 3 } leftrightarrow { text { xNiOOH } } + { text { AB } } _ { 1- x } { text { B } } _ { x } { text { O } } _ { 3 } { text { H } } _ { x } hfill  left ( { { text { Forward } } : { text { charge } } ; { text { Reverse } } : { text { discharge } } } right ) hfill  end { aligned } ( 5 ) According to the mechanisms proposed in the literature available  hydrogen protons are bonded with the lattice oxygen in perovskites  The chemical bond between oxygen and hydrogen is less strong when the bond between transition metals on the perovskite structure and oxygen is stronger  This phenomenon has been elucidated in various studies that have shown the effect of A-site and B-site substitution in ABO3 compounds  In fact  it has been noted that doping affects strongly the electronic structure and chemical bonds  resulting in the enhancement of electrochemical properties [ 46  49 ]  The improvement of the electrochemical properties of perovskite oxides in aqueous electrolytes in Ni–oxide batteries is another key property that motivates its application in these systems  The substantial improvement of the electrochemical capacity in perovskite oxides with temperature is often attributed to the improved atomic motion at the electrode/electrolyte interface and to their excellent corrosion resistance  It worth mentioning that mechanisms of improved electrochemical capacities of perovskite oxides have not been exposed at all ; however  since hydrogen absorption is related to the bond H–O in the lattice  one can assume that when increased the environmental temperature more hydrogen protons are inserted in some extent into the perovskite structure  In fact  some authors have reported that free hydrogen atoms are usually present on perovskites because H–O bonds are broken with temperature [ 49 ]  At the same time  the increase of temperature favors their diffusion  Several experimental studies have demonstrated that hydrogen diffusion increases with the increment of temperature in perovskites [ 29  46 ]  Table 1 summarizes the electrochemical properties of ABO3 perovskite-type oxide used as negative electrode materials in Ni–oxide batteries so far  Table 1 Compilation of properties for different ABO3 perovskite-type oxide electrodes for Ni–oxide batteries reported in the literature Full size table Despite the numerous studies regarding the electrochemical properties of perovskites oxides  there is no evidence in the literature available on studying layered perovskite materials as negative electrode materials for Ni–oxide batteries  As mentioned above in this section  the basic lattice array is one of the key factors influencing the electrochemical properties of perovskites  For instance  in the La1-xSrxFeO3 perovskite compound  the electrochemical behavior changes remarkably when its basic lattice array is transformed from orthorhombic to rhombohedral because of the addition of the doping element from x = 02 to x = 04  06  respectively [ 50 ]  Therefore  it may be very interesting to compare the mechanisms acting on layered perovskites with respect to traditional ABO3 compounds  Due to the lack of literature available related to the usage of layered perovskites  in the present book chapter  it is presented one of the first studies carried out on layered perovskites as negative electrode material for Ni–oxide batteries  Electrode preparation and electrochemical studies performed on a layered perovskite oxide will be introduced in the next section  3 Layered Perovskites as New Electrode Materials in Ni–Oxide Batteries Layered perovskite oxides differ from conventional ABO3 oxides in the sense that layered ones have a more complex structure including separation of basic perovskite array forming a type of channels  This subtle variation in the geometrical configuration of layered perovskites in comparison to conventional ones can be possibly reflected on the electrochemical performance of layered perovskites  Considering that hydrogen absorption in perovskites is associated with oxygen-related positions  one can expect that layered perovskites can also be able to support the insertion of hydrogen protons in their structure  In this section  a first approach on the study of layered perovskites as electrode material in Ni–oxide batteries is introduced  To achieve this goal  the Nd2Ti2O5-layered perovskite compound previously prepared as nanometric powder by means of the sol–gel method according to the procedure presented in Sect  2 has been used to prepare negative electrodes for a Ni–oxide cell  31 Nd2Ti2O5 Electrode Preparation and Electrochemical Setup The Nd2Ti2O7 electrodes were fabricated using the “ latex ” method  The Nd2Ti2O7 nanometric powder was mixed with black carbon and polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE )  This mixture was prepared to provide the compound with good electrical conductivity and good handling during the electrochemical tests  The weight ratio of the Nd2Ti2O7  carbon black  and PTFE was 90:5:5  respectively  Before depositing the powder mixture on the Ni-mesh  ethylene glycol was added to form a viscoelastic paste  A 1 cm2 Ni-mesh was used as current collector  and consequently  it acted as support to deposit the active material  The deposited viscoelastic paste was dried for 2 h to evaporate the solvent  Then  a cold pressing machine was employed to cold-press the deposited active material onto the Ni-mesh at a pressure of 40 MPa  The electrochemical performance of the prepared neodymium titanate electrodes was tested in a conventional three-electrode open-air cell ( Potentiostat–Galvanostat  Gamry 1000E ) using the layered perovskite compound as the working electrode  Hg/HgO as the reference electrode  Ni ( OH ) 2 as the counter electrode  and KOH ( 6 M ) solution as the electrolyte  32 Nd2Ti2O5 Electrochemical Performance Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed to reveal the electrochemical reactions of the Nd2Ti2O7 electrode in 6 M KOH aqueous solution  Figure 6 shows the cyclic voltammogram of the Nd2Ti2O7 negative electrode  Fig  6 figure 6 Cyclic voltammogram of the Nd2Ti2O7 electrode Full size image Cyclic voltammetry is normally used to study qualitative information about electrochemical processes  including the occurrence of oxidation and reduction reactions and the reversibility of a reaction [ 51 ]  In the present study  an oxidation peak appears at −09 V with respect to the Hg/HgO reference electrode  and a reduction peak appears at −0625 V with respect to the Hg/HgO reference electrode  This pair of redox peaks suggests that a reversible electrochemical reaction is occurring on the Nd2Ti2O7 working electrode  Interestingly  these peaks exhibit similar potential values compared with conventional electrodes used in Ni–MH batteries [ 52 ]  The desorption peak of hydrogen appears prior to the electrochemical oxidation peak of hydrogen  suggesting the possible existence of hydrogen chemisorption  Moreover  the reduction peak becomes more visible with increasing number of cycles  indicating that the Nd2Ti2O7 electrode must be possibly activated  The inset in Fig  6 corresponds to the cyclic voltammogram of the Ni-mesh used as current collector  Interestingly  the results demonstrate that there are no peaks indicating oxidation and reduction reactions involving the current collector material  In addition  if compared with the curve of the layered perovskite  it is clearly observable that the area under the curve of the layered perovskite is larger than that of the Ni-mesh  which directly related to the electrochemical capacity of the material  To quantify the capacity values of the layered perovskite electrode  the charge/discharge properties of the Nd2Ti2O7 negative electrode were investigated using the chronopotentiometry technique  The working electrodes were fully charged and discharged at constant current densities of 10  30  60  and 125 mA/g  Table 2 summarizes the maximum discharge capacity values obtained in the experiments : Table 2 Maximum discharge capacity values of the Nd2Ti2O7 layered perovskite compound Full size table Results in Table 2 reveal that the electrochemical capacity of the layered Nd2Ti2O7 perovskite compound is comparable with the electrochemical capacity values obtained for conventional ABO3 perovskite oxides  For instance  recent studies focused on the usage of La06Sr02Co02FeO3 as negative electrode material for Ni–oxide batteries has reported electrochemical capacity values of about 514 mAh/g at 298 K and discharge current density of 125 mAh/g [ 46 ]  The fact that the electrochemical capacity of the electrodes increases when the applied current decreases is associated with the kinetics of the process  This phenomenon has been widely observed in Ni–MH and Ni–oxide cells  One can also observe in Fig  7 that the maximum electrochemical capacity of the electrodes depends on the number of electrochemical cycles  In all applied current densities  the capacity of the electrodes increases up to a maximum and then it stabilizes  This observation suggests that this layered perovskite composition must be activated electrochemically as normally occurs in conventional intermetallic electrodes used in Ni–MH batteries [ 53 ]  Activation is often associated with the expansion of the structure and cracking of the surface  which becomes exposed to the electrolyte  Figure 8 shows the SEM images of the electrodes before and after activation  The SEM image of the as-prepared electrodes shows a compacted powder typical of cold-pressed electrodes  Once the electrodes are activated  one can note that small particles appear on the surface of these electrodes indicating some perturbation on the initial structure of the electrode  Previous studies have obtained similar results after studying ABO3 perovskite compounds due to the penetration of the electrolyte into the perovskite structure [ 54 ]  Fig  7 figure 7 Performance of the Nd2Ti2O7 perovskite layered electrode at a 10 mA/g  b 30 mA/g  c 60 mA/g  d 125 mA/g applied current densities Full size image Fig  8 figure 8 SEM micrograph of the Nd2Ti2O7 perovskite layered electrode a as-prepared electrode ; b after 20 activation cycles Full size image The hydrogen diffusion coefficient of the Nd2Ti2O7 oxide was also calculated in the present study by the potential-step discharge technique  This method consists of applying a potential step while monitoring the anodic current–time response  The semi-logarithmic curve obtained from this experiment is often divided into two-time regions [ 55 ]  In the first one  the current undergoes a rapid decrease because of the rapid consumption of hydrogen on the surface of the electrode  The first region is governed by the charge transfer kinetics and/or by charge transfer and diffusion ( mixed kinetics )  Nevertheless  in the second-time region  the current gradually decreases in a linear way with time and is controlled by the hydrogen diffusion  Figure 9 shows the semi-logarithmic curve of the anodic current–time response for the Nd2Ti2O7 electrode at 50 and 100 % state of charge ( SOC )  The results reveal that the current time response of the Nd2Ti2O7 electrode presents both regions ( mixed- and diffusion-controlled )  which are descaled to each other due to the effect of SOC  The hydrogen diffusion coefficient DH is often calculated from the diffusion-controlled region in the electrode bulk according to the following equation [ 46  55 ] : Fig  9 figure 9 Semi-logarithm curve of the Nd2Ti2O7 electrode Full size image log  i = log left [ { frac { { 6FD_ { H } } } { { da^ { 2 } } } left ( { C_ { 0 } - C_ { s } } right ) } right ] - frac { { pi^ { 2 } } } { 2303 } frac { { D_ { H } t } } { { a^ { 2 } } } ( 6 ) In Eq  ( 6 )  i is the anodic current density ( A/g )  DH is the hydrogen diffusion coefficient ( cm2/s )  d is the density of the compound ( g/cm3 )  a is the average radius of the particles  Co is the initial hydrogen concentration in the bulk of the electrode ( mol/cm3 )  Cs is the surface hydrogen concentration of the electrode ( mol/cm3 )  and t is the discharge time ( s )  According to Eq  ( 2 )  DH was estimated as 569 × 10−13 and 484 × 10−13 and for the Nd2Ti2O7 electrode at 50 and 100 % SOC  that is  DH decreases with the state of charge  These results can be related to the fact that diffusion paths are linked to oxygen-related positions within the perovskite oxide structure  Once the electrode initiates the charge process  many of these oxygen positions become occupied forming an O–H chemical bond  However  when the number of H+ ions inserted into the unit cell of perovskite oxides increases  the O–H bond reduces its strength and consequently the activation energy necessary to break the O–H bond  This fact makes easier the hydrogen ion transportation [ 49 ]  Interestingly  the Nd2Ti2O7-layered electrode presents similar DH values than conventional perovskite ABO3 oxide electrodes [ 46 ]  The results obtained in the present chapter have shown that layered perovskite materials can be useful as electrode materials for Ni–oxide batteries since they can show reversibility and can store hydrogen electrochemically  Further studies involving techniques such as impedance and molecular dynamic simulations are encouraged for comparing the mechanisms acting on conventional perovskites and layered perovskites  4 Perspectives and Suggestions Regarding the Selection of Perovskite Materials for Ni–Oxide and Metal–Air Batteries It has already been noted that Ni–oxide battery performance is often better when the perovskite electrode is a doped material  The ABO3 compound is predominantly orthorhombic or rhombohedral structures that generally are affected in the type of dopants used  There are several requirements for the electrochemical properties of Ni–oxide battery electrode  and all these properties must be balanced for practical use  It has been found that rare earth perovskite-type compounds have high electrochemical capacities with respect to conventional perovskite oxides since rare earth elements present high affinity for hydrogen absorption among the elements of the periodic table  Therefore  multiple elements including rare elements are needed in ABO3 perovskite compounds to achieve good electrochemical capacities  In case layered perovskite materials such as A2B2O7-type compounds are only the beginning of the way to understand their behavior  thus  new experiment involving different compositions should be performed  Alternatively  for metal–air battery applications  a common target is to develop electrode materials with enhanced catalytic performance ( electrical and chemical )  In this sense  it is recommended the selection of small particles with a large surface area  The development of a rechargeable metal–air battery technology is expected to become one of the most widely used technologies in the future because of the high energy density that these systems can develop  In this sense  one of the critical points to solve before commercializing the metal–air technology is the slow kinetics of discharging and charging reactions at the air electrode  5 Concluding Remarks Perovskite materials have been associated with different applications in batteries  especially  as catalysis materials and electrode materials in rechargeable Ni–oxide  Li–ion  and metal–air batteries  Numerous perovskite compositions have been studied so far on the technologies previously mentioned ; this is mainly because perovskite materials usually present reversible electrochemical behavior  high natural abundance  facile synthesis  low price  and environmental benignity  Some examples of demonstrated technological usage of perovskites are full cells where perovskite materials are often employed as materials for ionic transportation  Different forms of structural perovskites can be often produced by means of different chemical methods  which provides a great field of opportunity in different types of batteries  One of the examples given in the present book chapter was the layered perovskite material that  as far as authors concern  there is no at this time literature available regarding layered A2B2O7 perovskites as negative electrode materials for Ni–oxide batteries  As already demonstrated in this chapter  layered perovskite materials can be alternative electrode materials for Ni–oxide batteries  Overall  ABO3 perovskite oxides present excellent discharge capacity at high temperatures  and consequently  are regarded as a prominent alternative for negative electrode materials for the next generation of high-temperature and high-performance Ni/oxide batteries  Further research work is expected to optimize the properties and performance of A2B2O7 layered compounds and on this way be able to discriminate the type of perovskite-type structure offering the best electrochemical performanceAbstract A comprehensive numerical analysis for a Lead- free perovskite solar cell has been carried out using device simulation software  Enumerated study of two types of configurations La07Sr03MnO3/ZnO ( LSMO/ZnO ) and La07Sr03MnO3/Nb–SrTiO3 ( LSMO/NSTO ) are simulated which gives power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 678 and 047 % after optimizing different parameters using SCAPS-1D numerical simulation  Bandgap analysis of LSMO/NSTO shows 35 and 65 % discontinuity in the conduction band and valence band  which directly affect in the collection of charge carriers  While LSMO/ZnO configuration has continuity in the energy bands so large number of carriers collected as compared to NSTO buffer layer and it also leads to higher PCE  Buffer layer thickness optimization is also carried out  Access provided by Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology Download conference paper PDF 1 Introduction and Cell Structure Perovskites are the most emerging materials in solar cell nowadays most commonly organometal halide Ch3Nh3PbBr3 [ 1  2 ] but these are limited due to toxicity [ 3 ] and less stability at room temperature [ 4 ]  In this paper  we propose a nontoxic material La07Sr03MnO3 ( LSMO ) [ 5  6 ] an absorber layer and ZnO [ 7 ] or Nb-doped NSTO [ 8 ] as a buffer layer  As the majority of charge carriers in LSMO are holes [ 9 ] so it is selected as an absorber layer and for the buffer layer of heterostructure a material has to be chosen such that it can form a junction with the absorber layer providing minimum losses  To satisfy these condition  n-type material which has a comparable lattice constant as LSMO  selected so that stain caused by lattice mismatch can be ignored  To remove the absorption losses wider band gap materials Nb-doped Strontium Tin oxide ( NSTO ) and Zinc oxide ( ZnO ) have been selected as a buffer layer  Two types of solar cells are designed and its performance is analyzed with energy band diagram  A planer structure of Pb-free perovskite solar cell ( PSC ) with LSMO/NSTO and LSMO/ZnO configuration is shown in Fig  691a  b respectively  Fig  691 figure 1 Device architecture using LSMO as an absorber layer and a NSTO  b ZnO as a buffer layer Full size image 2 Numerical Simulations Numerical simulations help to understand certain device properties and processes  to realize the optimized cell structure  The device is analyzed with the SCAPS-1D ( solar cell capacitance simulator ) version 3303 simulation software [ 10 ]  Two cell structures have been simulated  Optimum simulation parameters used in different layers [ 111213 ]  For each structure optimized testing conditions such as temperature 300 K  light source 15 AM at the power of 100 mW/m2  3 µm absorber layer thickness and same back and contact layer have been used  3 Results and Discussions 31 Band Diagram Analysis A typical LSMO ( 3 µm ) cell consists of ZnO ( 05 µm ) and NSTO ( 05 µm ) buffer layers  The schematic energy-band diagram under equilibrium condition for LSMO/NSTO and LSMO/ZnO solar cells with a uniform band-gap profiles are illustrated in Fig  692  Under equilibrium condition  both p and n semiconductors have to save Fermi level  which shows that Fermi level is independent of the position [ 14 ] ie  Fig  692 figure 2 Energy-band diagram of a typical a LSMO/NSTO and b LSMO/ZnO solar cell under an equilibrium condition Full size image Under illumination of light  due to excess holes ( ∇p ) and electrons ( ∇n ) generation  change in carrier concentration separate the Fermi levels of p and n semiconductors  In LSMO/NSTO configuration we have an inbuilt potential variation which is not continuous  we have 35 and 65 % difference in their Ec and Ev respectively so band gap discontinuity of 078 eV and 146 eV occurs respectively in conduction band ∇Ec and valence band ∇Ev  and it blocks the flow of carriers  While transition  electron behaves such as air bubbles and holes such as water flow [ 15 ]  Electron in p- LSMO found a barrier of 078 eV so they can ’ t jump from LSMO to NSTO but there will be some holes which will move up and flow a minute current  it may also flow due to tunnelling of carriers [ 16 ]  Here LSMO/ZnO configuration also shows a constant Fermi level under equilibrium  under illumination the Fermi level separates and move upward from the equilibrium condition  ZnO behaves as highly doped semiconductor so large number of the electron will be available for transition and LSMO behaves as lightly doped semiconductor so it may have both types of carrier concentration  In this analogy  a large number of electrons can flow from active region to ZnO but respectively a few holes to the LSMO [ 17 ]  32 Power Conversion Efficiency Analysis of Solar Cells In this section  J-V characteristics of two multilayer structures LSMO ( 3 µm ) /NSTO ( 05 µm ) and LSMO ( 3 µm ) /ZnO ( 05 µm ) have been simulated as depicted in Fig  693  Both configurations have rectifying characteristics in dark  As light illuminated on the buffer layer it shows a change in current density due to excess charge carriers generated by photons so it can be inferred that LSMO/NSTO and LSMO/ZnO heterostructure work as a solar cell  Fig  693 figure 3 J/V characteristic for a LSMO/NSTO and b LSMO/ZnO heterostructure for AM 15 illumination ( inset in dark ) Full size image LSMO/NSTO has only 047 % PCE  may because of the large discontinuity at the interface hence a few charge carriers cross/tunnel through the barrier ; where LSMO/ZnO heterostructure has 678 % PCE due to continuity at valence band [ 18 ] and the conduction band  It also shows that short-circuit current in LSMO/ZnO is approximately 10 % higher then LSMO/NSTO  This indicates enhanced separation and collection of photogenerated charge carriers in LSMO/ZnO  Whereas in LSMO/NSTO thin depletion region is formed but comparatively it has a poor collection of charge carriers because it may have a lot of Oxygen vacancy at the interface [ 19 ]  33 Impact of Buffer Layer Thickness on Voc and Jsc From Fig  694 it can be also analyzed that both configurations follow a decreasing trend in Voc and Jsc due to photon losses [ 20 ] with enhancement in the buffer layer thickness  As the buffer layer thickness increases  most of the incident photons will be absorbed by buffer layer and thus a few photons manage to reach the absorber layer as compared to thicker layer that contributes to the quantum efficiency of the device such that device performance decreases [ 21 ]  Fig  694 figure 4 a Open circuit voltage and b short circuit current density dependence on buffer layer thickness Full size image From the result  it can be concluded that minimal thickness of NSTO and ZnO have higher performance but the too thin film may contribute to leakage current  From the above  optimized buffer layer thickness is taken as 05 µm  4 Conclusion This paper presents the device modeling and energy band profile analysis for lead-free perovskite solar cell  We have analyzed that in LSMO/NSTO configuration carriers can ’ t collect at the respective sides due to large band gap discontinuity  Because of a few carrier collections  PCE is only 047 % and on the other hand  LSMO/ZnO has 678 % PCE due to smooth band edges profile  This study has revealed the dependence of solar cell characteristics on the buffer layer  the discontinuity at the interface which affects the performance of perovskite solar cell  Buffer layer thickness study shows that the optimum buffer layer thickness is 05 µm for 14 eV band gap of the absorber layer at room temperature for a defect-free layerptical wireless communication ( OWC ) using the ultra-broad spectrum of the visible-to-ultraviolet ( UV ) wavelength region remains a vital field of research for mitigating the saturated bandwidth of radio-frequency ( RF ) communication  However  the lack of an efficient UV photodetection methodology hinders the development of UV-based communication  The key technological impediment is related to the low UV-photon absorption in existing silicon photodetectors  which offer low-cost and mature platforms  To address this technology gap  we report a hybrid Si-based photodetection scheme by incorporating CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals ( NCs ) with a high photoluminescence quantum yield ( PLQY ) and a fast photoluminescence ( PL ) decay time as a UV-to-visible colour-converting layer for high-speed solar-blind UV communication  The facile formation of drop-cast CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs leads to a high PLQY of up to ~73 % and strong absorption in the UV region  With the addition of the NC layer  a nearly threefold improvement in the responsivity and an increase of ~25 % in the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of the solar-blind region compared to a commercial silicon-based photodetector were observed  Moreover  time-resolved photoluminescence measurements demonstrated a decay time of 45 ns under a 372-nm UV excitation source  thus elucidating the potential of this layer as a fast colour-converting layer  A high data rate of up to 34 Mbps in solar-blind communication was achieved using the hybrid CsPbBr3–silicon photodetection scheme in conjunction with a 278-nm UVC light-emitting diode ( LED )  These findings demonstrate the feasibility of an integrated high-speed photoreceiver design of a composition-tuneable perovskite-based phosphor and a low-cost silicon-based photodetector for UV communication  Similar content being

Diodes Article Open access 07 December 2023 Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells–compositions for improved stability and power conversion efficiency Article 22 November 2023 Introduction Paving the way for fifth-generation ( 5G ) wireless communication and beyond  which requires higher bandwidth and lower latency  optical wireless communication ( OWC )  including visible light communication ( VLC ) and ultraviolet ( UV ) -based communication  has attracted considerable attention  Compared to the existing regulated radio-frequency ( RF ) communication  OWC offers an unlicensed and secured bandwidth spanning UV to visible wavelengths of up to hundreds of THz to mitigate the congested bandwidth in the RF network1  For VLC  high data rates on the order of gigabits per second ( Gbps ) have been widely demonstrated using different modulation schemes in the line-of-sight ( LOS ) configuration234  However  this configuration by itself is inadequate for a complete communication system  Mimicking the indirect RF signal transmission pathway is pivotal in offering a robust solution for OWC  Fortunately  light in the UV wavelength region is highly scattered through both Rayleigh and Mie scattering  thus constituting the much-required non-line-of-sight ( NLOS ) communication pathway  This pathway will relieve the strict requirements on pointing  acquisition  and tracking in LOS communication56  Furthermore  UV-based communication is highly appealing compared to VLC owing to its low background solar radiation  particularly in the solar-blind UVC region ( 100–280 nm ) due to the strong absorption by the ozone layer  Low noise-floor free-space communication in the UVC spectrum will also enable a wide variety of applications  such as missile detection7 and aircraft landing in low visibility conditions8  Moving forward  a reliable UV-based communication link  specifically in the UVC region  will create new frontiers for OWC systems  empowering the internet of things ( IoT ) and internet of underwater things ( IoUT )  Despite the importance of a UV-based communication link  the limitations of transmitter and receiver technologies impede the current advancement  For the receiver end  high-performance photodiodes or multi-pixel detectors across the UV-to-visible region are crucial for various practical applications  In the OWC field  the bulky photomultiplier tube ( PMT ) is still being used owing to its large spectral range and high signal-to-noise ( SNR ) ratio9  However  it suffers from a high power consumption  a bulky form factor  and a high cost10  In contrast  compact and small-footprint group-III-nitride-based PDs11  eg  AlGaN-12  AlN-13  and BN14-based PDs  suffer from costly materials and substrate development  The existence of defect states and crystal dislocations related to high dark current complicates the design process and delays the further deployment of these PDs in UV-based communication systems  On the other hand  low-cost and technologically mature silicon ( Si ) -based PDs are widely and commercially available  Nevertheless  owing to the low penetration depth of high-energy UV photons in the silicon layer ( eg  < 20 nm for the deep UV-to-UVA region ) 15  the responsivity of commercial Si-based PDs is less than 01 A/W for wavelengths below 400 nm  For practical communication in the UVC-to-UVA band  this low responsivity will degrade the SNR of the communication link  In the following  recent efforts to circumvent the abovementioned issue are described for completeness  although it is noted that these techniques are not suitable for high-speed OWC systems  A conjugated polymer thin film was first used as a luminescent material for enhancing the UV responsivity of Si-based PDs by Levell et al16  This method explores the use of luminescent thin films to absorb high-energy UV photons that are re-emitted in the visible-wavelength region  in which Si-based PDs exhibit a higher responsivity  Another down-converting luminescent material based on yttrium–vanadate–phosphate–borate : Eu ( Y ( V  PO4 ) 09 ( BO3 ) 01 : Eu ) integrated with Si-based PDs was also demonstrated in a previous study17 ; however  both luminescent materials are known to have a long decay time of up to the order of milliseconds1819 and are thus not suitable for high-speed modulation  A nanopatterned luminescent solar concentrator for VLC was also investigated by Dong et al20 ; however  the SuperYellow fluorescent emitter exhibits reduced absorption in the UV region  which limits its operation to only the visible-wavelength region  Zhang et al  also demonstrated the integration of MAPbBr3-based perovskite quantum dots with an electron multiplying charge coupled device-based image sensor21  Thus far  to the best of our knowledge  down-converting luminescent material for UV-based receivers  particularly those suitable for high-speed solar-blind UVC communication links  have not been investigated and demonstrated  In contrast to other down-converting luminescent materials  all-inorganic lead halide perovskites ( CsPbX3  where X = Cl  Br and I ) have emerged as a new class of materials for optoelectronic applications owing to their facile solution-processable synthesis  controllable visible emission spectrum  high photoluminescence ( PL ) quantum yield ( PLQY ) and low optical gain threshold2223  Moreover  recent approaches using a novel passivation technique24 and a Fabry-Perot microcavity25 on lead halide perovskite have also been shown to induce ultrastable amplified spontaneous emission and even lasing characteristics22  Such advancements are essential for realising high-performance optical devices  such as up-conversion lasers and high-resolution optical microscopes  CsPbBr3 nanocrystals ( NCs ) are among the most studied all-inorganic perovskites owing to their recently achieved highly air-stable characteristics compared with other organic halide perovskites  eg  chloride- and iodide-based perovskite NCs26  In addition  CsPbBr3 NCs have a high absorption coefficient as well as a suitable bandgap for light detection and were recently demonstrated for use in a low-dose X-ray scintilator27  The abovementioned studies  however  do not shed light on the possibility of high-speed photodetection in the UVB–UVC band  Herein  we present a novel receiver design for a UVC communication link using a hybrid CsPbBr3-silicon colour-converting photodetection scheme  The responsivity and external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of Si-based PDs in the green spectrum region are significantly higher than those in the UV region  The high-PLQY drop-cast CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer on a UV quartz substrate can effectively down-convert the incident UV light into the green wavelength region to realise an enhanced photodetection performance in the UV region  The measured small-signal modulation bandwidth of the hybrid PD confirmed the feasibility of high-frequency modulation  Correspondingly  a high-speed solar-blind UVC communication link was demonstrated using a 278-nm solar-blind UVC LED as a transmitter and the hybrid CsPbBr3–silicon colour converter as a receiver  Notably  the present study demonstrates the feasibility of using a high-PLQY and high-speed CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer as a revolutionary colour-converting luminescent material in a mature silicon-foundry-based PD platform for high-sensitivity and high-speed UV-based communication  This game-changing and disruptive device technology is expected to eventually eliminate the need for the pursuit of a large bandgap semiconductor platform for high-speed UV photodetection  Results Figure 1a  b shows transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and high-resolution TEM ( HR-TEM ) images of the CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs used in the present study  The corresponding HR-TEM image shown in Fig  1b reveals cubic NCs with an average size of approximately 639 ± 06 nm ( see Supplementary Fig  S1 for a detailed image )  Figure 1c shows the absorption and PL spectra of CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs  It is apparent that the CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layers have a sharp PL emission at approximately 506 nm  with a narrow full width at half maximum of 19 nm  At the same time  strong absorption in the UV region is also observed  which can be further validated by the PL excitation scan shown in Supplementary Fig  S2  In addition  the radiative recombination time between the photoexcited electron and hole of the CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer was measured from the PL decay trace  which was monitored at 506 nm following 372 nm excitation ( see Fig  1d )  The PL lifetime decay profile was collected at 506 nm  The decay curve can be fitted with a single exponential function with a lifetime of approximately 45 ± 01 ns  thus elucidating the potential of this layer as a high-speed luminescent material  In addition  we measured the PLQY of CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs dispersed in toluene and drop-cast onto a quartz substrate and found it to be near unity in the solution form  while it was reduced to ~73 % in the thin-film form ( see Supplementary Fig  S3 )  The high PLQY demonstrated in the case of the CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer is significantly higher than that of the other down-converting materials for the Si-based receiver  for instance  aluminium tris- ( 8-hydroxyquinoline ) ( Alq3 ) 28  N  N ’ -diphenyl-N  N ’ -bis- ( 3-methylphenyl ) -11′-biphenyl-44′-diamine28  bis- ( 8-hydroxyquinaldine ) -chlorogallium ( Ga Cl ) 28  fluorene copolymers16 and SuperYellow20  Compared to other organic-based luminescent materials  the improvement in terms of the PLQY is largely ascribed to the increased rate of recombination due to the reduced dimensionality ( from a 3D bulk layer to 0D NCs )  as well as to the unique synthesis method that results in reduced surface defects of NCs and surface passivation by oleic acid and oleylamine ligands  Using this method  the perovskite NCs are less susceptible to variations in the environment and thus yield a higher PLQY even in the form of thin films under ambient environments  Moreover  compared with commercialised CdSe-based NCs with a PLQY of ~30–52 % and a PL decay time of a few tens of ns29  it is apparent that the PLQY achieved in CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs is significantly higher  concurrent with a faster PL decay time ( < 5 ns )  Fig  1 : Structural and optical characterisation of CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs  figure 1 a Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) image and b high-resolution TEM

perovskite NCs on a UV quartz substrate Full size image By taking advantage of the high-PLQY and short-PL lifetime  in the following sections  we explore the potential of CsPbBr3 NCs as a discrete component of a colour-converting luminescent material for high-speed Si-based PDs  Micrographs of the CsPbBr3 NC solution and drop-cast film on UV quartz when excited with a 278-nm UVC light source are shown in Fig  2a  The transmittance of the UV quartz used in the present study can be found in Supplementary Fig  S4 ; > 90 % transmission can be observed from the UV-to visible-wavelength regions  For effective collection of the light re-emitted from the CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer  the experimental setup shown in Fig  2b was used to measure the photoelectrical performance of the Si-based PD with and without the addition of the luminescent material  The drop-cast CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs on the UV quartz were inserted into the integrating sphere  The inner surface of the integrating sphere was coated with polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE )  which is known to have > 95 % reflectivity from the deep-UV to infra-red wavelength regions  For proof of concept  a commercially available Si-based PIN junction PD ( Thorlabs Inc  FDS100 ) with an active area of 13 mm2 was used for comparison  The uncoated borosilicate window was removed to expose the bare Si-based PIN structure  Figure 2c shows the measured responsivity of the commercial Si-based PD ; it is evident that the responsivity drops significantly ( < 01 A/W ) towards the UV region ( < 380 nm )  This observation can be largely attributed to the low penetration depth  eg  a few tens of nanometres  of UV light in the Si-based layer  as reported by Shi et al15  To circumvent this issue  we aimed to down-shift the UV light absorbed by the high-PLQY CsPbBr3 NC layer into the green wavelength region  where Si-based PDs exhibit a higher responsivity of up to 02 A/W  as shown in Fig  2c  Fig  2 : Novel photodetection scheme based on the hybrid CsPbBr3-Si platform  figure 2 a Drop-cast CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer on UV quartz under UV illumination  b Schematic illustration of the photoelectrical measurement setup of the Si-based PD with a CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer on UV quartz inside the integrating sphere  c Measured responsivity spectrum of the bare Si-based PD Full size image Figure 3a shows the measured I–V characteristics of the Si-based PD under dark conditions ( black line ) as well as under 270-nm ( red line ) and 510-nm ( purple line ) excitation sources from 0 to 20 V ( reverse bias )  The incoming light intensity for both measurement wavelengths at 270 and 510 nm was calibrated to 85 µW/cm2 using neutral density ( ND ) filters  The photocurrent generated under excitation by the 270-nm light source is approximately an order of magnitude lower than that under excitation by the 510-nm light source  Notably  with the addition of the CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer on the highly UV-transparent quartz substrate in the integrating sphere  the down-conversion approach allows higher absorption by the Si-based PD even under excitation by the 270-nm light source  thus generating a higher photocurrent ( see the cyan line in Fig  3a )  distinctly closer to that under excitation by the 510-nm source  However  when the CsPbBr3 layer is under illumination  a fraction of absorbed photons is re-emitted at a longer wavelength depending on the quantum yield of the enhancement layer  while the remaining fraction of unabsorbed or scattered photons can escape into the Si-based PD without any photon conversion process16  These photons will result in additional carriers photogenerated from the two distinct wavelengths ( eg  510 and 270 nm ) in the Si-based PD  To evaluate the actual photogenerated carriers of the proposed colour-converting scheme based on the CsPbBr3 NC layer  we also measured the resultant I–V characteristics with a 500-nm long-pass ( LP ) filter ( Thorlabs  FELH0500 ) mounted between the integrating sphere and the Si-based PD  By using the LP filter to prevent the unabsorbed UV-wavelength photons from being detected by the Si-based PD  as shown in Fig  3a ( see the green line )  the photogenerated carriers remain higher than those under the 270-nm illumination without the CsPbBr3 NC layer  Using the integrating sphere  we also measured the responsivity of the Si-based PD with and without the addition of the CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer in the UV wavelength region  The responsivity ( R ) is a key figure of merit for PDs  and it can be calculated on the basis of the generated photocurrent ( Iphotocurrent ) and incident light power ( Pincident ) as follows : ( 1 ) Fig  3 : Performance of the hybrid CsPbBr3–Si photodetection scheme  figure 3 a I–V curves of the Si-based PD with reverse bias from 0 to 20 V The dark current is represented by the black line  while the red line represents the I–V curves with a 270-nm incident wavelength ( λin )  and the purple line represents the I–V curves with a 510-nm incident wavelength  The enhanced photocurrent due to the down-conversion process of CsPbBr3 NCs measured with and without a 500-nm long-pass ( LP ) filter when excited by a 270-nm incident wavelength is represented by the green and cyan lines  respectively  b Comparison of the responsivity spectrum and c external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) for the bare Si-based PD and Si-based PD with the CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer  The inset of b shows a schematic illustration of the photon conversion behaviour with an LP filter mounted between the CsPbBr3 layer in the integrating sphere and the Si-based PD ( Pin : incident light power  λVIS : visible-wavelength photons  λUV : UV-wavelength photons )  d Specific detectivity ( D * ) and noise equivalent power ( NEP ) of the hybrid CsPbBr3–Si photodetection scheme in the UV wavelength region Full size image Figure 3b shows the responsivity spectrum of the bare Si PD and the PD with the insertion of the drop-cast CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs in the integrating sphere over the entire UVC-to-UVA region ( 250–380 nm )  The measurement was taken at 10-nm intervals  and the incident light intensity was calibrated to approximately 85 µW/cm2  As shown in Fig  3b  the overall responsivity value based on the CsPbBr3 NC layer without the LP filter is demonstrated to be well above 01 A/W ; however  this high responsivity value is subject to two combined factors of re-emitted visible photons ( λVIS ) and unabsorbed UV photons ( λUV ) that contribute to additional photogenerated carriers  By using the LP filter  we measured the actual value of the responsivity based on the CsPbBr3 NC colour-converting scheme  ie  λUV to λVIS  It is apparent that the responsivity remains nearly threefold higher ( ie  from 29 to 84 mA/W at 270 nm ) than that of the bare Si-based PD  particularly in the UVC wavelength region  where the Si-based PD is known to exhibit low responsivity  This improvement can be attributed to the high PLQY and high UVC absorption of the CsPbBr3 NC layer  The responsivity decreases towards longer wavelengths due to the reduced light absorption at the near band edge of the CsPbBr3 NC layer  which is beyond the intended UV operating wavelength  Nevertheless  our work is comparable to that of Levell et al16  who used an organic-based luminescent material  The organic-based layer exhibits a reduced photoresponse between 250 and 300 nm due to the dip originating from the absorption spectrum  Comparatively  as shown previously in Fig  1c  the absorption spectrum of the CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer increases gradually towards the shorter wavelength region  and thus  the photoresponse remains relatively stable even in the deep UV wavelength region  Moreover  the organic-based layer is also known to have a long PL decay time  which may limit its practical application in high-speed UV-based communication  The enhanced responsivity could significantly improve the sensitivity and SNR ratio of the PDs  particularly in detecting a low-intensity UVC light source  Furthermore  we calculated the photon conversion efficiency  which is also known as the EQE  of the Si-based PD with and without the addition of the CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer in the integrating sphere  The EQE is the ratio of the electron–hole pairs generated by the photodiode to the incident photons ( 2 ) where Rλ is the responsivity in A/W  λincident is the excitation wavelength in nanometres  h is Planck ’ s constant  c is the speed of light in vacuum  and e is the elementary charge  Based on the measured responsivity  the calculated EQE for the bare Si-based PD and PD with the inclusion of the CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer in the integrating sphere is shown in Fig  3c  By using the CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs  without an LP filter  a high EQE of up to 67 % is observed at 270 nm  ascribed to the additional photogenerated carriers in the Si-based PD arising from the unabsorbed UV photons16  Thus  to evaluate the EQE based on the proposed colour-converting scheme  an LP filter must be mounted between the integrating sphere and the Si-based PD  With this setup  the EQE based on the CsPbBr3 colour-converting layer is measured to be approximately 25 % higher than that of the bare Si-based PD in the UVC region  The significantly improved EQE in the UVC wavelength region is attributed to the enhanced photon absorption and increase in the photogenerated carriers after the photon conversion process  It is also worth noting that the carrier multiplication process is not evident because the EQE of the PD in the UV wavelength region remains lower than that in the green wavelength region  ie  ~4641 % at 510 nm  The EQE peak observed at approximately 270 nm corresponds well with the peak position of the absorption spectrum  as shown previously in Fig  1c  where it exhibits higher photon absorption than that beyond 300 nm  This phenomenon results in a higher number of photons being converted to a longer wavelength  where the Si-based PD exhibits a higher responsivity  The absorption coefficient at 270 nm was estimated to be 116 × 103 cm−1  which is comparatively higher than that in the 350 nm band of approximately 089 × 103 cm−1  The estimated absorption coefficient across 250 to 600 nm is included in Supplementary Fig  S5  As demonstrated by Maity et al3031  another important parameter to evaluate the performance of a PD  ie  the specific detectivity ( D * ) was also calculated based on Eq  ( 3 ) as shown below ( 3 ) where A is the device area in cm2  NEP is the noise equivalent power ( NEP ) in W Hz−1/2  e is the elementary charge of 1602 × 10−19 coulombs  Id is the dark current in amperes and Rλ is the responsivity in A/W303132  The D * of the hybrid CsPbBr3–Si photodetection scheme  as shown in Fig  3d  is determined to be 74 × 10−12 cm Hz1/2 W−1 at 270 nm  which is higher than that of the bare Si photodetection scheme  with a value of 25 × 10−12 cm Hz1/2 W−1 at the same measurement wavelength  The comparison of the specific detectivity between bare Si and the hybrid CsPbBr3–Si photodetection scheme is shown in Supplementary Fig  S6  In addition  the noise-related performance of the proposed scheme was also evaluated based on the NEP  NEP is defined as the amount of input optical power that generates an output photocurrent equal to the noise current to yield an SNR of 1  As calculated based on Eq  ( 3 )  in the UVC region  the NEP for the bare Si-based photodiode was calculated to be as high as 149 × 10−13 and 140 × 10−13 W Hz−1/2 for 250 and 270 nm  respectively  By using the proposed colour-converting scheme with CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs  as shown in Fig  3d  the NEP is reduced by more than a half-order of magnitude to 575 × 10−14 and 486 × 10−14 W Hz−1/2 for the same measurement wavelengths at 250 and 270 nm  The comparison of the NEP between bare Si and the hybrid CsPbBr3–Si photodetection scheme is shown in Supplementary Fig  S7  By using the proposed colour-converting scheme  the lower NEP compared to that of the bare Si-based PD contributes to the lower noise floor and enhanced detectivity  particularly in the UVC wavelength region  A comparison of the device performance for various commercial and modified Si-based PDs is also summarised in Supplementary Table S1  In our work  based on the high PLQY of the CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs  the incremental responsivity and EQE were compared to those of a commercial Si-based PD  By using the perovskite phosphor  a similar method could be employed for all the other unmodified and modified Si-based PDs to realise improved performance  thus revolutionising the UV-based photodetection methodology using low-cost Si-based PDs  To further investigate the photostability of the CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer for the UV-based communication link  we performed a 24-h PL stress test in an ambient environment under intense UVC illumination  as shown in Supplementary Fig  S8  The gradual increase in the PL intensity in the first 3 h could be attributed to the evaporation of reduced solvents and the formation of additional emissive centres linked to the dynamics of CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs3334  In the subsequent 12 h  the PL intensity remained stable under ambient conditions  The photostability exceeds that of other untreated CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs  which degrade within a few hours35363738  The reduction of the PL intensity after 16 h of intense continuous irradiation under a focused UVC light source is most likely due to the thermal degradation and photooxidation of lead atoms333940  Further improvement of the photostability of the CsPbBr3 film is undoubtedly possible by employing a core/shell structure38  surface passivating ligands2433 and encapsulation35  as demonstrated in other prior works  For instance  Sun et al  demonstrated highly stable CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs under intense blue-LED light illumination of 175 mW/cm2 based on the sequential surface absorption method37  The coating of strongly hydrophobic silicone resin on perovskite-based NC thin films has also been demonstrated to improve the photostability and water resistance properties  as demonstrated by Hai et al36  These facile and general strategies could open up a new avenue for highly air- and moisture-stable perovskite NCs  To investigate the potential application of the CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer to the UV-based communication link  we measured the small-signal modulation bandwidth of the CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs using the setup shown in Fig  4a  To eliminate the bandwidth constraints from the emitter and other parts of the receiver  we used a 70-mW 375-nm UV laser diode ( LD ) with a high-modulation bandwidth of up to a few GHz and a Si-based avalanche PD ( APD ) with a device area of 02 mm and a tuneable gain of up to 5 × 105 V/W  The UV light was guided through a plano-convex lens and focused onto the CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer inside the integrating sphere  Another series of plano-convex lenses and an objective lens was set up at the output port to collect the photons re-emitted from the CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer  Before entering the APD  the UV light was filtered using a 500-nm LP filter  By sweeping the sinusoidal AC modulation signal from 300 kHz to 3 GHz  as shown in Fig  4b  the 3-dB bandwidth of the system without CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs is determined to be approximately 380 MHz  With the addition of the CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer and 500-nm LP filter  a 3-dB bandwidth of approximately 7092 MHz is obtained  The gradual dip at 10 MHz arises from the overall frequency response of the system when the CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs are inserted into the integrating sphere  The origin of this phenomenon has not been explicitly identified  although it is commonly observed when additional materials  optics or optical components are inserted into the communication channel  Such a gradual dip is within the −3 dB bandwidth  and this can be corrected through power pre-equalisation or post-equalisation in the eventual system implementation using electronic hardware or software processing  Apart from the enhanced responsivity relative to the Si-based PD  we posit that the demonstrated bandwidth has great potential for integration with a high-speed Si-based PD targeted at the UVC communication link  By taking advantage of the short carrier recombination lifetime ( ~ns )  the demonstrated modulation bandwidth under UV excitation is significantly higher than that in the case of YAM : Eu3+-based ( ~ms ) 41  Sr5 ( PO4 ) 3−x ( BO3 ) xCl:004Eu2+-based ( ~µs ) 19  and Ca8MgLu1−x ( PO4 ) 7 : xTb3+-based ( ~ms ) phosphors18  The high-modulation bandwidth demonstrated in CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs also surpasses those of other colloidal semiconductor NC-based PDs  eg  CdSe quantum dots ( ~50 kHz ) 42  Moreover  although some of the published studies have demonstrated a high modulation bandwidth of up to hundreds of megahertz204344  reduced absorption and a low PLQY in the UV region were also observed  which restricts the application of these materials in the UV communication field  Fig  4 : Modulation bandwidth measurement using CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs  figure 4 a Schematic diagram of the small-signal frequency response measurement setup using a 375-nm UV laser diode ( LD ) and a Si-based avalanche photodiode ( APD ) to obtain the results in ( b )  b The normalised frequency response of the UV LD and APD without CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs and a 500-nm long-pass filter is shown by the black line  The red line shows the frequency response of CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs measured using the UV LD and APD with the UV light filtered by a 500-nm long-pass filter Full size image We further demonstrated the potential of the CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer as a colour-converting luminescent material for Si-based PDs in the solar-blind UVC communication link by using the on–off keying ( OOK ) modulation scheme  In the OOK modulation  a pseudorandom binary sequence 210–1 data format was sent to optically modulate the transmitter  where the 1 or 0 s of the digital data were represented by the presence or absence of the carrier wave  respectively  As shown in Fig  5a  we used a 278-nm UVC LED to excite the CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer in the integrating sphere  while the green luminescence was passed through a series of plano-convex lenses  an objective lens  and a 500-nm LP filter before entering the Si-based APD  A DC bias of 6 V and an AC modulated peak-to-peak voltage of 2 Vp–p were supplied to the LED  At 6-V DC bias  the emitted light output power was measured to be approximately 08 mW  The corresponding L–I–V curves and light emission spectrum of the 278-nm LED can be found in Supplementary Fig  S9  At both the transmitter and receiver ends  the devices were connected to a bit-error-rate ( BER ) tester  The distance between the UVC LED and the CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer was 35 cm  while the distance from the CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer to the Si-based APD was approximately 20 cm  For comparison  we also measured the BER achieved at different data rates in the case of the UV LED only without the CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer and 500-nm LP filter  as shown in Fig  5b  We used an optical density ( OD ) filter of 16 to reduce the optical power illuminating the APD  where the measured illuminated power before the APD was approximately 0531 µW  well below the saturation limit of the APD  Prior to this  the system bandwidth was also measured  as shown in Fig  S10  where the 3-dB bandwidth was limited to 1113 MHz owing to the limitations at the transmitter end  In the case of the UVC LED only  the highest achievable data rate was recorded as 25 Mbps  with a measured BER of 14 × 10−3  below the forward error correction ( FEC ) limit of 38 × 10−3  The inset of Fig  5b shows the corresponding eye diagram with an SNR ratio of approximately 388 and a near-closed eye diagram for data rates above the FEC limit  With the colour-converting CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer  higher data rates of 34 Mbps and an SNR of 324 are achieved  as shown in Fig  5c  owing to the higher optical sensitivity of the Si-based APD to green wavelengths instead of UV wavelengths  The inset of Fig  5c shows the corresponding eye diagram at 34 Mbps  In the case of CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs  the measured optical power illuminating the APD after the 500-nm LP filter is 0508 µW  Given the similar optical powers illuminating the APD at two different wavelengths  ie  278 and 506 nm  a higher amplitude of the output voltage ( Vout )  a higher received signal power  and a high SNR in the case of the CsPbBr3 perovskite layer can be expected on the basis of the following equation : ( 4 ) whereVout is the output voltage  Pilluminance is the power illuminating the APD  Rλ is the responsivity of the Si-based APD at different wavelengths  and G is the transimpedance gain  By using a colour-converting luminescent material at the receiver end  Dong et al  demonstrated enhanced signal and optical gain compared to a communication link directly using a blue LED20  However  in their work  low absorption was observed in the UV wavelength region  which restricted the application of their material to a UV-based communication link  We envisage that the achieved data rates can be further improved by using a more complex modulation scheme ( eg  orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing )  pre-equalisation  bit loading and power allocation  Moreover  with the improvement in the modulation bandwidth of the solar-blind UVC LED and realisation of the UVC LD  a higher modulation bandwidth of up to hundreds of megahertz can be expected in the near future  Fig  5 : Data transmission measurement using CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs  figure 5 a Schematic diagram

summarises recently reported phosphor-based devices for optical wireless communication  Although the modulation bandwidth of the CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer is lower than that in the prior work by Dursun et al2  the PLQY in the present work is significantly higher by approximately 30 % when the NCs are drop-cast in the form of a thin film  and thus  a higher photon conversion efficiency is exhibited that can improve photodetection  Moreover  the lower modulation bandwidth in the present work compared to prior work could be attributed to the competing band states and dynamics of recombination mechanisms in the CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs4546  However  thorough investigations are still required to understand the mechanisms so that one can potentially manipulate the recombination dynamics favourable for the design of perovskite-based optoelectronic devices in the future  Compared to other prior works  our study highlighted the superior performance of the CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer with a high-PLQY and a fast-PL decay time for a novel receiver design and potential monolithic integration with a Si-based receiver in a UV-based communication link  Table 1 Comparison of phosphor-based devices for optical wireless communication Full size table In this study  a CsPbBr3 perovskite NC layer with a high PLQY ( ~73 % ) and a fast PL decay time ( 45 ns ) was demonstrated as a colour-converting luminescent material for a novel UV photodetection scheme based on a low-cost and mature Si-based PD platform  Remarkably  nearly three-fold improvement in the responsivity and an approximately 25 % increase in the EQE were observed  We also showed that it is possible to use the hybrid CsPbBr3-silicon colour convertor to achieve a large small-signal modulation bandwidth of 7092 MHz and a high data rate of up to 34 Mbps in a solar-blind UVC communication link  Our approach based on a composition-tuneable perovskite-based phosphor exploits the feasibility of monolithic integration with low-cost and mature Si-based devices for high-speed UV photodetection  This study opens a new pathway for utilisation of perovskite-based material systems benefiting both terrestrial and underwater UV-internet systems  Materials and methods CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs preparation and characterisation The CsPbBr3 QD solution was obtained from Quantum Solutions LLC ( wwwquantum-solutionscom )  The QDs have oleic acid and oleylamine as ligands on the surface and are dispersed in toluene  with a QD concentration of approximately 20 mg/mL  TEM was performed on a Titan G2 80–300 ( FEI Co ) operating at 300 kV  High-resolution TEM was carried out using an aberration-corrected and monochromated FEI Titan G2 80–300  Images were recorded on a charge coupled device ( CCD ) camera ( 2 k × 62 k  Gatan model 895 ) with a binning mode of two  Sample preparation for TEM was performed by diluting the QD solution using toluene  which was drop-cast onto a formvar/carbon-coated 300 mesh copper TEM grid for analysis  The CsPbBr3 NC layer was drop-cast onto a UV quartz substrate and dried to allow solvent evaporation for optical characterisation  With regard to UV–VIS absorption and PL characterisations  the steady-state reflection spectra were recorded using an Edinburg F900 spectrometer with an integrating sphere  Then  the Kubelka–Munk relation was used to convert the reflectance data into absorption spectra for CsPbBr3 NCs on the UV quartz substrate  The steady-state PL and time-resolved PL were recorded using an Edinburg F900 and a FluoroMax®-4 spectrometer  respectively  For time-resolved PL measurements  the instrument works on the principle of time-correlated single-photon counting ( TCSPC ) ; a 372-nm laser pulse was used as the excitation light source  Photoelectrical measurement A 500-W Hg ( Xe ) arc lamp ( Newport  66142 ) was used as the light source and guided into a monochromator ( CornerstoneTM  CS260 ) for wavelength tuning  The output light was then guided through a series of optical lenses and focused onto the input port of the integrating sphere ( Newport  819 series )  The inner surface of the integrating sphere was coated with PTFE  A Si-based PIN junction photodiode ( Thorlabs  FDS100 ) with the borosilicate window removed was mounted on the output port of the integrating sphere  Modulation bandwidth measurement The setup consisted of a 375-nm LD ( Thorlabs  L375P70MLD ) mounted on a thermoelectric cooler ( TEC )  The output signal from a vector network analyser ( Agilent  E5061B ) was connected to the LD  The light was guided through UV plano-convex lenses ( Thorlabs  LA1951A & Edmund Optics  No  36–689 ) into the integrating sphere  The light re-emitted from CsPbBr3 NCs was filtered by a 500-nm LP filter ( Thorlabs  FELH0500 ) and passed through two plano-convex lenses ( Thorlabs  LA4148 and LA4052 ) and an objective lens ( Thorlabs  LMU15X ) before being collected by a Si-based APD ( Thorlabs  APD430A2 )  The APD was connected to the vector network analyser  The vector network analyser was pre-calibrated with an E-calibration module ( Agilent  85093–60010 ) before the experiment  Data transmission measurement A UVC LED ( LG Innotek  LEUVA66H70HF00 ) was modulated through a bias tee ( Mini-Circuits  ZFBT-4R2GW-FT+ ) and connected to a BERT transmitter ( Anritsu  ME522A )  Two plano-convex lenses ( Thorlabs  LA4148 and LA4052 ) and an objective lens ( Thorlabs  LMU15X ) were used to guide the incoming light onto the Si-based APD  In the case of CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs  a 500-nm LP filter ( Thorlabs  FELH0500 ) was added  For the UVC LED only  UV ND filters ( Thorlabs  NDUV10A and NDUV06A ) were added to reduce the light power and maintain it below the saturation power of the APD  The signal received from the APD was analysed by the BERT receiver ( Anritsu  ME522A )  The eye diagrams were simultaneously captured using a digital communication analyser ( Agilent  86100C Infiniium DCA-J Wideband Oscilloscope ) Recent developments in perovskite solar cells have achieved efficiency around 22 %  However  degradation of perovskite material on contact with moisture is still an issue  In this study  inverted planar perovskite solar cells via solution processing at low temperature are prepared with different electron transport layers  The zinc oxide and aluminum doped zinc oxide are used as electron selective layer between PCBM and back contact  The metal oxides act as protective layer resulting in increased stability against moisture  Furthermore  this interlayer improves charge transfer and collection  leading to significantly increased short circuit current density and fill factor  The champion cell with power

with the sky rocketed power conversion efficiencies-PCEs of 227 % ( Kojima et al  2009 ; Green et al  2018 ) while maintaining flexibility and low cost facile processing  The unprecedented attainments are credited to materials intriguing properties ie  broad range absorption ( 800 nm )  strong absorption coefficient ( ~ 15 × 10−4 /cm )  optimal and tunable band gap ( 13–29 eV )  long exciton diffusion length ( ~ 01–1 µm )  excellent carrier mobility and life time ( ~ 100 ns ) and thermal stability ( up to 300 °C ) ( Jeng et al  2014 ; Pang et al  2014 ; Chen et al  2015a ; Bai et al  2016 ; Mahmood et al  2017 )  Generated excitons  in the vicinity of perovskite are loosely bonded and require only a minimal amount of force ( 37–50 meV ) to create free charge carriers ( Kim et al  2014 ; Yang et al  2017 )  Moreover  ~ 100 % internal quantum efficiencies-IPCE of PrSCs exhibit negligible recombination that ensure higher conversion efficiency ( Chiang and Wu 2016 )  The exquisite success to apply remarkable properties of perovskites materials in photovoltaics were not actualized without the optimization of perovskite layer and device structure  The various symbiotic device architectures include MAPbX3 ( X = I  Cl  Br ) material sandwiched between mesoporous metal oxide ( TiO2  Al2O3 ) and back contact  Although the champion efficiency obtained is for mesoscopic TiO2 scaffold but inhomogeneous infiltration of perovskite and high sintering temperature ( ~ 500 °C ) precludes large scale production as well as use of plastic substrates ( Lee et al  2012a  b ; Ugur et al  2017 )  In addition  the direct exposure of perovskite layer to moisture in this structure makes the devices vulnerable to degradation ( Wang et al  2016 )  To overcome this limitation and to avoid pore filling issue  low temperature fabrication of planar structure with p–i–n and n–i–p geometries makes them suitable for large scale flexible production  Here  “ i ” is the perovskite based light absorber and “ p ”  “ n ” are interfacial layers that serve for charge separation and hole  electron transport  respectively ( You et al  2015 )  A careful selection of interfacial layers ensure efficient charge extraction and transportation at electrodes and can also benefit the device stability ( Wu et al  2014 )  Many organic and inorganic materials as electron transport layer–ETL ( PCBM  ICBA  TiO2  ZrO2  Al2O3  ZnO ) ( Lee et al  2012a  b  b ; Bi et al  2013 ; You et al  2015 ) and hole transport layer-HTL ( PEDOT : PSS  spiro OMeTAD   PTAA and P3HT NiOx  CuOx  Cu2O  SnO2   CuSCN  CuI  ) have been reported ( Qin et al  2014 ; You et al  2015 ; Chang et al  2016 ; Jiang et al  2017 ; Yin et al  2017 ; Zhou et al  2017 )  Recently  n–i–p planar PrSCs ( conventional ) have been reported with the certified PCE of 209 % ( Jiang et al  2017 ) but inverted device structure employing fullerene derivative PCBM  ICBA as ETL are of tremendous interest in research  Such device structures are promising because of negligible hysteresis  long term stability and being a suitable choice to use as rear cell in tandem architecture ( Bai et al  2015 ; Jiang et al  2017 )  However  the direct exposure of PCBM with oxygen/water and the chemical reaction between perovskite and metal back contact at thinner ETL sites result in poor stability of devices  As validated in organic solar studies  the energy level mismatch between direct PCBM/metal contacts reduces the carrier selectivity and electron extraction  Therefore  the selection of n-type material that serves not only as charge transport material but also avoid the direct PCBM metal contact has become critical for device stability and energy level alignment  In this study  a thin layer of ZnO or Al : ZnO nanoparticles-NPs on top of PCBM was employed  These metal oxide NPs have high carrier mobility  optical transparency  environmental stability and suitable work function that provide larger interfacial area and support to overcome degradation ( You et al  2015 ; Chang et al  2016 )  With the inclusion of ZnO/Al : ZnO capping layer the device performance only drop ~ 25 % after 480 h  while the devices without the interlayer drop down to ~ 0 in 48 h Besides  the PCE was also increased from ~ 7 to ~ 11 %  Experimental details Materials Indium tin oxide-ITOs ( 8–12 Ω ) patterned on glass substrates were received from Delta Technologies  USA  The conjugated polymer poly ( 34 ethylene dioxythiophene polystyrenesulfonate ) -PEDOT : PSS was purchased from Heraeus Material Technology LLC  USA  Methylammonium iodide–MAI ( 98 % )  lead iodide—PbI2 ( 99 % )  N11 ZnO NPs ( 8–16 nm ) and N10 Al : ZnO ( < 50 nm )  γ-buytrolacton ( > = 99 % ) and dimethyl sulfoxide—DMSO were all obtained from Sigma–Aldrich  PCBM ( 9999 % ) was purchased from Solenne  Device fabrication Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of experimental steps involved in the device fabrication  At first  a thin layer of PEDOT : PSS was spin coated on pre-cleaned ITOs at 5000 rpm/30sec and baked on hot plate at 150 °C/15 min  The photoactive perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving MAI and PbI2 ( 1:1 ) in a co-solvent of DMSO and GBL ( 4:6 )  The active layer solution was spun cast on baked PEDOT : PSS film at 4000 rpm/50 s and quenched at 20 s by dropping chlorobenzene  These films were heated at 85 °C for exactly 10 min Subsequently  30 mg/ml of PCBM was deposited on ITO/PEDOT : PSS/Perovskite layer at 1500 rpm followed by 2 min heating at 85 °C  Fig  1 figure 1 Schematic diagram of experimental procedure Full size image The purchased ZnO and Al : ZnO NPs ( 25 wt % in IPA ) were further diluted with IPA ( 1:1 )  The diluted NPs were deposited on top of PCBM at 3000 rpm  Finally  Al was thermally evaporated at 10−7 mbar to form a back contact ( 100 nm )  defining 6 devices on each substrate with active area of 01 cm2  Characterization Current density vs Voltage ( J–V ) curves were recorded using integrated source meter ( Keithley 2420 ) unit and solar simulator ( CT 100 AAA ) with xenon lamp  The irradiation intensity was calibrated at 1000 Wm−2 using standard silicon cell  UV–Vis spectrograph of the device ( without back contact ) was obtained through Genesys 10S  QEX 10PV was used to collect external quantum efficiency measurements-EQE of the fabricated devices  The roughness and morphologies of the films were observed by atomic force microscopy-AFM and scanning electron microscopy- SEM ( JSM-6490  Joel Japan )  Results and discussion Figure 2 displays highest occupied molecular orbital–HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital–LUMO of each layer of the inverted PrSCs  The appropriate energy level alignment of CH3NH3PbI3 ( HOMO ~ 54  LUMO ~ 39 ) eV  PCBM ( HOMO ~ 67  LUMO ~ 42 ) eV and PEDOT : PSS ( 53 eV ) permit efficient electron hole extraction at interfaces ( Jeng et al  2013 )  Upon the absorption of light  excitons are generated and dissociated in CH3NH3PbI3  The charges are then effectively separated at CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM and PEDOT : PSS/ CH3NH3PbI3 interface and collected at their respective electrodes  The deeper band edge of well-known hole transport layer PEDOT : PSS relative to work function of ITO prevents hole leakage from ITO to perovskite layer ( Chen et al  2015b )  Fig  2 figure 2 a The fabricated device configuration  b Energy level diagram Full size image The alignment of energy levels of ZnO and Al : ZnO expected to enhance electron transport efficiency between layers  Moreover  deeper valance band level of oxide NPs than PCBM could efficiently block holes to reach the back contact  J–V curves of PrSCs obtained in forward scan under 1000Wm−2 irradiation intensity and AM15G conditions are shown in Fig  3a  The device performance for control device—ITO/PEDOT : PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/Al labelled as D1 and double ETL based PrSCs comprising of PCBM/Al : ZnO as D2 and PCBM/ZnO as D3 are summarized in Table 1  Fig  3 figure 3 a J–V graphs of inverted devices D1  D2 and D3  b Distribution of PCEs values as obtained from 20 pixels  c Stability study for D1  D2 and D3 Full size image Table 1 J–V data of inverted devices D1  D2 and D3 Full size table The control device manifests PCE of 741 % with open circuit voltage ( Voc ) 077V  current density ( Jsc ) 1761 mA/cm2 and fill factor ( FF ) 5421 %  Following similar experimental conditions  inclusion of ZnO and Al : ZnO NPs on top of PCBM significantly increased device parameters resulting in PCEs over 12 %  The work functions of charge transport layers significantly affect the Voc of PrSCs ( Zuo and Ding 2017 )  The increase in Jsc of D2 and D3 is assigned to decrease in charge recombination ( Zhu et al  2014 )  The main factors affecting Jsc include light harvesting efficiency  exciton dissociation  charge transfer and collection at the electrodes ( Chiang and Wu 2016 )  In inverted structure  the photo dissociated electrons require 04 ns to be collected at the Al electrode after passing PCBM and holes travel through the PEDOT : PSS and reach ITO in less than a nanosecond ( Xing et al  2013 )  This unbalanced charge transport results in recombination losses  In our devices  electrons have to travel through PCBM as well as ZnO/Al : ZnO layer to reach and collected at back contact  A long carrier diffusion length and deeper VB of metal oxides benefit the charge collection efficiency  resulting in higher Jsc  Higher FF in double ETL devices is established by the balance between electron and hole transfer towards the respective electrodes  Inclusion of capping layers ( ZnO and Al : ZnO ) assure balanced charge transport to the corresponding electrodes and decreases charge recombination thereby increasing the FF and Jsc ( Wu et al  2014 )  The increased values of Rsh indicate that capping layers acts as a buffer and reduce the leakage current  Figure 3b shows the histogram of three devices structure for 20 pixels  The performance of PCBM : ZnO/Al : ZnO double ETL based devices is averagely higher than PCBM  The stability of devices with and without ZnO/Al : ZnO interlayers were tested under ambient conditions ( 25 °C and ~ 35 % humidity ) for 480 h From Fig  3c  a drastic decrease in PCE of D1 was found and dropped down to ~ 0 in 48 h This degradation can be attributed to the adsorption of oxygen/water by PCBM as well as perovskite active material  On the other hand  ZnO and Al : ZnO being environmentally stable act as a protective layer for PCBM and perovskite and retained the device performance for up to 480 h The PCE for D2 and D3 dropped down to ~ 79 and 75 %  respectively  The absorption spectra of prepared CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM films with 1:1 molar ratio are shown in Fig  4a indicating strong characteristic absorption range from 325 to 800 nm ( Wu et al  2015 ; Yan et al  2017 )  The absorption profile shows two distinct peaks appearing around 475 and 760 nm  The first energy band of 261 eV correspond to the direct transition from lower valance band to the conduction band and the second band absorption edge is attributed to the direct transition correspond to 163 eV as reported ( A et al  2016 )  The absorbance of perovskite film with PCBM has less intensity below 450 nm as compared to the films with capping layer evident the presence of ZnO and Al : ZnO layers ( Lai et al  2015 )  Slight red shift observed in perovskite film with PCBM/Al : ZnO below 400 nm is credited to the absorption of Al : ZnO  Figure 4b displays EQE as function of wavelength for the devices  In agreement with the J–V graph  the devices D2 and D3 have higher EQE values than the PCBM device  In this study  light harvesting is same for all devices  so the improvement of EQE resulted from the improved charge transfer and collection due to the presence of ZnO and Al : ZnO ( Heo et al  2015 )  Fig  4 figure 4 a UV–Vis absorption spectra of D1  D2 and D3 layers  b EQE plot of inverted devices D1  D2 and D3 Full size image Figure 5 shows SEM cross sectional micrograph of all devices  As indicated by red circle ( Fig  5D1 )  PCBM does not provide perovskite active layer coverage properly  At thinner PCBM sites  metal contact can directly come in contact with perovskite layer  In addition  aluminum contact deposited directly onto PCBM can penetrate as deep as 10 nm into the layer that can result in direct connection between perovskite and metal contact at thinner ETL locations ( Qiu et al  2015 ; You et al  2015 )  When a thin layer of NPs is deposited on PCBM it offers a homogeneous coverage ( Fig  5D2  D3 ) and act as a capping layer to prevent direct contact of PCBM and Al  This capping layer improved the device stability relative to PCBM only ETL based devices as described earlier in Fig  3c  Fig  5 figure 5 Cross sectional SEM of D1  D2 and D3 films Full size image Figure 6a–c show topography and SEM micrographs of D1  D2 and D3 films  respectively  PCBM coated CH3NH3PbI3 film  Fig  6a  d show a good coverage with surface roughness of ( root mean square -RMS value ) of 87 nm  With NPs  roughness decreased to 58 and 64 nm for D2 and D3 layers implying that nanoparticles have formed a film without changing the surface morphology of active layer  The reduced RMS values ensure excellent contact with Al ( top electrode ) that intern reduces recombination at the interface and improves device reproducibility ( Fig  3b ) ( Savva et al  2016 )  The SEM micrographs of surface morphology of PCBM on top of perovskite and NPs/PCBM/perovskite show small and large grains distribution morphology on the film surface  On the contrary  the film with ZnO/Al : ZnO on top ( e–f ) has the small quantity of grains indicating good coverage of film protects against metal sputtering  Fig  6 figure 6 a–c AFM micrograph and d–f SEM images of inverted films of D1  D2 and D3  respectively Full size image Conclusion The study herein presented the metal oxides as potential solution based ETL for further development of efficient and stable PrSCs  ZnO and Al : ZnO NPs have been employed on top of PCBM in separate set of the devices  Metal oxides being environmentally stable acts as effective capping layer and offer pronounced increment in device stability  The performance of the devices employing ETLs ( metal oxide on top of PCBM ) only drop to ~ 25 % after 480 h  while the devices without the interlayer degraded completely in 48 h Furthermore  the proposed ETL provides an extra energetic barrier for holes and reduces leakage current as indicated with Rsh values  Insertion of capping layer increased the roughness and absorption intensity of perovskite films gradually and similar trend was observed in EQE curves  This enhancement in EQE was attributed to improve absorption  charge transfer and collection  These improved mechanism results in enhanced electrical parameters and the efficiency of PCBM/ZnO and PCBM/Al : ZnO based devices increased about 7 and 11 %  respectivelyCommercial available carbon paste was screen-printed instead of both the expensive hole transport materials ( HTM ) and noble metal electrode  and the fully-air processed perovskite solar cells based on Al-doped TiO2 nanorods arrays was fabricated and demonstrated the enhanced photo-electronic conversion efficiencies  Study show that aluminum doping changes the flat band of TiO2 nanorods and influence the open voltage  Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy shows that the resistance of the Al-doped TiO2 nanorods devices using commercial available carbon instead of HTM and noble metal electrode is higher than that of the un-doped devices  resulting in slower electron recombination rates  longer electron lifetimes and higher energy conversion efficiencies  Al-doped perovskite devices based on commercial available carbon achieve a PCE of 608 % in ambient atmosphere  which is 19 % higher than that of the undoped sample  This method greatly simplifies the process of the perovskite solar cell fabrication and opens a door toward the cheap and stable and printable solar cell based on commercial available carbon  Similar content being viewed by others

Screen-Printable Hole-Transport Material-Free Mesoscopic Perovskite Solar Cells with a Carbon Electrode Article 20 June 2019 1 Introduction Perovskite solar cells are a new type of lower cost solid-state solar cell with high photoelectric conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) and a simple preparation process [ 1  2 ]  Since 2009  the PCE values of perovskite solar cells have risen rapidly from 381 % to higher than 22 % [ 3  4 ]  A perovskite solar cell consists of a mesoporous metal-oxide scaffold [ 5678 ]  an organometal halide perovskite light harvester [ 9101112 ]  hole transport materials ( HTM ) [ 13  14 ] and a metal counter electrode  Grätzel and coauthors achieved a PCE value of 15 % solar cell prepared with mesoporous TiO2  For this material  the open-circuit voltage was closer to 1 V and the fill factor ( FF ) reached 073  indicating minimal internal recombination in perovskite solar cells [ 2 ]  Recently  Yella et al  prepared a perovskite cell containing rutile titanium dioxide using a low-temperature solution growth method and achieved a conversion efficiency of 137 % [ 15 ]  These results indicate that TiO2 may play an important role as the electron collector in perovskite solar cells  However  mesoporous TiO2 also has a complex internal pore structure and grain boundaries  which would produce more defects [ 16 ]  A variety of nano-materials has been attracted for appilication in energy conservation and storage devices  including photovoltaic devices  supercapacitors  etc  The advantages of using nano-materials is arising from their versatile surface area  morphology and super electrochemical properties [ 17 ]  One-dimensional TiO2 nanorod arrays can solve problems caused by the mesoporous layer due to its one-dimension vertical electron transfer channel and has been shown to have smaller internal grain boundaries and fewer defects than the TiO2 particles  Qiu et al  grew rutile TiO2 nanowires using a hydrothermal process for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells with a PCE of 487 % [ 18 ]  Park and coworkers also hydrothermally prepared TiO2 nanorods measuring 560 nm in length  and achieved a higher PCE for rutile TiO2 nanorods ( 94 % ) [ 19 ]  In addition  enhanced pore filling of the perovskite and HTM in the solar cell is beneficial for obtaining higher PCE values [ 20 ]  TiO2 nanorod and nanotube array structures are better suited for the infiltration of the perovskite and HTM  Moreover  recent literature shows that the electron recombination in TiO2 nanorods and nanotubes are less than that of TiO2 particles in dye-sensitized solar cells ( DSSCs ) [ 21 ]  In general  TiO2 nanorod can be doped using metal or nonmetal elements in order to change the material properties and further improve the PCE of DSSCs [ 22232425 ]  Adding various elements to TiO2 is also helpful for improving properties in the visible light region [ 25 ]  Burda et al  enhanced nitrogen doping in TiO2 nanoparticles  and observed a significant extending into the visible region up to 600 nm [ 26 ]  Sobhani-Nasab and coworkers successfully fabricated Ag-doped nickel titanate nanoparticles and developed an inexpensive FTO/TiO2/Ag–NiTiO3/Pt–FTO solar cell due to its unique electro-optical characteristic [ 27 ]  Ziarati et al  reported that doping of rare earth ions can also improve the electric  magnetic and catalytic properties [ 28 ]  Studies also showed that ion dopants can also extend the lifetime of electrons within DSSCs [ 23  24 ]  Compared to the other components  HTM ( such as Spiro-OMeTAD ) and the noble metal electrode ( Ag or Au ) account for a large proportion of the costs for perovskite solar cells  which limits their commercial application  In addition  the evaporation process for the metal electrode requires vacuum conditions  resulting in a large amount of energy consumption and hindering further large-scale production  Therefore  the development of hole–transport-free perovskite solar cells and alternative noble metallic electrode materials is important for reducing costs in solar cells  With respect to the noble electrode  carbon is not only inexpensive and simple to prepare but also easy to use as the counter electrode  which could reduce production costs and streamline the operation processes of devices [ 29 ]  Carbon-based materials like carbon nanotubes and activated carbon  carbon fibers and carbon aerogels  as well as graphene  have proven to be a very promising candidate for use in solar cells and supercapacitors stemming from its superior properties and cheap processing [ 30 ]  In this work  one-dimensional Al-doped rutile TiO2 nanorods were successfully synthesized using a hydrothermal method  EDS measurements show trace amounts of Al doped in the nanorods  Al doping reduces the band gap of TiO2 from 301 to 299 eV  Commercial available carbon was used instead of HTM and noble metal electrode in the perovskite solar cells  Al-doped perovskite devices based on commercial available carbon achieve a PCE of 608 % in ambient atmosphere  which is 19 % higher than that of the un-doped sample  This method greatly simplifies the process of the perovskite solar cell fabrication and opens a door toward the cheap and stable and printable solar cell based on commercial available carbon  2 Experiments section 21 Growth of TiO2 nanorods The fluorine-doped tin oxide ( FTO ) conductive glass was etched by Zn powder and HCl solution  then cleaned with detergent  acetone  isopropyl alcohol and deionized water in an ultrasonic cleaning instrument  respectively  30 ml of hydrochloric acid was added into 30 ml of deionized water and stirred for about 10 min in the fume cupboard  Then  1 ml of titanium isopropoxide was added to the mixed solution  After stirring for another 10 min  the solution was transferred into a 90 ml Teflon-lined autoclave with clean FTO glass  The sealed autoclave was heated to 423 K and kept for 35 h and then cooled to room temperature naturally  The glass coated with TiO2 nanorods arrays was rinsed with deionized water and annealed at 723 K in air for 30 min  After cooling down to room temperature  the TiO2 nanorods were treated with 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 343 K for 30 min  then calcinated at 723 K for another 30 min  To synthesis the Al-doped TiO2 nanorods  0081 g aluminium isopropoxide was added to the precursor solution before hydrothermal preparation  22 Synthesis of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite precursor solution CH3NH3PbI3−xClx was synthesized according to previous reports  Typically  40 ml methylamine ( 33 wt % in ethanol ) and 30 ml hydroiodic acid ( 57 wt % in water ) were reacted in a 250 ml round-bottom flask at 273 K for 2 h with stirring  The precipitate was collected by carefully removing the solvents with a rotary evaporator at 323 K The as-obtained product was washed three times with diethyl ether  and recrystallized from a mixed solvent of diethyl ether and ethanol  After filtration  the product was dried at 333 K in a vacuum oven for 24 h Then 0421 g CH3NH3I powder and 0246 g PbCl2 was dissolved in 1 g anhydrous N  N-dimethylformamide to synthesize CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite precursor solution  23 Solar cell fabrication TiO2 nanorods were firstly spin-coated with CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite precursor solution at 3000 RPM for 30 s in air  followed by annealed on the heating plate at 378 K for 45 min immediately  After that  the commercial carbon paste ( Shenzhen DongDaLai Chemical Co  Ltd ) which consists of carbon black  graphite and acrylic resin was deposited on the film by screen-printing technique  and dried at 373 K for 30 min  All these procedures were carried out on naturally ambient atmosphere  The active area was defined as 009 cm2 by a black mask during photoelectric measurements  24 Characterization The cross-sectional morphologies of Al-doped TiO2 and full cell were measured by a Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope ( FESEM )  The phases of the Al-doped TiO2 nanorod were investigated by X-ray diffraction ( XRD  SmartLab  Rigaku )  Photocurrent and voltage were measured by a Keithley 2400 source meter and a solar simulator ( Oriel 94023A ) equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp ( Newport 6279NS )  The output power was adjusted to match AM15 global sunlight  which was calibrated by a certified reference silicon solar cell  Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS ) measurement was performed with alternating current amplitude of 75 mV over the frequency range of 1 Hz to 100 kHz  Ultraviolet–visible ( UV–Vis ) spectrum measurements were conducted using a Lambda 950 spectrophotometer  3 Results and discussion The morphology and structure of the non-doped and Al-doped TiO2 nanorods were investigated using FESEM and shown in Fig  1  We observed that the TiO2 nanorods uniformly grow on the FTO glass with a quadrilateral cross-section ( Fig  1a )  Figure 1b shows a sectional view of TiO2 nanorod array  the uniformly aligned TiO2 nanorod arrays have a length of 435 and a width of 110 nm  respectively  Figure 1c  d show the top and sectional SEM view of the Al-doped TiO2 nanorods using aluminum isopropoxide as a precursor  Al-doped nanorods maintain the rod-like structure with good uniformity  The length of nanorods is about 540 nm while the width decreases to 90 nm  illustrating that the incorporation of Al accelerates the growth rate of the nanorods and reduce the width of the rod simultaneously  Fig  1 figure 1 Surface and cross-section FESEM of TiO2 nanorods array  a  b Non-doped TiO2 nanorods array  c  d Al-doped TiO2 nanorods array Full size image As shown in Fig  2a  the XRD patterns of both the non-doped and Al-doped TiO2 nanorods included peaks at the 2θ values of 268°  364°  548°  and 633°  which correspond to the ( 110 )  ( 101 )  ( 211 ) and ( 002 ) crystal planes of rutile TiO2  respectively  ( JCPDS 21-1276 ) [ 15 ]  From XRD data  the crystallite size of non-doped and Al-doped TiO2 nanorods were calculated to be about 367 and 293 nm based on the Scherrer equation : [ 17 ] { text { Dc } } = { text { K } } lambda /beta { text { cos } } theta In which β represents the breadth of the diffraction line at its half intensity maximum ( 101 )  K is the shape factor ( usually about 09 )  and λ shows the wavelength of X-ray source  Also  we can see that the intensity of rutile peak ( 101 ) is relatively weakened after doping  which could be due to the Al doped into the lattice of TiO2 and influence the crystal growth  XRD diffraction spectrum in Fig  2b shows CH3NH3PbI3−xClx was spun onto the Al-doped TiO2 nanorods grown on FTO glass  After the perovskite deposition  excluding the diffraction peak of basement FTO and rutile TiO2  the new peaks at 2θ ≈ 131°  142°  200°  239°  285°  320°  406° and 432°  could be indexed to the ( 002 )  ( 110 )  ( 112 )  ( 211 )  ( 220 )  ( 310 )  ( 224 ) and ( 314 ) crystal faces of the tetragonal perovskite  respectively [ 18 ]  The prepared CH3NH3PbI3−xClx has a good crystallinity and belongs to the cubic crystal phase  Fig  2 figure 2 a XRD patterns of non-doped and Al-doped TiO2 nanorod arrays ; b XRD diffraction spectrum of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx spun onto vertically oriented TiO2 nanorods array on FTO glass Full size image In order to further ensure the existence of Al3+  high-resolution electron microscopy was used to measure the energy dispersive spectrum of Al-doped TiO2 nanorods ( see Fig  3 )  Selected area elemental analysis indicates that the sample contains O  F  Al  Si  Ti  Sn elements  with O and Ti being major elements presented  F  Si  and Sn were also detected from the FTO conductive substrate and trace of Al was detected  indicating that Al was existed in the TiO2 film after the hydrothermal growth process  Fig  3 figure 3 EDS spectrum of Al-doped TiO2 nanorods and traces of Al were detected Full size image Figure 4a shows the UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the un-doped and Al-doped TiO2 nanorods  The reflectance spectrum of the Al-doped TiO2 nanorods from 500 to 700 nm is lower than that of the un-doped TiO2 nanorods  However  incorporation of Al changes the absorption spectrum in the visible region  Figure 4b shows the transformed Kubelka–Munk spectra of the un-doped and Al-doped TiO2 nanorods based on the diffuse reflectance data  The optical band gap of the undoped TiO2 nanorods was about 301 eV  which is consistent with the literature [ 31 ]  The band gap of the Al-doped TiO2 nanorods was 299 eV  It can be seen that the Al doping reduces the band gap of the titanium dioxide  This may be due to the formation of Ti–O–Al structure in the Al-doped TiO2 nanorod owing to the substitution of Ti by Al  leading to the reduction of conduction band [ 32 ]  The reducing conduction band could benefit for the enhanced electron injection from TiO2 to FTO and will increase the short-circuit current density of the device  Tafel plot of Al-doped and undoped TiO2 nanorods in 01 M Na2SO4 are shown in Fig  4c  The polarization curve of Al-doped nanorods shown a negative shift when compared with the undoped one  which means the negative shift of flat band potential ( Efb ) of TiO2 after Al-doping  It is well know that Voc is determined by the redox potential of the electrolyte and Efb of the electrode  the change of the Efb means the variation in the Voc of the device  Fig  4 figure 4 a UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra and b Tauc plot of un-doped and Al-doped TiO2 nanorods ; c Tafel plot of Al-doped and undoped TiO2 nanorods in 01 M Na2SO4 solution  Scan rate 1 mV/s Full size image The non-doped and Al-doped TiO2 nanorods were also used to fabricate hole–transport-free perovskite solar cells using carbon instead of both the expensive HTM and noble metal electrode ( Fig  5 )  Figure 5a is the schematic illustration of the device in this study  TiO2 nanorods arrays were synthesized on the FTO directly via hydrothermal method  The cross-sectional view of the carbon counter electrode is shown in Fig  5b  where the carbon electrode is mainly composed of flake graphite with a thickness of about 10 μm  Figure 5c shows that the perovskite penetrates the gap between the TiO2 nanorods and connect with the adjacent nanorods perfectly  Figure 5d shows the cell assembled using Al-doped TiO2 nanorods  where the thickness of perovskite and the TiO2 nanorods is about 1 μm  Fig  5 figure 5 a Schematic illustration of a typical device based on commercial available carbon  b

photoelectric performances of the solar cells were measured under simulated AM15 ( 100 mW/cm2 ) illumination  Table 1 lists the detailed photovoltaic parameters of the two different perovskite solar cells  The perovskite solar cell based on non-doped TiO2 nanorods possesses an open-circuit voltage ( Voc ) of 684 mV  a short-circuit current density ( Jsc ) of 1167 mA/cm2  and a FF of 51 %  resulting in an energy conversion efficiency of 513 %  These inferior performance parameters can be ascribed to the increased charge recombination which was confirmed by the following EIS investigation  In contrast  the Al-doped TiO2 nanorods based perovskite solar cell has a Voc  Jsc  and a FF of 738 mV  1273 mA/cm2  and 52 %  respectively  The PCE of the Al-doped perovskite device reaches 608 %  which is 19 % higher than the un-doped device ( 513 % ) under the same testing conditions  According to a previous analysis [ 33 ]  the introduction of Al into TiO2 improved the open-circuit voltage  but reduced short-circuit current  Interestingly  the short-circuit current in our device also shows an increase after Al doping  which is consistent with the IPCE results shown in Fig  6b  Fig  6 figure 6 I–V curves ( a ) and IPCE curves ( b ) of hole–transport-free perovskite solar cells with different nanorods and carbon counter electrode Full size image Table 1 List of characteristic performance parameters of perovskite solar cells Full size table In order to investigate the reliability of perovskite solar cells  15 independent devices were fabricated using the same procedure and characterized  The photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding devices are listed in Table 2  Clearly  the performance of the Al-doped device was significantly superior to those of the undoped device  In particular  the Voc is significantly improved due to the negative shifting of TiO2 flat band potential and lower charge recombination [ 34 ]  Interestingly  the Jsc is also increased by 9 %  the improvement of short-circuit current density is due to the fact that the doping of Al makes the enhanced electron injection from TiO2 to FTO  Table 2 Photovoltaic parameters ( average values of 15 devices ) for the perovskite solar cells with or without Al-doped Full size table Figure 7 shows the Nyquist plots of the perovskite solar cells  with a test frequency from 1 to 100 kHz and amplitude of 75 mV  The inset of Fig  7 is the equivalent circuit employed to model the experimental results obtained [ 35 ]  The semicircle at a high frequency in the Nyquist plot relates to the interface of TiO2/perovskite layer [ 36 ]  In this case  incorporation of Al influenced the contact of the nanorods and the perovskite and increases the transport resistance  The larger semicircle of the curve on the right side is generally considered to result from resistance associated with the recombination of electrons  and the size of this curve is proportional to the electron recombination resistance  A comparison of the two devices reveals that the transport resistance of Al-doped TiO2 nanorods is higher than that of the undoped one  which greatly increases of recombination resistance  so  the device based on Al-doped nanorods can get better efficiency than the undoped one  Fig  7 figure 7 Nyquist plots of perovskite solar cells with different nanorods and carbon counter electrode Full size image 4 Conclusion Commercial available carbon paste was screen-printed instead of both the expensive HTM and noble metal electrode  and the fully-air processed perovskite solar cells based on Al-doped TiO2 nanorods arrays was fabricated and demonstrated the enhanced photo-electronic conversion efficiencies  FESEM images show that the TiO2 nanorods are 435 nm in length and 110 nm in width  The incorporation of Al increases the length ( 540 nm ) and decreases the diameter ( 90 nm ) of the TiO2 nanorods  In addition  the Al-doped TiO2 nanorods reduce the band gap of TiO2 from 301 to 299 eV  The polarization curve show the negative shift of flat band potential ( Efb ) of TiO2 after Al-doping  Study shows that the devices based on Al-doped TiO2 nanorods have slower electron recombination rates  which show a 19 % increase in the overall conversion efficiency when compared with the non-doped TiO2 nanorodserovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) are arising as strong candidates for the next generation of thin-film photovoltaic techniques due to their high efficiency  low-cost  and simple manufacture process  A PSC usually is consisted of several components including in conductive bottom substrate  electron or hole transport layer  perovskite layer  and a counter electrode  However  PSCs are facing issues such as inaccurate evaluation of power conversion efficiency due to hysteresis  poor long-term stability  an inability for continuous manufacturing large area cells  and the use of noble metal as counter electrodes  In fact  a counter electrode is one of the key factors that govern the charge collection  long-term stability  and total cost of PSCs  Despite its importance  less attention has been paid to the exploration of counter electrode materials for PSCs  Here  we provided a summary of the recent development of counter electrode for PSCs  including metal thin-film electrode  super-thin metal thin-film electrode  nanostructured metal electrode  graphene electrode  carbon nanotube electrode  carbon black/graphite electrode  conductive oxide electrode  and polymer electrode  We highlighted findings of novel counter electrode

energy is increased dramatically  The limited fossil energy resource leads scientists to explore novel clean energy technology  such as solar energy  wind power  tidal energy  geothermal energy  and biomass energy to fulfill the energy demand of human being  Among those  converting solar energy to thermal energy  chemical energy  or electric energy is one of the effective ways to provide clean energy to a human being  Specifically  the conversion of solar energy to electricity is foreseen as an effective way of utilization of solar energy  In fact  since the first practical solar cell demonstrated in 1954 at Bell Laboratories  several generations of solar cells have been developed to realize this process  The first generation of solar cells is based on single- and multi-crystal silicon  whose efficiencies have reached 253 % and 219 %  respectively  These types of solar cells show good performance as well as high stability and dominate the current photovoltaic market  However  they are rigid  bulky  and require a lot of energy in production  especially in the process of high-purity silicon wafers  The second-generation solar cells are based on amorphous silicon ( a-Si )  cadmium tellurium ( CdTe )  and copper indium gallium selenide ( CIGS )  whose efficiencies have reached 140 %  221 %  and 226 %  respectively [ 1 ]  However  the energy consumption of second-generation solar cells is still large due to the use of vacuum processes and high-temperature treatments  Furthermore  the scarce and toxic elements used in the cells are another adverse factor against mass production  The third-generation solar cells are based on nanomaterials or organic materials  They are solutions that are processable  cost- and energy-effective  suitable for flexible substrates  and can be easily integrated  These cells include organic solar cells  dye-sensitized solar cells  quantum dot solar cells  and perovskite solar cells ( PSCs )  The newly developing photovoltaics are based on perovskites  The cells are quite efficient ; however  there are some major concerns for practical applications including expensive counter electrode materials  In this chapter  the emerging counter electrode materials for PSCs will be discussed  712 Perovskite Solar Cells Perovskite material has a structural formula of ABX3  where the A can be an organic ion such as methylammonium ( CH3NH3+  MA+ )  formamidinium ( CH3 ( NH2 ) 2+  FA+ )  or an inorganic cation such as cesium ; B is a divalent metal cation ( eg  Pb2+  Sn2+  Ge2+ ) ; and X is a halide anion ( eg  Cl−  Br−  I− )  Perovskite was used in 2009 by Kojima et al  [ 2 ] as a light absorber in dye-sensitized solar cells for the first time with power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 38 %  In 2012  Kim et al  [ 3 ] developed all-solid-state solar cells by replacing the liquid electrolyte with N2  N2  N2′  N2′  N7  N7  N7′  N7′-octakis ( 4-methoxyphenyl ) -99′-spirobi [ 9H-fluorene ] -22′77′-tetramine ( spiro-OMeTAD ) as hole transport material with an impressive PCE of 97 %  The perovskite used has a composition of methylammonium lead halide ( CH3NH3PbI3 ) and its crystal structure is shown in Fig  71a  The thin layer of this material on the mesoporous titania ( TiO2 ) surface is shown in Fig  71b  The cell has a mesoscopic configuration with only several micrometers to 06 μm thick as shown in Fig  71c  Further study by Heo et al  [ 4 ] for a mesoscopic PSC with a configuration of fluorine-doped tin oxide/compact titanium dioxide/mesoporous titanium dioxide ( methylammonium lead iodide ) /poly ( triarylamine ) /gold [ FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 ( CH3NH3PbI3 ) /PTAA/Au ] pushed the efficiency up to 120 %  The seminal work by Lee et al  in 2012 revealed the ambipolar nature of perovskite [ 5 ]  They reported the PCE of 109 % in an all-solid-state device with a configuration of fluorine-doped tin oxide/compact TiO2/mesoporous Al2O3 ( methylammonium lead iodide ) /poly ( triarylamine ) /spiro-OMeTAD/gold [ FTO/c-TiO2/m-Al2O3 ( CH3NH3PbI3 ( Cl ) ) /spiro-OMeTAD/Au ]  The findings indicated that both electrons and holes can transport within the perovskite film with a long charge diffusion length [ 6  7 ]  In 2013  Liu et al  [ 8 ] reported a planar device structure with a configuration of FTO/c-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 ( Cl ) ) /spiro-OMeTAD/Au  The device produced a PCE over 15 %  Excellent ambipolar nature of perovskite enables efficient charge transfer process  Hole transport material free PSCs with Au [ 9  10 ] or carbon [ 11 ] as a counter electrode were also developed  which highlighted the excellent charge transport properties of perovskite  Various perovskite deposition methods including one [ 3  5 ] or two [ 12 ] step solution process  low-temperature vapor-assisted solution process [ 13 ]  and vacuum-evaporation deposition [ 8 ] were also developed  In 2014  Jeon et al  [ 14 ] reported a certified PCE of 162 % for a CH3NH3PbI3 ( MAPbI3 ) based normal structure ( n-i-p ) mesoscopic device  In 2017  the same group pushed the efficiency of PSCs up to 221 % by careful control of the perovskite film quality  Fig  71 figure 1 ( a )

silicon solar cells ; however  this novel PV technology still faces challenges towards commercialization [ 15  16 ]  Firstly  it is still quite challenging to fabricate PSCs with long lifetimes ( > 25 years ) for out-door application [ 1718192021222324252627 ]  The CH3NH3PbI3  a key component of the PSC  degrades into lead iodide ( PbI2 ) and methylammonium Iodide ( CH3NH3I ) due to the moisture  which significantly affects the stability of PSCs [ 2829303132 ]  Meanwhile  the existence of oxygen also affects the stability of CH3NH3PbI3 [ 33  34  35363738 ]  Recently  it was found that CH3NH3PbI3 also degrades under continuous light illumination [ 39 ]  especially when the ultraviolet ( UV ) light are not filtered [ 40 ]  Secondly  the hysteresis is problematic  Hysteresis phenomena observed in current density-voltage measurements  where the measured PCE highly depends on scan rate/direction and preconditions [ 41 ]  The origin of hysteretic effects is still unclear [ 42  43 ]  ferroelectric polarization of perovskites [ 44  45 ]  ion migration within perovskites [ 46474849505152 ]  charge trapping and de-trapping of charge carriers [ 57  58 ]  capacitive effects [ 53  54 ] could be the cause of this phenomena  Several strategies including immobilizing ion transport and/or reducing interfacial traps [ 55  56 ]  surface passivation of perovskite films [ 57  58 ]  and interface modification of charge transport layers [ 57 ] have been investigated to alleviate hysteresis  Thirdly  the use of lead ( Pb ) is of great concern  The lead is quite toxic to the environment [ 58 ]  Even though strict encapsulation can decrease the risk of releasing toxic compounds into the environment [ 59 ]  it is desirable to develop lead-free PSCs [ 58  60  61 ]  Fourthly  upscaling is quite challenging  The current champion cells are made in a very small cell ( ~ 009 cm2 )  For practical applications  it is imperative to develop technology for large scale  energy-efficient  high-throughput  low-cost manufacturing commercialized perovskite photovoltaics ( PV ) using doctors blade [ 626364656667686970717273747576 ]  inkjet printing [ 77787980 ]  slot-die printing [ 8182838485 ]  screen printing [ 11 ]  spray coating [ 75  86878889909192939495 ]  roll to roll [ 81  96979899 ]  etc  Lastly  the most used noble metal counter electrode materials and their deposition cost take up a large part of the cost of PSCs  The use of the noble metal counter electrode in large scale PSCs will largely increase the cost  The noble metal thin-film electrodes also suffer from long-term stability concern  In addition  metal thin-film electrodes usually require high vacuum thermal evaporation system  which is highly energy consuming and complicated  thereby limiting its mass production for large-scale PSCs  Therefore  it is urgent to develop low-cost and stable counter electrode materials  such as metal nanostructured materials  carbon materials electrode  and conductive polymer electrode  etc  to replace expensive noble metal thin-film electrode  714 Counter Electrode for Perovskite Solar Cells Although the PSCs are evolved from dye-sensitized solar cells  the catalytic activity for electrolyte regeneration is no longer required for counter electrode materials  Ideally  a counter electrode in PSCs should possess high conductivity  good mechanical properties  robust physical and chemical stability  easy deposition  low cost  and eco-friendly qualities  Besides the high efficiency  PSCs are also appealing for the constructing of tandem solar cells to overcome the Shockley-Queisser limit of single junction solar cells  In addition  PSCs are promising for building integrated photovoltaics  especially if made semitransparent and used as solar windows  For tandem or transparent solar cells  incident light is required to penetrate through the counter electrode before reaching the absorber in transparent solar cells or tandem solar cells  a good optical transmittance is also a critical property for counter electrode  715 Metal Electrodes In PSC  metal electrodes are the most common materials for counter electrode due to their high conductivity  good reflectivity  and also easy integration process  Although different metals have different work function  it has been demonstrated that the device performance of PSCs is mainly determined by an intrinsic quasi-Fermi level splitting of perovskite and the interaction with electron and hole transport materials  The work function of the bottom and top conductive electrode may be not that much essential [ 62 ]  This is due to the fact that perovskite exhibits low exciton binding energy and superior carrier conductivity  the anode-cathode work function difference appears not that important for the separation and collection of photogenerated carriers [ 62 ]  Thus  different metals can be employed as counter electrode materials in PSCs  716 Metal Thin-Film Electrodes Metal thin film is usually deposited through vacuum thermal evaporation  in which metal source is heated at high temperature to form evaporated metal vapor in a vacuum with a typical pressure of 10−4~10−5 Pa and the vapor travel directly to the target substrate ( PSCs without electrode ) and condense to a solid thin film using a shadow mask to pattern the electrodes  Sometimes  the metal thin-film electrode can be also etched via simple scrape or laser etching to form the desired pattern such as interconnections for modules  However  noble metal thin-film electrode is not an ideal counter electrode for commercialization of PSCs due to the high cost of the high purity metal source  high vacuum requirement during electrode deposition  and also the low production efficiency of electrode disposition  Besides  the reaction of the metal thin films with the ambient environment and also the bottom active layers raise a long-term stability concern regarding the metal thin-film electrode for commercialization of PSCs  Gold ( Au ) is one of the most common counter electrode materials in PSCs because of its resistance to corrosion  electrical conductivity ( 45 × 107 S/m )  excellent ductility  and lack of toxicity  To date  most of the high efficiency normal structured PSCs were equipped with vacuum evaporated gold thin-film ( 80~100 nm ) as a counter electrode to collect charge carriers  including the PSCs with record PCEs of 221 % [ 100 ]  Gold electrodes also have some drawbacks  It has been demonstrated that the diffusion of Au across the hole transport layer after storage can lead to degradation of device performance  which will be discussed in the following part  In addition  Au is an expensive metal ( Price is 3978 US dollar/g from London Gold Fix  2017  July ) that closely related with global economics  which hampers its large-scale applications as an electrode in solar cells  Alternatively  silver ( Ag ) has also been used as a counter electrode in both normal [ 101  102 ] and inverted [ 103104105 ] structured high-efficiency PSCs  The electrical conductivity of silver is the greatest of all metals ( 62 × 107 S/m )  The price of Ag is 052 dollar/g from London Gold Fix ( 2017  July ) much cheaper than that of Au  However  Ag is very active in the existence of halide  resulting in corrosion or contamination of the Ag electrode  It has been reported that the Ag electrode-based PSCs degrade after being kept under humidity air  Aluminum ( Al ) is the most widely used nonferrous metal in human activity ; its production exceeded that of any other metal except iron  Al is much cheaper than Ag  but it exhibits high conductivity ( 35 × 107 S/m )  In inverted structured PSCs  Al is commonly employed as a top electrode [ 106  107 ]  In particular  Shao et al  [ 108 ] reported high efficiency of 194 % for inverted structured planar PSCs with Al counter electrode  However  Al has been reported to be associated with issues such as air-exposure-induced oxidation and interdiffusion of Al atoms into the organic layer  which hampers its application in PSCs [ 109 ]  Copper ( Cu ) is used mostly as a pure metal  which has been widely used in electrical wire  roofing and plumbing  and industrial machinery  Cu is also a cheap metal  but it exhibits comparable conductivity ( 596 × 107 S/m ) to Al  However  Cu has been rarely used as the top electrode in PSCs  When Cu was first used as a top electrode in flexible inverted structured planar PSCs with additional chromium ( III ) oxide/chromium ( Cr2O3/Cr ) interlayer  increased device stability under ambient conditions was observed [ 110 ]  Huang ’ s group first demonstrated the employment of pure Cu thin film as a top electrode in inverted structured planar PSCs and highlight the good stability of Cu electrode [ 62  111  112 ]  They used vacuum thermal evaporated Cu  Al  and Au as counter electrode in planar inverted PSCs with doctor-blade coated mixed cation perovskite ( FAxMA1−xPbI3 )  and methylammonium lead iodide ( MAPbI3 ) as light absorber and the devices with Cu cathode gave champion PCE of 183 % ( FAxMA1−xPbI3 )  which is higher than that of Al and Au due to less reaction of perovskite with Cu than Al [ 62 ]  Recently  the same group reported a certified PCE of 2059 % for Cu electrode-based inverted structured planar PSCs via defects passivation [ 112 ]  This group also demonstrated the employment of commercial conductive Cu tape as a counter electrode of planar inverted PSCs  obtaining PCE of 127 % and good stability  The Cu tape was transferred on the charge transport layer via a vacuum-free low-temperature lamination technique  which significantly reduces the cost of device fabrication [ 113 ]  Their work suggested that Cu may be a better choice for the counter electrode material in PSCs than other widely used electrode materials  and also Cu ink or pate might be potential for scalable manufacturing of PSCs [ 111 ]  Chromium ( Cr ) is usually used in the form of metal alloys in the chemical  refractory  and foundry industries  Pure Cr exhibits relatively high conductivity ( 79 × 106 S/m )  So far  Cr has been rarely used as the top electrode in PSCs  When used in PSCs  Cr2O3 were observed at the charge transport layer/Cr interface  which can act as a protective layer and improve the long term stability [ 110  114 ]  Nickel ( Ni ) has a work function of ∼504 eV  very close to that of gold ( ∼51 eV )  but with a unit price less than 003 % of that of gold  A sputtering-coated nickel film was first used as the counter electrode in a normal-structured mesoscopic PSCs and obtained PCE of 104 % [ 115 ]  Later  a sputter deposited nickel oxide/nickel [ NiOx/Ni ] double layer was also reported as a hole transport material ( HTM ) /contact couple in normal architecture of PSC with PCE of 728 % [ 116 ]  Without using vacuum thermal or electron-beam evaporation  Ku et al  [ 117 ] used a printable mesoporous nickel film as the counter electrode in printable PSCs  giving a PCE of 136 %  Their printable Ni electrode has a thickness of 2 μm with favorable conductivity  which can offer robust protection of underlayer to improve the device ’ s long-term stability  This low-cost  printable Ni electrode is promising for low-cost  fully-printable solar cells with high efficiency and long service life  Moreover  they demonstrated a reuse process of the mesoporous Ni electrode-based PSCs by washing and reloading perovskite for fresh devices and obtained an efficiency of 121 % for reused devices  The reusable mesoporous metal-cathode based PSC provides a promising approach towards low-cost PSC with a long service life [ 117 ]  Molybdenum ( Mo ) is also one of the metals possessing a high work function and also high electrical conductivity  enabling this metal to be a candidate material for low-cost and highly efficient PSCs  In addition  Mo is chemically more stable against reactions with halides and oxidation in the air compared to Ag and Al  respectively  Jeong et al  [ 118 ] first employed a thermal evaporated Mo as a counter electrode of PSCs  By optimizing the thickness of Mo electrode and combination with high-quality perovskite layer  their PSCs exhibited the best PCE of 1506 % with small hysteresis  Moreover  the Mo electrode was demonstrated to have superior resistance and restoration capability against external scratch or deformation compared to the Au electrode  Super thin-film metal electrodes with a thickness of several nanometers can be also used as a counter electrode  especially in semitransparent PSCs  Such devices are promising for application in building integrated photovoltaics such as solar window due to their decent efficiency and good transparency  However  because of the trade-off of the conductivity and transparency of the semitransparent electrode  it is important to optimize the electrode to achieve both high conductivity and high transparency  Eperon et al  [ 119 ] used a thin ( ∼10 nm ) layer of gold as the counter electrode in semi-transparent PSCs featuring configuration of FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3–xClx/spiro-OMeTAD/Au  as shown in Fig  72  The devices are reasonably transparent ; however  the gold electrode is a major source of transmittance loss  Their devices with PCE about 8 % showed average visible transmittance ( AVT ) of 7 %  Such low PCE and AVT is attributed to the large electrode resistance and low transparency  respectively  Thus  more transparent electrodes as well as with high conductivity are necessary  specifically the counter electrode  for fully optimized semitransparent PSCs [ 119 ]  A semitransparent PSCs based on Au thin ( ∼40 nm ) layer and perovskite grid also demonstrate 20–70 % transparency with a PCE of 5 % at 20 % transparency [ 120 ]  A pure Ag thin ( ∼20 nm ) layer was also used as transparency electrode for PSCs featuring configuration of indium tin oxide/copper ( I ) thiocyanate/methylammonium lead iodide/ [ 66 ] -phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester/silver [ ITO/CuSCN/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/Ag ]  realizing a PCE of 10 % and AVT of 25 % [ 121 ]  A thinner Ag ( ∼10 nm ) layer was also used as transparency electrode for PSCs featuring configuration of indium tin oxide/ ( poly ( 34-ethylenedioxythiophene ) polystyrene sulfonate ) /methylammonium lead iodide/ [ 66 ] -Phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester/fullerene/11-amino-1-undecanethiol hydrochloride/silver [ ITO/PEDOT : PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PC71BM/C60/AUH/Ag ]  realizing a PCE of 82 % and AVT of 34 % [ 122 ]  Besides the top transparent electrode  a super thin metal electrode can be also acting as series connection transparent layer in a tandem solar cell  Liu et al  [ 123 ] demonstrated a series connection of a ∼ 90 nm thick perovskite front sub-cell and a ∼ 100 nm thick polymer : fullerene blend back sub-cell that benefits from an efficient graded recombination layer containing a zwitterionic fullerene  Ag  and molybdenum trioxide ( MoO3 )  The resultant tandem perovskite/polymer solar cell gave a PCE of 160 %  with low hysteresis  Fig  72 figure 2 Diagram showing the architecture of the semitransparent PSC  ( b ) tilted cross-sectional SEM image of a full semitransparent solar cell  ( c ) Average current density-voltage ( J–V ) characteristics for the cells  and ( d ) power conversion efficiency

be enhanced by applying a protective layer due to the anti-reflective and optical interference  Roldán-Carmona et al  [ 124 ] used super thin Au layer as a transparent counter electrode in a PSCs featuring configuration of fluorine-doped tin oxide/ ( poly ( 34-ethylenedioxythiophene ) polystyrene sulfonate ) /methylammonium lead iodide/ [ 66 ] -Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester/gold/lithium fluoride [ FTO/PEDOT : PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/Au/LiF ] as shown in Fig  73a  They reduced the thickness of Au layer to 6 nm  and another LiF capping layer with a thickness of 100 nm was used to protect the Au layer and reduce the energy lost by the specular reflection of the device while enabling more transparency and keeping a high short-circuit current density ( Jsc )  As shown in Fig  73b  their semitransparent PSCs with PCE of 64 % showed an AVT of 30 %  An electrode consists of a thin Ag top layer ( 10 nm ) capped with MoO3 ( 20 nm ) layer was also used as a top electrode in inverted PSCs ; the resultant device showed PCEs of 110 and 87 % for the front and back incidence  respectively [ 125 ]  Fig  73 figure 3 ( a ) Diagram showing the architecture of the semitransparent PSC and chemical structures of the organic hole and electron transport materials  ( b ) Photograph of the semitransparent PSC with an AVT ∼ 30 % and a PCE of 64 %  ( Reproduced with permission from Ref  [ 124 ]  Copyright ( 2014 )  Royal Society of Chemistry ) Full size image Different from the above transparent electrode with single super thin-film metal layer  a dielectric–metal–dielectric ( DMD ) multilayer relying on interference effects provided by the two dielectric layers  exhibits good light transmission and also decent conductivity [ 126 ]  DMD electrode has been widely adopted as visible-transparent and infrared ( IR ) -reflective coatings [ 126  127 ]  and as transparent electrode for various optoelectronic devices  including organic solar cells [ 128129130131 ]  organic light emitting diodes [ 132133134135 ]  and transparent field effect transistors [ 136 ]  A critical factor to their success as semi-transparent windows is the precise selection and thickness optimization of the individual dielectric and metal films  where the metal layer stacking in-between the dielectric materials determines the trade-off between the transparency and the conductivity of the entire top electrode [ 137 ]  Gaspera et al  [ 137 ] first employed DMD transparent electrode composed of a MoO3–Au ( 10 nm ) –MoO3 stack in PSCs as shown in Fig  74  where MoO3 enable efficient hole injection properties and a good nucleation surface for Au deposition ( Fig  74e and f ) ; Au provide good conductivity and stability towards air oxidation  By combining gas-quenching deposited thin CH3NH3PbI3 layer  their device with PCEs between 55 % and 136 % delivered AVT values of 31 % and 7 %  respectively  Fig  74 figure 4 ( a ) Schematic illustration ( not to scale ) of the PSC  ( b

excellent thermal-mirror functionality for a semi-transparent PSCs [ 138 ]  By selectively maximizing electrode transmission at visible and reflectance at NIR region  heat-blocking and “ cool-to-touch ” operation with near-infrared surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy ( near infra-red surface enhanced resonance  NIR-SER ) as high as 855 % was demonstrated with no sacrifice in average visible-light transmittance and luminous transmittance using an electrode structure that incorporates a thick Ag layer in conjunction with ZnS as a high-index capping layer  They demonstrated efficient semitransparent solar cells with ideal heat management capability  which can greatly enhance the viability in various practical applications of PSCs  An efficient DMD electrode of polyethylenimine ( PEIE ) silver/ Molybdenum n-oxide [ PEIE/Ag/MoOx ] was also developed for planar inverted PSCs [ 139 ]  The high transparency of the DMD electrode also enables the tandem solar cells  Yang et al  [ 140 ] constructed a four terminal tandem solar cell employing solution processed CIGS and PSCs integrated with a DMD top electrode  For the DMD electrode  they introduced an ultrathin gold seed layer ( ∼1 nm ) beneath a silver film to improve the adhesion  It was found that the seed layer induced continuous film formation [ 141 ]  As shown in Fig  75a–c  the silver film without a gold seed layer is not continuous at 11 nm  presenting isolated metal islands  and the film is highly resistive  With the same metal film thickness  the silver film with 1 nm gold seed layer becomes continuous across the entire film as shown in Fig  75b  As a result  the conductivity of the corresponding silver film improves several orders of magnitude from 20 KΩ sq−1 ( 11 nm Ag ) to around 16 Ω sq−1 ( 1 nm Au + 10 nm Ag )  In terms of conductivity and transparency  the gold-seeded silver film ( 1 nm Au + 10 nm Ag ) shown in Fig  75f is also superior to pure gold film  where the same thickness of gold is very resistive and exhibits low transmittance in the visible region due to the strong plasmonic scattering effect of the gold nano-domains  With improved conductivity and transparency  their semitransparent PSCs illuminated from DMD top electrode gave a PCE of 115 %  and the resultant tandem cell gave a PCE of 155 % ( Fig  75h ) [ 140 ]  Device modeling has shown that the optical spectrum matching of the top sub-cell and bottom sub-cell is critical to realize high-efficiency tandem solar cell  The excellent bandgap tunability of perovskites provides a platform for optimizing both wide bandgap top sub-cell ( 17–19 eV ) or low bandgap bottom sub-cell ( 09–12 eV ) [ 142  143 ]  Zhao et al  [ 144 ] demonstrated an efficient low-bandgap ( ∼125 eV ) with the composition of ( FASnI3 ) 06 ( MAPbI3 ) 04 and achieved a maximum PCE of 176 % and a certified efficiency of 1701 % by optimizing perovskite thin-film thickness and film quality  When mechanically stacked with a 158 eV  bandgap perovskite top cell featuring a configuration of glass/FTO/ ( SnO2/C60-SAM/FA03MA07PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/MoOx ( 10 nm ) /Au ( 85 nm ) /MoOx ( 10 nm )  their all-perovskite four-terminal tandem cell delivered a steady-state efficiency of 21 %  These results highlight that DMD electrode is promising for the transparent counter electrode in PSC-based tandem solar cells  Fig  75 figure 5 The film

containing an average of eight epoxy units per polymeric unit SU-8/MoO3/Au structure was developed for inverted planar PSCs with vapor-deposited perovskite film  giving PCE of 905 % [ 145 ]  The PCE maintained 74 % of the initial value after 2000 bending cycles with a bending radius of 35 mm  An ITO-free semitransparent inverted PSC with a super thin Au film as a bottom electrode and DMD multilayer with structure of MoO3 ( 3 nm ) /Au ( 1 nm ) /Ag ( 7 nm ) /MoO3 ( 5 nm ) /tris-8-hydroxyquinoline aluminum ( Alq3 ) ( 50 nm ) as the top electrode was also reported [ 146 ]  The PSC achieved a PCE of 867 % with AVT of 1594 %  Moreover  the flexible device maintains 88 % of its initial PCE after 1000 bending cycles with a bending radius of 39 mm  The authors further introduced another MoO3 layer between Norland Optical Adhesive 63 ( NOA63 ) and Au [ 147 ]  The resultant PSC achieved a PCE of 696 % with AVT of 1816 %  Moreover  the flexible device maintains 71 % of its initial PCE after 1000 bending cycles with a bending radius of 4 mm  PSCs with metal thin-film counter electrode still suffer from issues  In PSCs  a metal thin film was deposited on the top of the device  the stability issues related to the counter electrode may rely on the contact interface between the metal contact electrode and charge transporting layer under the ambient condition  Zafer et al  [ 148 ] observed the presence of pinholes in a spiro-OMeTAD layer with an average diameter of ∼135 nm and a density of ∼372 holes/μm2 by atomic force microscopy and large pinholes with diameters in the range of 1–20 μm and a density of ∼289 holes/mm2 by optical microscopy and Fourier transform infrared microscopy  Such pinholes increase the possibility of contact between perovskite and metal electrode  These pinholes provide a quick migration pathway for the outward diffusion of the halide compounds towards metal electrode and facilitate the potential inward migration of metal to the perovskite layer  It has been observed that PSCs operating devices employing a spiro-OMeTAD and Au electrode at temperatures exceeding 70 °C causes irreversible performance loss [ 149 ]  This is speculated to be due to the migration of Au across the spiro-OMeTAD into the perovskite layer  which has been confirmed by time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy elemental depth profiling and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry [ 149 ]  The formation of gold precipitates at the interface between spiro-OMeTAD and perovskite and of bigger clusters within the perovskite active layer and the mesoporous TiO2 layer was also observed that further suggest the migration of Au [ 150 ]  Au diffusing inside the perovskite can produce shunts across the device and create deep trap states causing nonradiative recombination and consequentially results in device performance deterioration  Continuous light illumination was also observed to cause photo-induced degradation of PSCs  correlated with the chemical contact breaking and inefficient charge collection at hole transport material/Au electrode interface [ 151 ]  Different from the instability of perovskite under humidity condition  even strict encapsulation can not avoid the migration of Au and the degradation at hole transport material/Au electrode interface under light illumination  Ag is much more active than Au  which makes Ag easily react with halide compound resulting degradation  However  Ag can become corroded when it is in contact with the perovskite or the halide compounds origin from perovskite degradation [ 40  152  153 ]  Kato et al  [ 109 ] proposed as a mechanism that the CH3NH3PbI3 layer first decomposes into mobile methylammonium iodide ( CH3NH3I ) and hydrogen iodide ( HI )  which is accelerated with the presence of water or oxygen in ambient conditions  These iodide compounds then migrate through spiro-OMeTAD layer towards Ag electrode  aided by pinholes  For Al electrode  air-exposure can induce fast oxidation of the electrode and the interdiffusion of Al atoms into the organic layer  Thus  Al is considered as an unstable electrode for PSCs  Furthermore  it is reported that Al can rapidly reduce Pb2+ to Pb0  converting CH3NH3PbI3 first to ( CH3NH3 ) 4PbI6·2H2O and then to CH3NH3I [ 154 ]  An interlayer has been introduced into PSCs to block the interaction of electrode and bottom vivacious chemical source  In general  oxide and organic materials are the most common interlayer materials used in PSCs  For example  the employment of titanium-niobium n-oxide ( TiNbOx ) as an interlayer beneath Ag can significantly enhance device stability by inhibiting Ag migration into the bottom layer and penetration of humidity [ 104 ]  An efficient zinc oxide ( ZnO ) electron transport layer also exhibited the outstanding capability of inhibiting Al migration superior to PCBM  the resultant devices showed good stability [ 155 ]  Sanehira et al  [ 156 ] found that devices with MoOx/Al electrodes are more stable than devices with more conventional  and more costly  Au and Ag electrodes  when they investigated the stability of unencapsulated PSCs with Au  Ag  MoOx/Au  MoOx/Ag  and MoOx/Al electrode under constant illumination and constant load conditions  Other kinds of interlayers have also been reported  For example  stable Cr metal interlayer was deposited between the hole transport layer ( HTL ) and a gold electrode to reduce high-temperature-induced irreversible long-term losses [ 149 ]  In addition  graphene was also demonstrated to be a useful buffer layer that blocks the diffusion of air and Au into the perovskite layer [ 157 ]  A thiol-functionalized cationic surfactant ( 11-mercapto undecyl ) trimethylammonium bromide ( MUTAB ) has also been used as interlayer to exert multi-positive effects for the enhancement of Ag stability  including decrease of contact resistance between the active layer and Ag electrode  improvement of ambient and thermal stability  and reduction of the percolation threshold of ultrathin Ag film [ 158 ]  Apart from the penetration of the metal across charge transport layer towards perovskite  the mobile iodide compound come from the perovskite may also diffuse outward to corrode the metal contact  Kwanghee Lee et al  [ 159 ] introduced an amine-mediated titanium suboxide as a chemical inhibition layer between the PCBM and Ag contact electrode to inhibit the corrosion of Ag by halide compounds ( Fig  76 )  The relevant PSCs maintained almost 80 % of their initial PCEs after 1 year ( 9000 h ) storage in nitrogen and 80 % of the initial PCEs after 200 h in ambient conditions without any encapsulation  Fig  76 figure 6 Schematic diagram and J–V characteristics with fast degradation

devices with a CIL buffer layer and the counter electrode protection process with J–V characteristics and absorption spectra ( inset )  ( Reproduced with permission from Ref  [ 159 ]  Copyright ( 2016 )  Royal Society of Chemistry ) Full size image Another promising strategy to solve the issues regarding the noble metal electrode is to replace them with other low cost and stable metal electrode materials  such as Cu [ 62  111  112 ]  Cr [ 114 ]  Mo [ 118 ]  Ni [ 115  117 ]  or carbon [ 11  160 ]  etc  Taking Cu  for example  Huang et al  [ 111 ] have reported that Cu is stable even in direct contact with MAPbI3 in the encapsulated device  and it is predicted to be stable for almost 170 years at room temperatures and 22 years under operation at 40 °C  Their devices with a Cu electrode exhibited a PCE above 20 % and retained 98 % of the initial efficiency after 816 h storage in an ambient environment without encapsulation  Mo is also chemically more stable against reaction with halides  ambient condition  and also superior mechanical and scratch-resistance properties  which enable this material to be a promising candidate for a stable counter electrode for PSCs [ 118 ]  In addition  the metal alloy is also a promising candidate for a noble metal electrode  For example  silver aluminum ( AgAl ) alloy electrode has been demonstrated to be more stable than Ag and Al  which is due to the formation of alumina n-oxide ( AlOx )  acting as an interlayer layer to inhibit not only the diffusion of Ag atoms into bottom layer but also the penetration of moisture encroachment [ 161  162 ]  Fabrication of metal thin-film electrode is challenging  The expensive raw electrode materials and the complicate vacuum deposition system for metal thin-film electrode largely increase the cost of manufacturing PSCs  They are not applicable for large-scale production due to the limitation of vacuum thermal evaporation  The high vacuum thermal evaporation process is also highly energy consuming and complicated  thereby limiting its mass production  Therefore  it is desirable to exploit substitution of these metal electrodes to improve stability  simplify the cost of device fabrication  and recognize large-scale fabrication for scalable PSCs ( cf  Table 71 )  Table 71 Summary of the device performance of perovskite solar cells with a super thin-metal electrode Full size table 717 Metal Nano-Structured Electrode Metal nanostructures in the form of nanogrids  nanowires  or continuous nanofibers as efficient transparent and conductive electrodes are promising candidates of counter electrode materials in PSCs due to their low-cost  high conductivity  easy deposition  solution processability  excellent transparency  and flexibility  In general  these metal nanostructures possess larger thickness than that of the metal thin film  which makes their conductivity is close to the metal thin film  Moreover  the metal nanostructures can form conductive networks that enable high conductivity  In addition  the interspace of the metal nanostructures can provide excellent light transmittance  which makes metal nanostructures to be a promising candidate as an efficient transparent conductive electrode in semitransparent PSCs  Besides  metal nanostructures such as nanowires can be easily dispersed in a solvent or mixed with the polymer to form a paste  which makes it possible to deposit these materials via simple processing methods  such as spin coating  spray coating  screen printing or roll to roll printing  etc  Metal nanowires ( NWs ) are one-dimension metallic nanomaterials  with widths of a few tens of nanometers and lengths on the micrometer scale  which are widely used as a conductive electrode  A variety of metal including Ag  Cu  Au  and Ni have been explored with quite diverse photovoltaic performance in the PSC as summarized in Table 72 [ 163164165166167 ]  NWs usually are solution processable and can be deposited via different processing methods  such as spin coating  doctor blading  spray coating  and lamination  which allows easy translating from lab-scale to industrial-scale fabrication [ 168 ]  In general  metal NWs electrodes exhibit high conductivity  excellent transparency  and robust flexibility  making them a promising candidate to replace not only metal thin-film electrode for the top counter electrode but also the traditional indium tin oxide bottom electrode as the next-generation transparent and flexible electrode [ 168 ]  Guo et al  [ 169 ] used silver nanowires ( AgNWs ) as top electrodes in inverted structured planar PSCs featuring configuration of ITO/PEDOT : PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PCBM/ZnO/AgNWs by spraying isopropanol diluted AgNWs on the top of PCBM/ZnO layer  where zinc oxide nanoparticles is introduced between the AgNWs and PCBM to ensure Ohmic contact and protect underlying perovskite as shown in Fig  77  As a result  their device gave a fill factor ( FF ) of 668 %  open circuit voltage ( Voc ) = 0964 V  Jsc = 1318 mA cm−2  and PCE of 849 % with a transmittance of 284 %  The high transmittance is attributed to the excellent transmittance of the AgNWs and also the inverted structure of the device without using transmittance regressive charge transport materials  The device performance can also be improved by the introduction of a robust ZnO layer [ 158  170 ]  Interestingly  when the AgNWs counter electrode-based PSCs were combined with dielectric mirrors to tailor the device appearance to almost any desired color and simultaneously offers additional light harvesting for the solar cell  a PCE of 42 % and an AVT of 31 % were demonstrated for cells showing a colored aesthetic appeal [ 171 ]  Copper nanowires ( CuNWs ) has also been reported as a top electrode in PSCs  yielding a PCE of 988 % with much better stability [ 172 ]  Table 72 Summary of the device performance of perovskite solar cells with the metal nano-structured electrode Full size

Society of Chemistry ) Full size image One unique property of metal NWs as an electrode is their ability to make flexible PSCs  Compared to commonly used indium tin oxide ( ITO ) or fluorine-doped tin oxide ( FTO ) glass  the metal nanowires exhibited excellent flexibility  Lee et al  [ 173 ] recently reported a flexible normal structured PSC using Ti substrate as a bottom conductive electrode and spray-coated AgNWs as a top conductive electrode  As the Ti substrate is opaque  in their devices  the incident light is penetrated into the device through the AgNWs electrode  By carefully control of the AgNWs deposition  their device showed a PCE of 745 %  with Voc of 0918 V  Jsc of 1648 mA cm−2  and FF of 49 %  The PCE of the device remained 974 % of the initial value after 100 bending cycles with a bending radius of 10 mm  which supports the high potential of AgNWs as materials for top electrodes in flexible perovskite devices  Metal NWs also shows application potential in fiber-like PSCs  For example  Li et al  [ 174 ] reported a fiber-like PSCs featuring configuration of CNT/ [ mesoporous titania ] m-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3–xCl3/P3HT-SWNT [ poly ( 3-hexylthiophene-25-diyl ) -modified single-walled nanotubes ] /AgNWs from the inner core to the outer surface  The best PCE of 303 % was obtained for the twisted PSCs with Voc of 0615 V  Jsc of 875 mA cm−2  FF of 564 %  and the PCE remained 89 % of initial value after a 1000 cycles bending test after in ambient conditions  Nanogrids have also been used for PSCs [ 175 ]  It was found that nanogrid can be easily controlled by varying the grid width  spacing  and thickness  which are beneficial to the manufacturer [ 167  175 ]  These grids can be used as a conductive electrode as both bottom [ 176 ] and top [ 177178179180 ] conductive electrode  For example  a Ni grid/conductive polymer combined electrode as shown in Fig  78 was used as a top conductive electrode for semitransparent PSCs via lamination fabrication method [ 177 ]  In this combined electrode  a metal grid embedded in a polymer film provides x–y conduction with large area lateral conductivity of ca 12 Ω sq−1 and the organic conductor  ie  PEDOT : PSS  provides z conduction to the grid  An average PCE of 133 % was obtained for the transparent PSCs with Voc of 095 V  Jsc of 207 mA cm−2  and FF of 636 % when illuminated from FTO side  and an average PCE of 98 % was obtained with Voc of 093 V  Jsc of 139 mA cm−2  and FF of 677 % when illuminated from metal grids side  These results suggest that metal grids electrode is a promising alternative of electrode materials for PSCs  Fig  78 figure 8 ( a ) SEM micrograph of transparent conducting adhesive applied to an embedded Ni grid on PET substrate ( top ) and a photo of the TCA-Laminate transparent counter electrode incorporating the metal mesh ( bottom )  ( b ) Schematic of PSC with Ni mesh counter electrode  ( Reproduced with permission from Ref  [ 177 ]  Copyright ( 2014 )  Wiley ) Full size image It should be mentioned that metal nanoparticles could also be an option for acting as a metal electrode for PSC due to their compatibility with high conductivity and low-temperature processing technique as observed in numerous printed electronics [ 181 ]  Schmidt et al  [ 81 ] first employed screen printed Ag electrode in a fully printable PSCs  However  a given ink can adversely affect underlying layers and if the ink contains incompatible solvent  Thus  it is challenging to find a suitable ink system for stable perovskite  Metal nanostructures-based electrodes also suffer from several drawbacks  which block their practical application in PSCs  One drawback of metal nanostructures is poor stability due to degradation  AgNWs was found to be covered with nodules  which were iodine-containing compound further confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ( EDX ) data when directly deposited on the top of the perovskite/HTM active layer as a top electrode in PSCs as shown in Fig  79 [ 182 ]  The degradation mechanism is same as above described decomposition of Ag thin film  in which the mobile halide source  such as CH3NH3I and HI from decomposed perovskite  migrate through the pinhole of the HTM layer and encounter Ag electrode results in the formation of silver iodide ( AgI ) [ 109 ]  To improve the stability  an interlayer  such as oxide [ 169 ] and inert metal [ 182 ]  were usually introduced between the HTM and AgNWs electrode acting as a protective layer to block the interaction of electrode and bottom vivacious chemical source  Another drawback is the strong polar solvent in the metal nanostructures dispersion ink  which may dissolve the bottom active layer and consequentially destroy the device  Besides  a thermal treatment of deposited nanostructured metal electrodes can significantly enhance their conductivity  However  the active layer  especially the perovskite layer  is sensitive to high temperature  A high-temperature treatment may lead to decomposition of perovskite  Given this problem  a pre-high temperature treatment and a followed transfer method is an effective strategy to resolve this issue  In addition  a plasmonic welding method is also a potential strategy [ 183 ]  Fig  79 figure 9 ( a ) TEM image ( b ) schematic illustration of the degrading mechanism of Ag and elemental mapping of ( c ) Ag–K  ( d )

black/graphite electrode have been used as counter electrode materials due to their good conductivity  chemical inertness  excellent stability  and low cost  These electrodes unlock the enormous potential for low-cost  easy fabrication  and stable PSCs  721 Graphene Electrodes Graphene is a monolayer of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms that arranged in a honeycomb structure  which enable charge carriers to behave as Dirac fermions within this semimetal material [ 184 ]  This unique material possesses outstanding properties  such as high conductivity  excellent optical transmittance  good thermal and chemical stability  and remarkable mechanical properties  which make graphene useful in applications ranging from electronic devices to energy storage devices [ 185 ]  Its large π conjugated chemical structure make graphene exhibit ultrahigh carrier mobility  which is predicted to be 106 cm2 V−1·s accompanied with an intrinsic charge carrier concentration of 1012 cm−2 [ 186 ]  Consequently  graphene seems to be a suitable candidate as a conductive electrode in devices such as organic light-emitting diode [ 187 ]  solar cells [ 188189190 ]  and an electronic device  Peng et al  [ 191 ] first employed chemical vapor deposited graphene transparent electrodes as a counter electrode for semitransparent perovskite solar cells via lamination method  An intrinsic single-layer graphene film normally has a high sheet resistance of about 1050 ± 150 Ω sq−1  By introducing another PEDOT : PSS layer  the sheet resistance can be reduced to 260 ± 40 Ω sq−1  The sheet resistance can be further reduced when multilayer graphene and d-sorbitol modified PEDOT : PSS were used  Their devices with double-layer graphene electrodes show the maximum PCEs of 1202 % ± 032 % and 1165 % ± 035 % from the FTO and graphene sides  respectively  The good transparency of graphene also enabled their application as a transparent electrode for tandem solar cells  Lang et al  [ 192 ] used large-area graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition ( CVD ) as a highly transparent electrode in PSCs and achieved a PCE of 132 % for a four-terminal tandem solar cell with [ amorphous silica ] a-Si : H/ [ crystalline silica ] c-Si solar cell as bottom cell and graphene-based semitransparent PSC as a top cell ( cf  Table 73 )  Table 73 Summary of the device performance of perovskite solar cells with graphene counter electrode Full size table Graphene can be also directly deposited on the glass as a bottom conductive semitransparent electrode for PSCs  Sun et al  [ 193 ] used a chemical vapor deposited graphene transparent as a bottom conductive electrode for inverted PSCs  By adding a MoO3 layer  wettability and work function of the graphene electrode were tuned to enable a PCE of 171 %  Consider the excellent flexibility of graphene  they also fabricated flexible inverted PSCs with graphene/polyethylene naphthalate ( PEN ) substrate  giving a PCE of 168 % [ 194 ]  In addition  their flexible devices maintain 85 % of their initial PCE even after bending 5000 times at a bending radius of 2 mm  A flexible polyethylene terephthalate ( PET ) /graphene as a bottom electrode for PSCs has also been demonstrated  achieving a PCE of 115 %  high bending durability  and power output per weight ( specific weight ) of about 5 W/g [ 195 ]  However  the massive use of graphene electrode still faces major problems for scale-up production  quality issues  and inconveniences transfer stage [ 196 ]  In general  most of the high-quality graphene films are produced by CVD  While CVD is not suitable to obtain abundant high-quality graphene [ 196 ]  In addition  graphene usually is deposited on an insulator substrate  which makes it complicated to transfer graphene for actual application [ 196 ]  Batmunkh et al  [ 197 ] used solution-processed graphene as a bottom conductive electrode for PSCs  However  due to the poor quality of the graphene  a PCE of 062 % was obtained  Thus  it still appealing for developing low cost and simple high-quality graphene production method and application method [ 198 ]  For example  Yan et al  [ 199 ] employed chemically cleaved  multilayered graphene oxide as a counter electrode in an HTM-free PSCs  They demonstrated that multilayered graphene is a better hole extraction material for PSC  due to the as-formed Schottky barrier  Their graphene electrode-based device gave a PCE of 115 % ( cf  Table 73 )  722 Carbon Nanotube Electrode Carbon nanotubes ( CNTs ) are allotropes of carbon with a cylindrical nanostructure  Due to their unique π-electron system  CNTs possess excellent conductivity along the tubular axis  Due to their high length-to-diameter ratio ( 132 × 108:1 )  CNTs can be considered as conducting nanowires  The high carrier mobility  great chemical stability  unique nanostructure makes CNTs to be promising carbon materials for a conductive electrode [ 200 ]  In addition  CNTs exhibit excellent flexibility and optical transparency  Moreover  CNTs can be also used as hole transport materials in PSCs due to the inherent p-type nature with a work function in the range of 47–51 eV [ 200  201 ]  In general  CNTs are synthesized by arc discharge  laser ablation  CVD  and high-pressure carbon monoxide disproportionation  which usually require a vacuum or process with gases  However  the repeatability is a major problem with CVD growth due to the batch by batch process  In addition  the tendency to agglomerate  high cost  and low production yield of CNTs make it difficult to process for mass applications  Carbon nanotubes have been successfully used in PSCs in various applications  Li et al  [ 202 ] first used CNTs network as both HTMs and counter electrode in PSCs via lamination technique  Their HTM-free device with the configuration of FTO/ [ compact ] c-TiO2/ [ mesoporous ] m-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/CNTs gave a PCE of 687 %  The comparatively low efficiency may be due to the relatively high resistance of the CNT film and a lack of charge-selectivity  By adding spiro-OMeTAD beneath the CNTs network  the PCE of the devices were improved to 990 % due to the enhanced hole extraction and reduced recombination in solar cells  The good transparency of the CNTs network also allows the device to be illuminated from both sides  as shown in Fig  710  which makes the solar cells promising in building integrated photovoltaic applications  such as solar cell windows  Fig  710 figure 10 ( a ) Photo of freestanding CNT film lifting by tweezers to transfer onto other

Wei et al  [ 203 ] compared three types of HTM-free mesoscopic devices with multi-walled CNTs  carbon black  and graphite as a counter electrode as shown in Fig  711  They demonstrated that CNTs-based devices have high FF and hysteresis-free performance  which was attributed to two major factors : one is better electric contact and a suitable Schottky junction enable efficient charge transfer from CH3NH3PbI3 to CNTs  and the other one is higher conductivity enable faster charge transport in CNTs electrode  After optimization  their CNTs-based devices gave a PCE of 1267 %  Fig  711 figure 11

203 ]  Copyright ( 2015 )  Royal Society of Chemistry ) Full size image Qiu et al  [ 204 ] also attached an aligned CNT sheet on the top of perovskite as a counter electrode in flexible PSCs and achieved PCE of 949 %  Their flexible PSCs maintained 93 % of initial PCE after bending for 500 cycles at a bending curvature radius of 75 mm  Luo et al  [ 205 ] used cross-stacked super-aligned CNTs with excellent conductivity  porosity  and flexibility as a low-cost counter electrode for HTM-free mesoscopic PSCs with the configuration of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/Al2O3/CNT ( CH3NH3PbI3 )  In the device  the CNTs electrode was transferred on to Al2O3 before depositing perovskite  and perovskite was filled in all of the mesoporous layers  By doping the CNTs with iodine to enhance electrode conductivity and optimizing the thickness of CNTs electrode to increase grain size and improve crystallinity of perovskite  the efficiency of their device can be increased to 1054 % due to the significant improvement in the FF and Jsc  Additionally  their PSCs encapsulated with PMMA show outstanding stability in the dark and prolonged light soaking  A solid-state  flexible PSC with Ti foil as the bottom electrode and laminated CNTs film as the top transparent electrode was also been demonstrated [ 206 ]  In the device  incident light was illuminated from the transparent conductive CNT network  The flexible device gave a PCE of 831 % and show little performance deterioration after 100 mechanical bending cycles  These results suggested that both Ti foil and carbon nanotube have great potential for applications in PSCs  CNTs can be also mixed with other materials to modify the electrode  For example  Zheng et al  [ 207 ] used poly ( 3-hexylthiophene ) ( P3HT ) modified CNTs as counter electrode in HTM-free PSCs  The thin P3HT modifier acted as an electron blocker to inhibit electron transfer from perovskite to CNTs and also as a binder to tightly cross-link the CNTs to enhance the conductivity of the electrode and stability of the device  giving a PCE of 1343 %  Recently  the same authors modified CNTs by boron doping for the counter electrode in HTM-free PSCs [ 208 ]  The boron doping was demonstrated to enable enhanced hole extraction and transport by increasing work function  carrier concentration  and conductivity of CNTs  improving the PCE from 1070 % to 1460 %  By further introducing a thin layer of insulating Al2O3 on the mesoporous TiO2 film as a physical barrier to substantially reduce the charge losses  the PCE was further pushed to 1523 %  and the resultant device also showed good long-term stability  Carbon nanotubes can also made to paste ink  which can be deposited with a printing technique to avoid energy-consuming vacuum deposition  Gopi et al  [ 209 ] first employed a doctor blading coated CNTs electrode as a counter electrode for HTM-free mesoscopic normal structured PSCs  By optimizing the processing method to improve the charge collection  their devices gave a PCE of 783 %  Their high-vacuum-free deposition process in air simplifies the processing and lowers the threshold of both scientific research and industrial production of PSCs  Besides  CNTs can be also used as a counter electrode in a flexible fiber structure PSCs  For example  Qiu et al  [ 210 ] fabricated flexible fiber structured PSCs by continuously winding an aligned multi-walled CNTs sheet electrode onto a fiber electrode and obtained PCE of 33 %  Their fiber-like PSCs remained 95 % of initial PCE after 50 cycles bending  By controlling perovskite deposition and optimizing charge transport layer  they further improved the PCE of fiber-like PSCs to 71 % [ 211 ]  They also demonstrated PSCs fibers and fabrics twisted in three dimensions without obvious damage to the structure [ 212 ]  Their results indicated that fiber-like PSCs may be woven into electronic textiles for large-scale application by well-developed textile technologies ( cf  Table 74 )  Table 74 Summary of the device performance of perovskite solar cells with carbon nanotubes counter electrode Full size table 723 Conductive Carbon Electrode Carbon black can be easily obtained by burning carbonaceous materials such as coal  natural gas  and petroleum oil  Graphite can be obtained from natural graphite  Comparing with graphene CNTs  carbon black and graphite are abundantly available  very low-cost electrode materials  In general  carbon black is existed in the form of nanoparticles with large surface area  enabling good electrochemical properties  In graphite  the layered planar structure with honeycomb lattice is bonded in sp2 configuration with only three of the four potential binding sites of each carbon atom  The fourth electron is free to migrate in the plane  making graphite electrically conductive  In general  carbon black and graphite are mixed together with polymer or other additives to form conductive paste or ink  in which the graphite  typically tens of microns in length  provides excellent lateral conductivity  the carbon black particles with side of a few tens of nanometers act as conducting bridges between graphite  and the polymer or additive are used as bonder  This carbon black/graphite composite provides an excellent conductive matrix for high conductivity and excellent electric-chemical properties  Moreover  this kind of electrode can be deposited by a simple printing method  including doctor blading  screen printing  and roll to roll printing  which makes it possible to fabricate fully printable PSCs  In addition  chemical inertness  excellent stability  and hydrophobicity of carbon black and graphite make this kind of electrode to be promising for stable PSCs  In 1996  Kay et al  [ 213  214 ] firstly reported a new monolithic dye-sensitized solar cells based on cheap graphite/carbon black electrode  in which graphite was used to increase the lateral conductivity and carbon black was used to enhance the electrolyte regeneration and electric contact  and sometimes little amount of oxide  such as ZrO2  a binder to enhance the mechanical property of the electrode  Such electrode usually requires high-temperature annealing ( 400~500 °C ) to remove the organic compounds  such as hydroxypropyl cellulose  and create mesoporous pores for the filling of an absorber  Here we denote such a carbon electrode as a high-temperature carbon electrode  Based on the above monolithic structure  Ku et al  [ 11 ] first reported printable carbon black/graphite electrode-based PSCs with configuration of FTO/c-TiO2/-TiO2/m-ZrO2/m-carbon ( CH3NH3PbI3 )  where triple mesoporous layers were deposited by screen printing method  and the perovskite were filled in the mesoporous scaffold by drop casting perovskite precursor on the top of carbon layer  In this HTM-free device  the insulated ZrO2 layer can not transport charge and acted as a spacer to separate TiO2 and carbon to prevent short circuit  and perovskite itself in the mesoporous pores acted as conductor to transport photo-generated charge  the carbon with a work function of 50 eV can exact holes from perovskite as shown in Fig  712  They compared two carbon electrodes with carbon black/flaky graphite and carbon black/spheroidal graphite composites  respectively  Since the carbon counter electrode is the pathway for the infiltration of perovskite precursors  its structure plays an important role in the device performance in such carbon electrode-based PSCs  The loose structure and better conductivity of spheroidal graphite is favor of pore-filling of perovskite in the mesoporous layers  A better device performance ( PCE of 664 % ) was obtained for the carbon black/spheroidal graphite device  Most encouragingly  this kind of device maintained PCE of 65 % after 840 h storage in dry air at room temperature without encapsulation  which suggests the superior stability of carbon electrode PSCs  The same group also reported the employment of highly ordered mesoporous carbon with well-connected frameworks as a counter electrode in such HTM-free PSCs [ 215 ]  With lower charge resistance  the highly ordered mesoporous carbon-based device obtained a PCE of 702 %  Besides  the thickness of mesoporous carbon electrode will affect the crystallization of perovskite ; an over-thick carbon layer will restrict the diffusion perovskite precursor from the top carbon layer to the bottom layers  resulting in incomplete pore filling  while an over-thin carbon layer will decrease the FF of the device owing to the decrease of conductivity [ 216 ]  By optimizing the thickness of carbon electrode  device with an about 9 μm carbon layer gave the highest PCE of 1164 % [ 216 ]  The authors also investigated the influence of graphite diameters on device performance and found that 8 μm graphite-based carbon layer had a larger average pore size  a smaller square resistance  and a higher PCE [ 216 ]  Later  ultrathin graphite was also being incorporated into the high-temperature carbon electrode to increase the specific surface area of the carbon layer without sacrificing the conductivity [ 217 ]  The large specific surface area facilitated the hole collection from the perovskite to carbon layer  as well as the penetration of perovskite precursor solution in the carbon layer  resulting in improvement PCE from 1263 % to 1407 %  The charge collection at the counter electrode interface of the HTM-free device can significantly affect final device performance  Li et al  [ 218 ] found that the charge lifetime at the counter electrode interface is in the range of microsecond  which is much faster than that of titania/methylammonium lead iodide ( TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 ) interface with recombination lifetime at millisecond scale for the counter electrode-based HTM-free PSCs  Thus  the counter electrode interface dominates the charge recombination in such a device  By introducing single-walled carbon nanotube to tune the work function of the carbon layer  the charge collection was significantly enhanced  and charge recombination was suppressed  delivering a promising PCE of 147 % [ 218 ]  In addition  the binder also plays an important role in such high-temperature electrode  Xu et al  [ 219 ] used TiO2 nanoparticles as binders in a highly conductive carbon electrode for HTM-free PSCs  They found that carbon films were condensed by a dehydration reaction between surface hydroxyls from both TiO2 nanoparticles and carbon particles  which is beneficial for adhesion ability and conductivity of carbon film  and the formation and filling properties of perovskite  The sheet resistance can be reduced from 10 to 274 Ω sq−1 when annealed at a relatively lower temperature of 350 °C  resulting in an improvement of averaged PCEs from 540 ( ± 132 ) % to 921 ( ± 104 ) % and 1107 % ( champion )  Fig  712 figure 12 ( a ) Energy levels and ( b ) schematic

Copyright ( 2013 ) Nature Publishing Group ) Full size image Apart from optimizing the counter electrode  the device performance of the high-temperature carbon electrode-based HTM-free PSCs can be also optimized by tuning TiO2 layer [ 220221222223 ] or spacer layer [ 224  225 ]  TiO2/perovskite interfacial engineering [ 226 ]  solvent engineering to improve perovskite quality [ 227  228 ]  and composition engineering to enhance device performance [ 224  229230231232233 ]  respectively  An impressive breakthrough in device stability for the counter electrode-based HTM-free PSCs was achieved by incorporating 5-ammoniumvaleric acid ( 5-AVA ) into methylammonium lead iodide ( CH3NH3PbI3 )  which significantly improved pore-filling and perovskite quality [ 234 ]  Such device achieved a certified PCE of 128 % with over 1000 h stability in ambient air under full sunlight [ 234 ] and also excellent stability in the hot desert climate and indoor long-term light soaking as well as heat exposure during three months at 80–85 °C [ 235 ]  Besides of the excellent stability and compatibility of a fully printable method of such carbon electrode-based HTM-free PSCs  the demonstration of automation perovskite deposition method [ 78  236 ] and solar modules [ 237  238 ] suggest the promising potential for commercializing of such devices  The carbon electrode usually does not exhibit good charge selectivity  the TiO2/methylammonium lead iodide ( TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 ) heterojunction is the only efficient charge separation interface in HTM-free PSCs  the inefficient charge collection at the counter electrode interface leads to serious charge recombination  To solve this problem  Liu et al  introduced a nickel ( II ) oxide ( NiO ) layer as hole transport materials into high temperature carbon electrode-based PSCs and exploited two device structures with configuration of fluorine-doped tin oxide/compact-TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/mesoporous nickel ( II ) oxide/mesoporous carbon methylammonium lead iodide [ FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/m-NiO/m-carbon ( CH3NH3PbI3 ) ] ( [ n-type/p-type ] n/p structure  as shown in Fig  713c ) [ 239 ] and fluorine-doped tin oxide/compact-TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/mesoporous zirconium/nickel ( II ) oxide/mesoporous carbon methylammonium lead iodide [ FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/m-ZrO2/m-NiO/m-carbon ( CH3NH3PbI3 ) ] [ 240  241 ] ( [ n-type/undoped intrinsic/p-type semiconductor ] n/i/p structure  as shown in Fig  713d )  They proved that the introduction of NiO can facilitate hole extraction at the counter electrode interface and prolong the charge recombination time  obtained much improved Voc and a PCE of 11 % for n/p device [ 239 ]  With an additional zirconium ( IV ) oxide ( ZrO2 ) layer between the TiO2 layer and NiO layer  the charge recombination can be further suppressed  leading to much-improved PCE to 149 % [ 240 ]  Similarly  carbon electrode-based [ negative-type/positive-type semiconductor ] n/p and [ n-type/undoped intrinsic semiconductor/p-type semiconductor ] n/i/p PSCs also exhibited good stability due to the thick active layer and also the hydrophobicity of carbon electrode as above HTM-free device  Fig  713

excellent device stability and promising device performance  all the mesoporous layers require high energy consuming high-temperature annealing  which may significantly increase the energy pay-back time of the PSCs and also make this kind of device not compatible with the flexible substrate  To solve this problem  a high-temperature carbon electrode can be replaced by a low-temperature carbon electrode  while the processing is different from the high-temperature device  Similar to regular PSCs  carbon electrode can be also deposited as top counter electrode after formation of perovskite  In this case  the high temperature is no longer needed  and the carbon used is denoted as low-temperature carbon  Zhang et al  [ 242 ] and Zhou et al  [ 243 ] reported doctor blading coated low-temperature commercial carbon as a counter electrode for HTM-free PSCs with the configuration of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/carbon as shown in Fig  714 and achieved PCE of 831 % and 908 %  respectively  In their device  perovskite was deposited on the TiO2 layer and carbon was deposited after the formation of perovskite  High-temperature annealing of the carbon is no longer needed  but the carbon ink should not contain a component that can destroy the perovskite layer  Thus  Zhou et al  [ 243 ] removed the solvent in the commercial carbon ink and used chlorobenzene as a dispersing agent to enable the coating process  Besides  the perovskite layer should be compact enough to act as a spacer layer to separate the carbon layer and TiO2 layer to avoid short circuit  Fig  714 figure

for HTM-free PSCs  In their devices  a predeposited PbI2 layer acted as a spacer layer to separate the TiO2 and the carbon layer and the PbI2 layer transformed to the perovskite layer at a later stage via a two-step method  They found that the candle soot-based carbon electrode exhibited good hole extraction and electron blocking properties by forming a Schottky junction as shown in Fig  715c  By optimizing the fabrication process  the interface contact of CH3NH3PbI3/carbon can be significantly enhanced as shown in Fig  715d and e As a result  their roll coated carbon electrode-based HTM-free PSCs gave a PCE of 1102 %  Also  optimizing carbon electrode to improve charge transport in the carbon and tuning the perovskite/carbon interface to improve charge extraction from perovskite to carbon were carried out to further improve device performance  Fig  715 figure 15 ( a ) A digital photograph portraying the flame deposition of candle soot  ( b ) Cross-sectional SEM image of the sponge-like

electrode consisting of a mesoscopic carbon layer and another highly conductive industrial flexible graphite sheet as a second extraction layer for HTM-free PSCs  By optimizing the size and morphology of carbon materials to enable good electrical contact at the CH3NH3PbI3/carbon interface  their devices gave a PCE of 102 %  Wei et al  [ 77 ] demonstrated an inkjet-printed carbon electrode-based planar PSC  To achieve a good electric contact at the CH3NH3PbI3/carbon interface  they developed an inkjet printing technique to deposit carbon black + CH3NH3I ink on the top of predeposited lead ( II ) iodide ( PbI2 ) to transform PbI2 to methylammonium lead iodide ( CH3NH3PbI3 ) in situ and created an interpenetrating interface between CH3NH3PbI3 and carbon electrode to suppress charge recombination and enhance charge collection  The waterproof properties of the counter electrode are beneficial for the long-term stability of PSCs  Wei et al  [ 246 ] also reported an HTM-free PSC based on a carbon + epoxy/Ag electrode and obtained a PCE of 1099 %  In their device  the epoxy was introduced into a commercialized carbon ink to achieve better waterproof properties and interface electrical contact  An additional hydrophobic silver ( Ag ) paste layer was deposited on the top blade coated carbon layer via brush coating to further enhance the waterproof property and conductivity of the counter electrode  As a result  their device can be directly immersed in water and no performance degradation occurred at the first 80 min  Moreover  nearly no device performance degradation was observed under high humidity and 50 °C thermal stressing condition for 250 h Yue et al  [ 247 ] also optimized the ratio of carbon black particles and graphite flakes in low-temperature carbon electrode to modulate the connection of carbon black and graphite flakes  and also the contact between the counter electrode and perovskite layer  achieving a PCE of 729 %  Liu et al  [ 248 ] also reported a low-temperature carbon electrode to consist of graphite flakes  carbon black powder  and nano-graphite powder for HTM-free PSCs  The size and ration of carbon material also were found to affect the conductivity of the carbon electrode and electric contact at the CH3NH3PbI3/carbon interface  Their relevant devices gave a PCE of 688 % and excellent stability  Chen et al  [ 249 ] used boron and phosphorus co-doped carbon with different work function and conductivity as the counter electrode in HTM-free PSCs  delivering a PCE of 678 %  which is higher than those of pristine carbon ( 372 % )  phosphorus-doped carbon ( 539 % )  and boron-doped carbon ( 520 % ) -based PSCs  Cheng et al  [ 250 ] introduced multi-walled CNTs into the perovskite layer to enhance the electric contact of perovskite and carbon electrode in carbon electrode based HTM-free PSCs  They proved that CNTs can act as charge transport high way between individual perovskite nanoparticles and facilitate charge collection at the counter electrode interface  leading to a ∼15 % improvement of averaged PCE ( 116 % )  Yu et al  [ 251 ] reported a bi-layer back contact consisting of a carbon/CH3NH3I composite layer and a compact hydrophobic carbon layer as a counter electrode for HTM-free PSCs  The cell showed a final PCE of 136 % from an initial PCE of 113 % after thermal stress  and the encapsulated cell retained 90 % of the initial PCE after water exposure and under thermal stress at 150 °C for half an hour  Besides above described low-temperature carbon electrode processed with blade coating or other printing methods  low-temperature carbon electrode can be also processed with a transfer method  A free-standing thermoplastic carbon film with good flexibility and conductivity was also being developed and hot pressed onto the perovskite layer as a counter electrode for HTM-free PSCs [ 252 ]  By optimizing the composition of carbon films and hot-pressing pressure  a PCE of 1353 % was achieved  Low-cost carbon cloth was applied in PSCs with a configuration of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/carbon  giving champion stabilized PCE of 148 % ( PCE of 1529 % from J-V curve ) and good stability [ 253 ]  Apart from optimizing the counter electrode  the device performance and stability of low-temperature carbon electrode-based PSCs can be also optimized by tuning TiO2 layer [ 254255256257258 ]  improving perovskite quality [ 259260261262263 ]  and composition engineering [ 264265266 ]  respectively  Furthermore  the introduction of a hole transport layer between perovskite and carbon electrode can also improve the device performance and enhance device stability of low-temperature carbon electrode-based PSCs [ 267268269 ]  The carbon materials electrode-based PSCs has attracted much attention due to their outstanding advantages such as low-cost  vacuum-free  long-term stablility  easy fabrication process  compatibility  etc  However  some issues are still associated with carbon materials electrode-based PSCs  The first issue is their lower efficiency when compared with high-efficiency metal thin-film electrode-based PSC  This is because of that most of the carbon electrode-based PSCs adopt a HTM-free device structure  which leads to different working mechanism from a regular p-i-n structure  In PSCs  the Voc is determined by the difference of electron quasi-Fermi levels ( Efn ) and the hole quasi-Fermi levels ( Efp ) [ 160 ]  In the p-i-n device  Efn is determined by the interaction of electron transport medium ( ETM ) and perovskite  and Efp is determined by the interaction of HTM [ 160 ]  Both perovskite/ETM interface and the perovskite/HTM interface exhibit good charge selectivity for efficient charge separation  which leads to Voc range from 10 to12 V However  in HTM-free device  the absence of HTM leads to inefficient charge separation at the counter electrode interface  resulting in fast charge recombination at this interface with nearly three orders of magnitude reduction in charge recombination lifetime [ 218 ]  and lower Voc range from 08 to10 V [ 160 ]  In terms of counter electrode  the inferior electric contact at the counter electrode interface in carbon electrode PSCs can also result in serious charge recombination and low Voc  Thus  it is necessary to modulate the counter electrode interface of carbon electrode-based PSCs to improve the Voc aiming at high efficiency  So far  several strategies have been made to improve the Voc of carbon electrode-based PSCs  including in developing p-i-n like structure device by introducing another HTM layer [ 239  241  269 ]  using carbon material with lower Fermi level [ 218  270 ]  optimizing the electric contact at the counter electrode interface [ 250 ]  In terms of the JSC  regular PSCs device with metal electrode usually gave a Jsc at the range of 21–23 mA/cm2  However  the Jsc of carbon electrode-based PSCs is at the range 17–20 mA/cm2  This is due to the fact that the mirror-like metal electrode can reflect the light enable a secondary absorption of the light by perovskite with a thickness of 400–600 nm [ 271 ]  While the carbon electrode can not reflect light  a thicker perovskite with thickness over 1 μm is required for complete light absorption [ 160 ]  Thus  it requires efficient charge transportation and collection within the carbon-based PSCs with such thick perovskite layer  Furthermore  the relative lower conductivity of the carbon electrode and inferior electric contact at the counter electrode interface result in lower FF at range from 06 to 07  when compared with metal electrode PSCs possessing FF at range from 075 to 08  When comes to large area PSCs module  the conductivity of the electrode significantly affects the total sheet resistance ( cf  Table 75 )  Therefore  it is desirable to develop a carbon electrode with higher conductivity combining good electric contact with the bottom layer to improve FF  Table 75 Summary of the device performance of perovskite solar cells with conductive carbon counter electrode Full size table In view of processing  high-temperature carbon electrode-based PSCs require high energy consuming high-temperature annealing  which may significantly increase the energy pay-back time of the PSCs and also make this kind of device not compatible with the flexible substrate  For low-temperature carbon electrode PSCs  the low-temperature carbon ink may damage the bottom layer during the deposition process  Thus  a polar solvent in commercial carbon ink should be removed before the deposition [ 243 ]  and binder and additive should also be carefully selected to avoid the possibility of damaging the bottom layer  724 Conductive Metal Oxides Electrode Transparent conducting oxides ( TCOs ) are the most commonly used materials for a bottom transparent conductive electrode in an electronic device and photovoltaic device due to their excellent transparency and conductivity  TCOs materials can be also used as a top counter electrode  especially in transparent solar cells or tandem solar cell  When used as a top electrode  the TCOs such as indium tin oxide ( ITO ) is usually deposited by magnetron sputtering  However  the high-energy sputtered particles and high temperatures during deposition and post-annealing may damage the perovskite layer and the organic charge transport layers  To solve this problem  Löper et al  [ 272 ] first reported a four-terminal crystalline silicon ( c-Si ) /PSC tandem solar cells with molybdenum n-oxide/ indium tin oxide ( MoOx/ITO ) electrode possessing a series resistance of 196 Ω sq−1 as top transparent electrode for the normal structured mesoscopic PSCs top cell as shown in Fig  716a  where the MoOx layer not only acted as a buffer layer to protect the bottom spiro-OMeTAD layer but also a hole extraction layer to help the hole collection at the counter electrode interface  Their top PSCs with ITO counter electrode gave a PCE of 62 %  and the final tandem solar cells gave a PCE of 134 %  Fig  716 figure 16 ( a ) Schematic of the mechanically stacked four-terminal tandem consist of an

aluminum-doped zinc oxide ( AZO ) nanoparticles as a buffer layer with both efficient hole-blocking properties and bottom PCBM protective capability beneath the sputtered ITO layer for transparent inverted planar PSC  Their ITO layer with a thickness of 500 nm on the top of the AZO films achieved a sheet resistance of 99 Ω sq−1 after annealing at 100 °C  Their four-terminal [ crystalline ] c-Si//PSC tandem solar cells achieved PCE of 180 %  An ITO counter electrode-based semitransparent PSC with an efficiency of 12 % and near-infrared transmittance of > 80 % was demonstrated by Duong et al  [ 274 ] Their four-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells have an efficiency of 201 %  Another promising conductive electrode is indium zinc oxide ( IZO )  An IZO top transparent electrode-based four-terminal c-Si/PSC tandem solar cells with or without MoOx buffer layer as shown in Figs  716b and c exhibited nearly identical efficiency approaching 182 % [ 275 ]  To minimize damage to the underlying layers during the TCO deposition  a soft zinc oxide/aluminum ( ZnO : Al ) sputter process was developed by Kranz et al  [ 276 ] for copper indium gallium selenide ( CIGS ) /perovskite solar cell ( PSC ) four terminal tandem solar cells  The semitransparent PSCs achieved PCE of 121 % and an AVT of 71 % at a wavelength range from 800 and 1000 nm and the CIGS/PSC four terminal tandem solar cells achieved PCE of 195 % [ 142 ]  McMeekin et al  [ 277 ] developed a wide band gap perovskite formamidinium ( FA ) cesium-methyl ammonium mixed-cation lead iodide/bromide [ FA083Cs017Pb ( I06Br04 ) 3 ] ( ~174 eV ) with the solution-processed indium tin oxide ( ITO ) nanoparticles as a buffer between the spiro-OMeTAD and the ITO  A PCE of 151 % and a stabilized PCE of 125 % were obtained  Yang et al  [ 278 ] used a MAPbI3-based cell with configuration of indium tin oxide/nickel ( II ) oxide/methylammonium lead iodide [ 66 ] -Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl

ITO/NiOx/perovskite/PCBM/SnO2/ZnO/ITO to form a four terminal perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cell  and achieved stabilized efficiency of 203 %  Fan et al  [ 280 ] deposited an hydrogen-doped indium oxide ( In2O3 : H ) layer with a thickness of 149 nm via a room-temperature radio-frequency magnetron sputtering ; the resultant electrode without post-annealing can deliver a reasonably high mobility of 513 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a sheet resistance of 257 Ω sq−1  When used as transparent electrodes for a semitransparent PSC featuring  configuration of FTO/ZnO/PCBM/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/MoO3/In2O3 : H  the relevant device gave a steady-state efficiency of 142 % along with 72 % AVT in the near-infrared region  Moreover  they stacked the semitransparent PSC with a low-bandgap CIGS cell to construct a four-terminal tandem solar cell and demonstrated an efficiency of 205 %  Transparent conducting oxides ( TCOs ) are widely used as the

Perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cells can be also fabricated in a two-terminal tandem cell form  Different from an above-described device fabricated with layer by layer process  Heo et al  [ 283 ] laminated an FTO/ [ thick dense blocking ] bl-TiO2/MAPbBr3/wet [ poly ( 3-hexylthiophene-25-diyl ) ] P3HT or [ poly ( triarylamine ) ] PTAA sub-cell and the PCBM/MAPbI3/PEDOT : PSS/ITO sub-cell by pressurizing with double clip and subsequent drying  By optimizing the tunnel junction  their tandem solar cells gave a PCE of 104 %  In the work of Eperon et al  [ 279 ] described above  they also fabricated a two terminal perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cell featuring a configuration of ITO/NiOx/FA075Cs025Sn05Pb05I3/PCBM/SnO2/ZnO/ITO/PEDOT : PSS/FA075Cs025Sn05Pb05I3/C60/BCP/Ag with FA075Cs025Sn05Pb05I3 perovskite ( 12 eV ) and FA075Cs025Sn05Pb05I3 perovskite ( 18 eV )  and achieved efficiency of 170 % with a Voc of 165 V Although TCOs-based PSC or tandem solar cell gained remarkable achievement  they are also facing some challenges for future large-scale use  Taking ITO for example  the limitation of global indium resources and the high cost of indium is one of the greatest concerns for the boosted demand of ITO for PV device  The high vacuum-based deposition techniques and low ITO resource utilization rate also add to the cost of ITO  In addition  the high-temperature deposition process and the brittle nature of ITO hamper its applications in a flexible device  Aside from the high cost of raw materials and deposition processes  the high-energy processing condition also damages the underlying organic materials without a buffer  Although the employment of buffer can relieve the damage of underlying organic materials  this can increase the complexity of the processing and cost of the process  Thus  it is desirable to develop an alternative for conductive metal oxides ( cf  Table 76 )  Table 76 Summary of the device performance of perovskite solar cells with conductive metal oxide counter electrode Full size table 725 Conductive Polymers Electrode Conductive polymers are organic polymers that conduct electricity through a large number of delocalized π system  The conductivity and absorption of the polymers can be tuned by modifying their chemical structure  which makes it possible to achieve good conductivity and suitable optical bandgap  When the bandgap is large enough  the conductive polymer is a good candidate for a transparent electrode  The organic nature of the conductive polymer also makes this kind of materials to be of low cost  In addition  conductive polymers can be dispersed in a solvent  which makes them processable with a simple deposition method  such as spin coating  spray coating  etc  PEDOT is one of the most used conductive polymers for a transparent conductive layer in the form of PEDOT : PSS dispersions  Furthermore  PEDOT : PSS also showed very good flexibility  which is suitable for a flexible device  PEDOT : PSS have been used for both the bottom conductive electrode and the top counter electrode  Sun et al  [ 284 ] deposited PEDOT : PSS films on rigid glass or flexible PET substrate as a conductive electrode for inverted planar PSCs  and achieved efficiency of 11 % for the rigid PSCs and efficiency of 86 % for the flexible PSCs  Transparent top PEDOT : PSS electrode could be a good candidate for the above-described metal thin film or TCOs counter electrode due to their easy fabrication  high transmittance  and high conductivity and low cost  Conducting polymers have been used as a counter electrode for PSCs  Jiang et al  [ 285 ] first reported PEDOT : PSS as the top electrode of PSCs with the structure of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/PEDOT : PSS via a transfer-lamination technique  Their device fabricated in gave a PCE of 1129 %  which suggested their method was a simple method to lowers the threshold of both scientific research and industrial production of PSCs  Bu et al  [ 286 ] deposited a PEDOT : PSS on commercial plastic wrap to form a thin film to avoid using PDMS substrate  and then the PEDOT ; PSS electrode was laminated on the top of hole transport layer as the transparent counter electrode as shown in Fig  718  Their semitransparent PSCs gave a PCE of 101 % with an active area of 006 cm2  29 % with an active area of 1 cm2  and AVT of 73 %  By replacing the Ag electrode with the PEDOT : PSS transparent electrode  Xiao et al  [ 287 ] also reported a PCE of 821 % with AVT of 23 % at a wavelength range from 390 to 700 nm  The good transmittance of semi-transparent PEDOT : PSS enables the use as light penetration side electrode for an opaque bottom substrate-based PSCS  Xiao et al  [ 288 ] employed PEDOT : PSS as a counter electrode for a Ti foil-based PSCs  Another ITO/PEN laminated on the top of PEDOT : PSS was used to improve the charge separation and transportation  As a result  the Ti foil-based PSC achieved efficiency of 1307 % with an active area of 100 cm2  Their promising results highlighted the potential application of the PEDOT and Ti foil in cost-effective  large-area  and flexible PSCs [ 288 ]  Fig  718 figure 18 Pictures of the semitransparent PSCs with a configuration of ( FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/PEDOT : PSS ) : ( a ) the

semitransparent PSCs with PEDOT : PSS counter electrode  ( Reproduced with permission from Ref  [ 286 ]  Copyright ( 2015 ) American Chemical Society ) Full size image Although  the employment of PEDOT : PSS as counter electrode have been successfully demonstrated  PEDOT : PSS also suffer from some drawbacks which hamper their application in PSCs  One major disadvantage is the acidic and aqueous nature of PEDOT : PSS  which causes cell degradation when used in PSCs  In general  some additives were used to modify the PEDOT : PSS to increase the conductivity  However  PEDOT : PSS film prepared from the dispersion also showed relatively low conductivity than that of metal or ITO  which may increase the sheet resistance of the device  Besides  the poor stability of the conductive polymer itself is another concern for the application in PSCs  Thus  it is desirable to develop stable conductive polymer materials for the conductive electrode application ( cf  Table 77 )  Table 77 Summary of the device performance of perovskite solar cells with PEDOT : PSS counter electrode Full size table 73 Perspectives In this chapter  we have reviewed recent progress on the counter electrode materials for PSCs  including metal thin-film electrode  super-thin metal thin-film electrode  nanostructured metal electrode  graphene electrode  carbon nanotube electrode  carbon black/graphite electrode  conductive oxide electrode  and polymer electrode  Although there are a variety of electrode materials and electrode structures suitable for counter electrode of PSCs  to find a suitable counter electrode for PSCs  several important factors such as the function of the counter electrode  the cost of the materials  and relevant deposition technique should be carefully considered to achieve efficient charge collection and expected photovoltaic application  Furthermore  the counter electrode also plays an important role in the long-term stability of the PSCs  Thus  it is appealing to develop novel electrode materials and also suitable integrating process for counter electrode in PSCs towards future commercialized photovoltaic  ReferencesBesides high efficiency  the stability and reproducibility of perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) are also key for their commercialization  Herein  we report a simple perovskite formation method to fabricate perovskite films with thickness over 1 μm in ambient condition on the basis of the fast gas−solid reaction of chlorine-incorporated hydrogen lead triiodide and methylamine gas  The resultant thick and smooth chlorine-incorporated perovskite films exhibit full coverage  improved crystallinity  low surface roughness and low thickness variation  The resultant PSCs achieve an average power conversion efficiency of 191 ± 04 % with good reproducibility  Meanwhile  this method enables an active area efficiency of 153 % for 5 cm × 5 cm solar modules  The un-encapsulated PSCs exhibit an excellent T80 lifetime exceeding 1600 h under continuous operation conditions in dry nitrogen environment  Similar content being viewed by others Advances in the Application of Perovskite Materials Article Open

additive Article 16 February 2024 Introduction Organic−inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) have drawn a great deal of attention in the photovoltaic research community due to their high efficiency and simple manufacturing process12345  The power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of PSCs has reached over 22 % 6  Similar to other kinds of thin film photovoltaics  film qualities of perovskite layers can heavily influence device performance of PSCs  Thus  a delicate control of film quality of perovskite layers is key to achieving both superior performance and high reproducibility  Many solution processable perovskite formation methods have been developed to fabricate high-quality perovskite films  such as one-step method2789 and two-step method10  These methods usually involve a transformation of 2D lead halide inorganic framework to the 3D perovskite structure  This structure transformation is often accompanied with the formation of morphological defects and crystallographic structure dislocation within the grain and at grain boundaries  where defects are present as trap states causing serious charge recombination and limiting the charge carrier diffusion length ( less than 1 μm ) 1112  To ensure efficient charge collection in the presence of defects  perovskite films are usually made sufficiently thin  So far  high efficiency PSCs mainly adopt perovskite films with thickness ranging from 400 to 800 nm ( Supplementary Table 1 )  The low thickness fluctuation tolerance and morphological defects of thin perovskite films decrease reproducibility of the fabrication process  Moreover  thin films are prone to thickness variations and pinhole defects  which increase significantly with the area  It is obvious that thicker perovskite films are likely to reduce the risk of forming voids and pinholes due to the larger thickness fluctuation tolerance  A high-quality thick perovskite film is desirable to achieve a high device yield and reproducibility in making large-area solar modules  Besides  thicker perovskite films can not only improve the light harvesting1314  but also broaden light response region by utilizing the below-band absorption15  As such  it is advantageous to construct a high-quality thick perovskite film with enough carrier diffusion length in PSCs to endorse both higher efficiency and manufacturing viability  However  thick perovskite films over 1 μm have been found to be generally less efficient than thin-films devices due to the poor mobility  limited carrier diffusion length and are seldom explored ( Supplementary Table 1 )  Moreover  conventional perovskite formation methods are usually not suitable for fabricating large-area high-quality thick perovskite films  Thus  improving the quality of thick perovskite films is critical to balance the thickness and efficiency  Also  the development of new perovskite formation techniques is desirable to construct high-quality and thick perovskite films  Recently  a perovskite formation process based on methylamine ( CH3NH2 ) gas−solid reaction has been developed to prepare high-quality CH3NH3PbX3 ( X = I  Br  Cl )  mixed halides CH3NH3+-based perovskite and Cesium/CH3NH3+ mixed cations perovskite films161718  This gas−solid reaction-based method introduces a liquid intermediate  which leads to induced morphology reconstruction  defects healing1920  Meanwhile  CH3NH2 gas treatment can help reduce the defect density in perovskite films1920 and also elimination of I213  Besides  CH3NH2-induced δ-NH2CH=NH2PbI3 in ( CH3NH3 ) x ( NH2CH=NH2 ) 1−xPbI3 is also reported to passivate trap states to improve device performance21  Moreover  excess solvent is absent during this perovskite formation process  which avoids the possible detrimental effect-related residue solvent  Therefore  CH3NH2 gas-based processes are promising for depositing high-quality perovskite films across large area for PSC device fabrication2223  In terms of the synthetic techniques developed for perovskite  using chloride containing raw materials to prepare perovskite is a commonly used method3  Although the chlorine content in resultant perovskite films is usually much lower than the nominal ratio of chlorine added in the precursor solution and in some cases the chorine content in fully annealed perovskite films is below detection limit  both the optoelectronic properties and morphology can be tuned by appropriate chlorine incorporation2425  The resultant carrier diffusion length improvement1112  defects density reduction26  optimization of film growth272829  and charge tranport3031 make this method effective in obtaining high-quality perovskite films  In particular  CH3NH3PbI3−xClx ( ie  CH3NH3PbI3 incorporated with a small amount of Cl ) has been reported to exhibit a longer carrier diffusion length over 1 μm compared with pure CH3NH3PbI3  and as a result device performance improved dramatically1112  These earlier works have inspired us to combine the CH3NH2 gas-based perovskite formation method and partial substitution of iodine ions by chorine ions to fabricate high quality over 1-μm-thick perovskite films with a sufficient charge diffusion length  which is not only beneficial for better light absorbing but also desirable for fabricating large-area solar modules with high yield and reproducibility via low-cost printing techniques1332  Here we report a simple perovskite formation method to fabricate over 1-μm-thick perovskite films based on the fast gas−solid reaction of chlorine-incorporated hydrogen lead triiodide ( HPbI3 ( Cl ) ) and CH3NH2 gas  The comprehensive characterization results reveal that with the synergistic effect of CH3NH2 gas and partial substitution of iodine ions by chorine ions  the resultant CH3NH3PbI3 ( Cl ) ( MAPbI3 ( Cl ) ) films with a thickness over 1 μm and low thickness variation exhibit excellent film quality  The resultant PSCs gave an average PCE of 191 % and low PCE standard deviation ( ±04 % )  which indicates the excellent reproducibility of this method  Meanwhile  this method enables an active area PCE of 153 % for 5 cm × 5 cm solar modules  Besides  the un-encapsulated PSCs exhibit an excellent T80 lifetime exceeding 1600 h under continuous operation conditions in dry N2 environment  Our film stability study also offers the in-depth understanding for the underlying mechanisms responsible for device stability improvement  Results Perovskite formation Conventional perovskite formation methods are usually not suitable for fabricating high-quality thick perovskite thin films ( Supplementary Fig  1 )  Here  we developed a fast gas−solid reaction of HPbI3 ( Cl ) and CH3NH2 gas to prepare high-quality thick perovskite films  In this method  hydrogen lead triiodide ( HPbI3 ) was used as the starting material aiming at taking advantage of its fully coordinated [ PbI3 ] − structure to reduce iodide-vacancy and improve film quality ( Supplementary Figs  2  3 ) 3334  Firstly  we tuned the thickness of perovskite films based on the HPbI3–CH3NH2 reaction20 by varying the substrate temperature ( Supplementary Figs  4  5  6  Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Note 1 )  As a result  perovskite films with thickness about 11 μm are used as our benchmark for further studies  Partial substitution of iodine ions by chorine ions step depicted in Fig  1a was achieved by reacting CH3NH3Cl ( MACl ) with HPbI3 to form HPbI3 ( Cl )  Considering that MACl exists in the solid state at room temperature but sublimes at elevated temperatures ( higher than 100 °C )  the introduction of MACl can not only achieve a small amount of substitution of iodine ions by chorine ions  but also tune the morphology of HPbI3 ( Cl ) films2735  Top set in Fig  1b shows the top-view scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) images of HPbI3 ( Cl ) films prepared using HPbI3/MACl precursor solution with different MACl contents  It is found that upon increasing the MACl content  the size of voids between islands-like crystals in the HPbI3 ( Cl ) films gradually decreases  and the crystals gradually turn from the hexagonal shape to the square shape and then to crystals with round edges ( Supplementary Fig  7 )  The enhanced coverage of HPbI3 ( Cl ) films is expected to be beneficial for the subsequent CH3NH2 gas-based perovskite formation process  Fig  1 figure 1 Perovskite film formation  a Schematic drawing showing the reaction process of partial substitution of iodine ions by chorine ions to form chlorine-incorporated perovskite MAPbI3 ( Cl ) films : First  iodine ions in HPbI3 are partially substituted by chorine ions to form HPbI3 ( Cl )  Then HPbI3 ( Cl ) reacts with CH3NH2 gas to form MAPbI3 ( Cl ) via the ultra-fast acid-base reaction  b Top-view SEM images of HPbI3 ( Cl ) ( top set  scale bar : 50 μm ) and MAPbI3 ( Cl ) ( bottom set  scale bars : 5 μm ) films prepared using different molar ratios of MACl versus HPbI3 in the HPbI3/MACl precursor solution Full size image Table 1 The SCLC results for FTO/perovskite/Au devices based on 11-μm-thick MAPbI3 ( Cl ) and MAPbI3 films prepared by HPbI3 ( Cl ) /CH3NH2 method  and MAPbI3 ( AS ) film prepared by the antisolvent method Full size table To further investigate the incorporation of chlorine into the HPbI3  we used X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) spectroscopy to characterize the obtained HPbI3 ( Cl ) films  It is reported that the HPbI3 films show a hexagonal structure203436  Upon increasing MACl content from 0 to 020  the low-angle peak around 117° shifts to a higher two theta value and the peak intensity increases significantly ( Supplementary Fig  8 )  This result suggests that the substitution of I– ion with smaller Cl– ion can shrink the crystal lattice  and HPbI3 ( Cl ) still preserves the pseudo-hexagonal phase in the case of MACl content lower than 04  When the MACl content is increased to 040  the XRD peak intensity of the HPbI3 ( Cl ) film at around 117° reduced substantially  This observation suggests that when the MACl content is too high  the crystal structure of HPbI3 ( Cl ) can not maintain the previous structure  which is also supported by the observed shape difference of crystal islands by SEM ( Supplementary Fig  7 )  This is because the large difference between the ionic radii of I– and Cl– makes the crystal structure unstable when the content of chlorine is too high  Such a phenomenon has also been observed in MAPbI3−xClx  When a small amount of Cl was incorporated  MAPbI3−xClx can still maintain the pseudo-cubic phase1112  However  a continuous solid phase of MAPbI3−xClx theoretically can not form at a high chlorine content due to the large size mismatch between chloride and iodide30  Besides  a slight splitting of the XRD peaks around 117° and the formation of MAPbI3 are observed for high MACl content of 070 and 100 cases  The former observation may be due to the incomplete removal of MACl or phase separation of HPbI3 ( Cl )  and the latter observation suggests that the reaction of MACl with HPbI3 can form MAPbI3  The nonvisible perovskite peaks in HPbI3 ( Cl ) films at low MACl content from 005 to 040 may be due to the low amount of MAPbI3 seeds and detection limit of XRD  Here  we can deduce that the possible reaction for the formation of HPbI3 ( Cl ) at low MACl content up to 040 is as follows : begin { array } { l } { mathrm { HPbI } } _ { mathrm { 3 } } + left ( { { { x } } + { { y } } } right ) { mathrm { MACl } } to { mathrm { H } } _ { { { 1 - x } } } { mathrm { Pb } } _ { { { 1 - x } } } { mathrm { I } } _ { { { 3 - 4x } } } { mathrm { Cl } } _ { { x } }  + { { x { mathrm { MAPbI } } } } _ { mathrm { 3 } } + { { x { mathrm { HI } } } }   left ( { mathrm { g } } right ) + { { y { mathrm { MACl } } } }   left ( { mathrm { g } } right ) end { array }  ( 1 ) where the chlorine-incorporated HPbI3  ie  H1−xPb1−xI3−4xClx is termed as HPbI3 ( Cl ) hereafter ; for MACl  x + y represents the initial amount of MACl in the HPbI3/MACl precusor solution  x represents the amount of MACl used for chlorine incorporation  y represents the amount of MACl that sublimes during thermal annealing  The as-prepared HPbI3 ( Cl ) films were then exposed to CH3NH2 gas atmosphere to form perovskite via the reaction  CH3NH2 + H+ → CH3NH3+ 20  As shown in Fig  1b bottom set  the apparent grain size of the MAPbI3 ( Cl ) films gradually increases upon the increase of MACl content  However  too much MACl is found to cause significant deterioration of the film morphology  especially for the MACl content of 100 case ( Supplementary Fig  9 )  The structural properties of MAPbI3 ( Cl ) films were further examined by XRD ( Fig  2a  b and Supplementary Fig  10 )  All the samples show a preferred orientation along the ( 110 ) crystallographic plane  and the corresponding peak intensity becomes stronger with consecutive substitution of iodine ions by chorine ions  This preferable ( 110 ) crystal orientation is induced by the CH3NH2-based perovskite formation process1937  The gradually increased peak intensity is ascribed to the effect of chlorine on perovskite film growth2735  Furthermore  it was found that the low-angle XRD peak around 141° shifts to a higher two theta value and the peak intensity also increases upon increasing the MACl content  The same as the aforementioned discussion about the HPbI3 ( Cl )  substitution of I– by smaller-size Cl– can also lead to the shrinkage of the crystal lattice of perovskite  which is consistent with the cell parameters variation ( Supplementary Fig  11 )  A slight splitting of the XRD peaks is also observed in the case of the MACl content of 100  in which the large size mismatch between chloride and iodide precludes the formation of a continuous solid phase of MAPbI3−xClx  and results in phase segregation and large cell parameter variation ( Fig  2b and Supplementary Fig  11 )  The observed additional peak around 282 ° is likely associated with the hydrate phase of perovskite38  Fig  2 figure 2 Partial substitution of iodine ions by chorine ions  a  b X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) patterns of MAPbI3 films prepared with different molar ratios of MACl versus HPbI3 in the HPbI3/MACl precursor solution  c UV−Vis spectra

elements from the top to the bottom of the MAPbI3 film prepared with the molar ratio of MACl versus HPbI3 to be 010 in the HPbI3/MACl precursor solution Full size image Although MACl is introduced into precursor with nominal ratios of MACl/HPbI3 from 01 to 1  the remaining contents of chlorine in HPbI3 ( Cl ) and MAPbI3 ( Cl ) can be significantly lower than the nominal content of chlorine in precursor solution  This is due to the fact that MACl tends to sublime at elevated temperatures  Furthermore  chlorine tends to form volatile chlorine-containing species  which also tends to gradually diffuse and sublimate from the film  especially in the presence of water2527  Thus  after thermal annealing in open air ( relative humidity of about 40−60 % ) the remaining chlorine content in the resultant MAPbI3 ( Cl ) films is much lower than the chlorine content in the precursor solution  The low content of chlorine in the MAPbI3 ( Cl ) films is proven by the tiny change in absorption edge ( Fig  2c ) 39  It should be noted that the fluctuation of absorption for the case of MACl content of 070 and 100 may be due to the observed slight phase segregation and large roughness ( Supplementary Fig  12 ) 25273539  Similar to chorine inclusion  phase segregation is also observed in the bromine inclusion case with high content  ie  ( MAPb ( IxBr1−x ) 3 ) ( 01 < x < 08 ) 40  in which perovskite undergo phase separation into iodide-rich and bromide-rich regions under light illumination41  In the case of bromine inclusion with low content  the existence of bromine is found to assist grain growth  improve stability  and device performance404142  To further confirm the existence of chorine in MAPbI3 ( Cl ) films  we employed secondary-ion mass spectrometry ( SIMS ) to characterize the depth profile of chlorine in the perovskite film with MACl content of 01 ( which gives the best device performance as discussed in the device performance section )  As shown in Fig  2d  the Cl depth profile exhibits a continuous and gradual increase  and then shows a significant spatial overlap on the Ti profile  This observation is consistent with other reports revealing that the distribution of chlorine within MAPbI3 ( Cl ) is often inhomogeneous25434445  One possible cause responsible for the inhomogeneous distribution of chlorine is due to the tendency of chlorine to form volatile chlorine-containing species gradually diffusing and sublimating from the top surface of the film  especially in ambient air  resulting in a gradient increase of the Cl content from the film surface to bottom25  Although the XRD results of the MAPbI3 ( Cl ) films do not show obvious peaks of PbCl2 or MAPbCl3  it is worth noting that in addition to incorporation into perovskite  the chlorine may form some chloride compounds that are nondetectable by XRD due to the detection limit or the amorphous nature of these compounds  Here  we can complete the second step of MAPbI3 ( Cl ) formation reaction depicted in Fig  1a as follows : { mathrm { H } } _ { { { 1 - x } } } { mathrm { Pb } } _ { { { 1 - x } } } { mathrm { I } } _ { { { 3 - 4x } } } { mathrm { Cl } } _ { { x } } + { {

} { mathrm { Cl } } _ { { x } }  ( 2 ) where the chlorine-incorporated perovskite  ie  MAPbI3−xClx is termed as MAPbI3 ( Cl ) hereafter  Device performance To study the device performance  we implemented our smooth 11-μm-thick MAPbI3 ( Cl ) films in the device configuration of fluorine-doped tin oxide ( FTO ) /compact TiO2/meso-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au  Supplementary Fig  13 and Supplementary Table 3 show the device performance results  The MACl content of 010 case delivers the best device performance ( Supplementary Note 2 ) with an average current density ( JSC ) of 222 ± 03 mA cm−2  open-circuit voltage ( VOC ) of 109 ± 002 V  fill factor ( FF ) of 0793 ± 0015  and PCE of 191 ± 04 %  As shown in Fig  3a  a best PCE of 200 % was achieved  The integrated JSC from external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) is in excellent agreement with current density–voltage ( J−V ) measurements  with a discrepancy below 2 % ( Fig  3b )  The representative J–V curves under different scan directions indicate the negligible hysteresis effect ( Supplementary Fig  14 )  In addition  a stabilized PCE approaching 19 % for device ( with efficiency of 192 % from J−V measurements ) is also achieved by holding the voltage at the maximum power point for 500 s ( Fig  3c )  which further confirms the negligible hysteresis effect  When compared with reports listed in Supplementary Table 1  the MAPbI3 ( Cl ) -based devices in this work can also deliver a comparable high efficiency with perovskite film thickness over 11 μm as shown in Fig  3d  This suggests that at least the 11-μm-thick MAPbI3 ( Cl ) layer deposited here does not show a detrimental effect in carrier transport  To further inspect the devices  we performed the cross-sectional-view SEM ( Fig  4a )  It is found that the grains extend across the entire absorber layer minimizing grain boundaries and providing facile pathways for efficient charge transport  All these results prove that we obtained high-quality thick perovskite films  and high efficiency PSCs can be fabricated based on these films  Fig  3 figure 3 Photovoltaic performance  a Current density–voltage ( J−V ) curve for the best

perovskite module with an active area of 120 cm2 based on 11-μm-thick MAPbI3 ( Cl ) films Full size image Reproducibility is crucial for mass production of low-cost optoelectronic device applications  When compared with PSCs based on perovskite films fabricated using the antisolvent method  our 11-μm-thick MAPbI3 ( Cl ) film-based devices show significantly improved reproducibility represented by a much smaller PCE standard deviation ( decreasing from ±12 % to ±04 %  Supplementary Fig  15 and Supplementary Table 4 )  The high reproducibility of device performance is attributed to the high reproducibility of 11-μm-thick MAPbI3 ( Cl ) films  To confirm this point  we measured the thickness and roughness of 16 samples of the 11-μm-thick MAPbI3 ( Cl ) films ( Fig  4b  c and Supplementary Figs  16  17 )  The average thickness and roughness together with their standard deviations are determined to be 113 ± 003 μm and 54 ± 04 nm  respectively  In addition  the device performance of 11-μm-thick MAPbI3 ( Cl ) devices is higher than that of the devices based on 450-nm-thick perovskite film deposited by the antisolvent method  The higher efficiency for the former case is mainly due to the improved JSC and FF  which is also supported by the EQE results in Supplementary Fig  15  This improvement is not only due to the thicker film but also its improved film quality  Moreover  a slightly wider spectral response is observed for the 11-μm-thick MAPbI3 ( Cl ) film-based devices  These results suggest that high-quality  thick perovskite films can benefit the enhancement of light harvesting capability  especially at the near-infrared region  towards better device performance  Development of scalable fabrication processes is key to further industrialization of the PSC technology  We demonstrate that our new perovskite formation method is scalable and can be used to fabricate large-area solar modules  Figure 4d shows the optical photograph of 11-μm-thick MAPbI3 ( Cl ) film on 5 cm × 5 cm substrates with the mirror-like smooth surface  It is also found that the film is much more uniform over the entire 5 cm × 5 cm substrate than that of antisolvent case ( Supplementary Figs  18  19 )  We then fabricated six-cell modules ( active area = 120 cm2  geometric fill factor = 48 % ) as shown in Fig  4e  A best active area PCE of 153 % under reverse scan was achieved with a JSC of 366 mA cm−2  VOC of 665 V  and FF of 0630 ( Fig  4f )  which is among the top PCE values obtained for perovskite solar modules with an active area greater than 10 cm2 354647484950515253545556  Furthermore  our new method shows good reproducibility in the large-area device fabrication with an average module PCE and standard deviation of 136 ± 08 % ( Supplementary Table 5 )  which is much better than that of the antisolvent case ( 86 ± 16 %  Supplementary Fig  20 and Supplementary Table 6 )  These results further confirm the excellent reproducibility of our 11-μm-thick MAPbI3 ( Cl ) films on large scale  which is a key advantage for manufacturing in the realistic industrial large-scale setting  Note that small J–V hysteresis was observed for solar modules ( Supplementary Fig  21 )  Charge carrier transport behavior As shown in Fig  3d  we obtained high efficiencies with 11-μm-thick perovskite films  The promising device performance inspired us to conduct systematical investigations of charge transport properties of our PSC devices to find out what factors lead to the high device performance  We first performed conductive atomic force microscopy ( c-AFM ) measurements on the 11-μm-thick MAPbI3 ( Cl ) film and perovskite film prepared by the antisolvent method ( denoted as MAPbI3 ( AS ) )  It was found that the former shows lower roughness ( Supplementary Note 3 ) and rounded large grains with almost four times larger grain size  and its corresponding fewer grain boundaries are expected to reduce the defects density ( Supplementary Fig  22 )  Moreover  the 11-μm-thick MAPbI3 ( Cl ) film also shows nearly an order of magnitude higher light-induced current ( Fig  5a )  which indicates its good electrical conductivity  This observation can be ascribed to the improved crystallinity of the MAPbI3 ( Cl ) films with preferential ( 110 ) orientation ( Fig  5b )  as a result of synergistic effect of CH3NH2 gas1957 and partial substitution of I− by Cl−1112  Fig  5 figure 5 Charge carrier transport behavior  a The light-induced current extracted from the c-AFM results and b XRD spectra for 11-μm-thick MAPbI3 ( Cl )

antisolvent method  Scale bars : 1 μm Full size image In addition to the improvement in terms of the film morphology and conductivity  the defect nature in perovskite films may also play a role in influencing charge carrier transport properties58  To investigate radiative and nonradiative charge carrier recombination channels within perovskite films  we carried out time-resolved photoluminescence ( TRPL ) measurements on glass/perovskite/polymethyl methacrylate ( PMMA ) samples ( Supplementary Fig  23 )  Figure 5c shows the TRPL decay curves obtained from both the glass side and PMMA side for the 11-μm-thick perovskite films with ( MAPbI3 ( Cl ) ) and without ( denoted as MAPbI3 ) chlorine incorporation  Considering the limited penetration depth ( tens of nanometers ) of the light source  the PL emission signal only contains the charge carrier information on the surface layer that is facing the light source59  The time constants ( τ ) are calculated to be 54 ns for the MAPbI3 film no matter whether the laser light incidents from the PMMA side or the glass side  which indicates that perovskite on the bottom and top of film has nearly the same charge carrier properties  In the MAPbI3 ( Cl ) case  the PL lifetime obtained from the glass side is longer than that obtained from the PMMA side  This observation suggests that perovskite on the bottom has better charge carrier properties than the perovskite on the top in MAPbI3 ( Cl ) film  This observation may be correlated with the inhomogeneous distribution of chlorine within MAPbI3 ( Cl ) film  where chlorine within a certain range of concentrations can benefit charge carrier properties  Besides  the MAPbI3 ( Cl ) film shows longer PL lifetimes than that of the MAPbI3 film  This improvement can be ascribed to the better crystallinity and a lower defect density of the MAPbI3 ( Cl ) film60  To quantitatively evaluate the defect density  we fabricated sandwich devices by inserting the perovskite films between FTO and gold  and characterized the evolution of the space-charge-limited current ( SCLC ) for different biases  as shown in Fig  5d−i  In general  the presence of mobile species in perovskite can lead to complication in interpreting the SCLC measurement results  and often precludes a robust quantitative analysis based on such measurements  On the other hand  we observed low hysteresis on the basis of J–V measurements  which indicates a negligible effect of mobile species  Thus  in this case we can safely deduce defects density ( Nt ) within perovskite films based on the SCLC measurements according to the equation1361 : N_ { mathrm { t } } = frac { { 2varepsilon varepsilon _0V_ { { mathrm { TFL } } } } } { { eL^2 } } where ε and ε0 are the dielectric constants of perovskite and the vacuum permittivity  respectively  VTFL is trap-filled limit voltage  L is the thickness of the perovskite films  and e is the elementary charge  We estimated the defect density to be 213×1015 and 251×1015 cm−3 for the 11-μm-thick MAPbI3 ( Cl ) film and MAPbI3 film  respectively  prepared by the HPbI3 ( Cl ) /CH3NH2 method ( Table 1 )  These defect density values are significantly lower than antisolvent case ( 148×1017 cm−3 )  The similar magnitude in terms of defects densities derived from the SCLC measurements in contrast with the clear difference in terms of lifetime derived from PL measurements is possibly due to the fact that the former measurement gives the defect information in the entire films  and the latter measurements only provides the defect information for perovskite on the top or bottom of the film  When the bias voltage further increases in the SCLC curves  the current shows a linear relationship with the square of the voltage  where we can deduce the mobility ( μ ) from the Mott−Gurney law61 : J_ { mathrm { D } } = frac { { 9varepsilon varepsilon _0mu V^2 } } { { 8L^3 } }  The mobility are estimated to be 112 and 083 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the 11-μm-thick MAPbI3 ( Cl ) film and MAPbI3 film  respectively  The much higher carrier conductivity is consistent with the higher device performance of the MAPbI3 ( Cl ) case  which again verifies the positive effect of small content chlorine incorporation on the optoelectronic properties of perovskite films  In addition  these mobility values around 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 are two orders of magnitude higher than that in antisolvent case ( 0014 cm2 V−1 s−1 )  which further confirms the excellent charge carrier transport properties of CH3NH2 gas-based perovskite films  The improved carrier properties of the 11-μm-thick MAPbI3 ( Cl ) films when implemented into PSCs is also verified by impedance spectroscopy characterization of devices under light illumination ( Table 1 Supplementary Fig  24 and Supplementary Note 4 )  Device stability and perovskite film stability Operational stability is another key aspect of PSCs  We studied the stability of the small size devices under the operation conditions ( Fig  6a )  It was found that the 11-μm-thick MAPbI3 ( Cl ) -based devices showed much better stability than the MAPbI3 ( AS ) devices  Especially  the MAPbI3 ( Cl ) devices maintained over 90 % of their initial performance for 800 h under continuous light illumination with maximum power point tracking ( MPPT )  While the PCEs of the MAPbI3 ( AS ) devices decreased to 90 % of their initial performance after approximately 300 h An initial increase of PCEs for both samples is observed in the first 20 h of the stability test  A similar phenomenon was also observed previously5562  and was ascribed to the effects such as elevated temperature ( approximately 46 °C )  light or field induced ion movement  light-induced traps formation  interfacial charge accumulation55  or spiro-OMeTAD conductivity variation63  In addition  both devices showed a fast  exponential decay region after reaching the highest performance points  which is followed by a slower linear decay64  By fitting the linear region  the MAPbI3 ( Cl ) devices exhibit a linear slope of −00014 % h−1  which is 30 % slower than the antisolvent case with a linear slope of −00020 % h−1  Using these slope values  it is expected to take 1660 and 870 h of operation to reach the T80 points for MAPbI3 ( Cl ) devices and the MAPbI3 ( AS ) devices  respectively  The nearly doubled T80 parameters for the MAPbI3 ( Cl ) devices suggests the excellent long-term stability of the cells based on our Cl-incorporated thick films  Note that the stability measurements in this study were conducted under operation conditions  ie  continuous illumination  MPPT  dry N2 gas environment simulating the case of encapsulation  and therefore the results obtained here can be used as a realistic indicator of the device operation lifetime of our PSCs  It should be noted that all of the components in PSCs play an important role in device stability  Considering that MAPbI3 ( Cl ) devices and MAPbI3 ( AS ) devices are assembled using the same device configuration  the impact of charge selective layers and electrode on device stability can be excluded out  Hence  the significant stability difference between MAPbI3 ( Cl ) devices and MAPbI3 ( AS ) devices is most likely caused by the quality of the perovskite films such as crystallinity  grain size and/or defects  etc  132234  Fig  6 figure 6 Device stability and film stability  a Operational stability of un-encapsulated PSCs based on 11 μm thick MAPbI3 ( Cl ) films and perovskite films deposited via the antisolvent method examined under continuous full-sun illumination in dry nitrogen atmosphere  b Factors influence film stability of perovskites Full size image To reveal the underlying mechanism responsible for the improved stability  we prepared four kinds of films  ie  film A : 11 μm MAPbI3 ( Cl ) film prepared by the HPbI3 ( Cl ) /CH3NH2 method ; film B : 11 μm MAPbI3 film by the HPbI3/CH3NH2 method ; film C : 05 μm MAPbI3 ( Cl ) films prepared by the HPbI3 ( Cl ) /CH3NH2 method ; film D : 045 μm MAPbI3 ( AS ) films prepared by the antisolvent method  We tested the stability of these films under light illumination  a high relative humidity of about 100 % and gentle thermal environment of 50 °C ( denoted as LHT ) as shown in Supplementary Fig  25  It is found that that the stability of these four films is in the order film A > film B > film C > film D ( Supplementary Figs  25 to 28 )  The improved stability of film A is firstly attributed to its improved grain crystallinity and larger grain size  which can be clearly seen by comparing the XRD peak intensity and full width half maximum of fresh film A with fresh film D ( Supplementary Fig  28b  c and Supplementary Note 5 )  This is because the ions in highly crystalline perovskite films have higher chemical binding energies to prevent themselves from migrating  which benefits light and thermal stability65  This is confirmed by SEM results shown in Supplementary Fig  29  We found that the decomposition of perovskite mainly started from grain boundaries for all films after 1 h of LTH testing  where H2O and O2 can easily react with perovskite films due to the facts that ( 1 ) chemical binding at grain boundaries with low crystallinity is much weaker than that within crystals and ( 2 ) the severe ion migration in low crystallinity region especially at grain boundaries facilitates degradation ( Fig  6b ) 65  When further comparing film A with film B  film A shows better crystallinity  larger grain size  and also better stability ( Supplementary Figs  26 to 30 )  In addition  better stability of films A and B than thinner films C and D also verifies that thicker films are more advantageous in achieving better stability because the extra top layer of the compact high-quality film in the thicker films naturally helps as a protection layer to protect the film underlying the top layer  Besides  previous reports have demonstrated that often a tiny amount of I2 existing in perovskite films can cause severe degradation of perovskite1366  While  CH3NH2 used here provides an alkaline condition to suppress the formation of I2 during the perovskite formation process and/or reduce the I2 amount during the initial degradation of iodine containing perovskite films ( Fig  6b and Supplementary Fig  28f )  which may contribute to the better stability of films A  B and C than film D1366  Discussion A simple perovskite formation method based on fast reaction of chlorine-incorporated HPbI3 and CH3NH2 has been developed to fabricate high-quality  over 1 μm thick and stable CH3NH3PbI3 ( Cl ) perovskite films in ambient condition  The resultant films can not only enable high efficiencies of 191 ± 04 % ( champion PCE = 200 % ) for small size PSCs and 136 ± 08 % ( champion active area PCE = 153 % ) for 5 cm × 5 cm perovskite solar modules  but also deliver excellent device reproducibility  In addition  the resultant un-encapsulated small size PSCs exhibit an excellent T80 lifetime exceeding 1600 h under continuous light illumination with MPPT in dry N2 environment  The excellent device stability is mainly a result of the excellent films stability  Our study not only provides a highly reproducible method to fabricate PSCs and modules with enhanced efficiency and stability  but also offers the in-depth understanding for the underlying mechanisms responsible for device stability improvement  The encouraging device performance and excellent stability in this work points out to a promising direction  ie  use of thick absorber films to realize PSCs and modules with high efficiency  reproducibility  and stability  Methods Materials All reagents were used as received without further

crystallization method as shown in Supplementary Fig  2  Briefly  11 g PbI2 and 7 g of HI were mixed and dissolved in 17 g of DMF to form an HPbI3 solution  The HPbI3 solution was heated at 100 °C in chlorobenzene vapor environment for 24 h During this heat-treatment  chlorobenzene diffuses into the HPbI3/DMF solution and reduces the solubility of HPbI3  Light yellow needle-like HPbI3 crystals were formed  which were collected and washed with chlorobenzene/DMF ( volume ratio = 3:1 ) for three times and then washed with ethanol for three times  Finally  the HPbI3 crystals were dried at 60 °C for 24 h under vacuum  Fabrication of perovskite films and solar cells To study the dependence of the film thickness on preparation conditions  the HPbI3 films are obtained by spin-coating HPbI3 precursor ( 60 wt % HPbI3 in DMF ) at 5000 rpm for 30 s on substrates under different temperatures ( room temperature  60  70  80  90  100 °C ) in ambient air condition  For chlorine-incorporated perovskite deposition  the precursor solutions containing different molar ratios of MACl/HPbI3 ( 0  005  010  015  020  040  070  100 ) are deposited on substrates preheated at 90 °C at 5000 rpm for 30 s After thermal annealing at 100 °C for 5 min to remove the solvent  part of the MACl and also part or all of the formed HI during this process  the obtained films react with CH3NH2 gas to form perovskite2022  Then the obtained perovskite films are annealed at 100 °C for 5 min in ambient air condition before device fabrication or other characterization  A 30 μL of spiro-OMeTAD was spin coated on the perovskite film at 3000 rpm for 30 s  where a spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene ( 723 mg mL−1 ) solution was employed with the addition of 175 μL Li-TFSI/acetonitrile ( 520 mg mL−1 )  and 288 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine  Finally  a gold layer with a thickness of 100 nm was deposited as the counter electrode on the top of spiro-OMeTAD layer through shadow masks via thermal evaporation under high vacuum ( 5×10−5 Torr )  Characterization Current–voltage ( J–V ) characteristics of PSCs are measured under one sun illumination ( AM 15 G  100 mW cm−2  calibrated using a Newport reference Si-cell  Oriel Instruments Model Number 90026564  2 × 2 cm2 ) using a solar simulator ( Newport Oriel Sol 1A  Xenon-lamp  USHIO  UXL-150SO ) and a Keithley 2400 source meter in ambient air at about 25 oC and a relative humidity of about 40−60 %  The small size PSCs were measured using a 01 cm2 metal mask  No mask is used for measurement of perovskite modules  The active area of perovskite modules is 120 cm2  determined by the overlap areas of top and bottom electrodes described in our previous publication46  All the J−V curves are measured under reverse scan with a scan rate of 025 V s−1 without preconditioning unless otherwise specified  For stability measurements  the cells were subsequently loaded in our home-designed environmental chamber coupled with a solar simulator ( Peccell PEC-L01  AM15G ) and source meter ( Keithley 2401 ) controlled by a LabView program allowing automatic sequential measurements on the devices with adjustable acquisition time intervals  To simulate continuous solar cell operation an active bias voltage was applied to the cells maintaining the solar cell operation at the maximum power point  The devices were kept at the maximum power output voltage during the intervals between consecutive measurements  No UV-filters were used  ie  the UV component is included in illumination  The stability measurement was performed under nitrogen box with a relative humidity below 5 %  EQE measurements were performed on an Oriel IQE 200 in DC mode  SEM measurements was carried out in scanning electron microscope ( Helios NanoLab G3 UC  FEI )  XRD measurements were carried out in a Bruker D8 Discover instrument ( Bruker AXS GmbH  Karlsruhe  Germany ) equipped with Cu wavelength λ = 154 Å X-ray source operated at 1600 W and Goebel mirror  Data were collected from 5 to 60 two theta degrees with a 002 degrees step  Experimental data were fitted to obtain unit cell phase parameters using the Profex/BGMN software ( v3120  http : //profexdoebelinorg/ )  TRPL was acquirEfficient flexible perovskite solar cells and modules were developed using a combination of SnO2 and mesoporous-TiO2 as a fully solution-processed electron transport layer ( ETL )  Cells using such ETLs delivered a maximum power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 148 %  which was 30 % higher than the PCE of cells with only SnO2 as the ETL  The presence of a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold layer over SnO2 led to higher rectification ratios  lower series resistances  and higher shunt resistances  The cells were also evaluated under 200 and 400 lx artificial indoor illumination and found to deliver maximum power densities of 977 μW/cm2 ( estimated PCE of 128 % ) and 192 μW/cm2 ( estimated PCE of 133 % )  respectively  representing the highest values among flexible photovoltaic technologies reported so far  Furthermore  for the first time  a fully laser-patterned flexible perovskite module was fabricated using a complete three-step laser scribing procedure ( P1  P2  P3 ) with a PCE of 88 % over an active area of 12 cm2 under an illumination of 1 suned using the time-correlated  single-photon counting technique ( Hamamatsu  C10627 )  and excitation was provided by a femtosecond mode-locked Ti : sapphire laser ( Spectra-Physics  MAITAI XF-IMW ) at 450 nm with an average power at 8 MHz of 074 mW  In TRPL  perovskite films were covered with PMMA on the top of the perovskite layer to exclude/minimize the influence of ambient air ( especially the influence from H2O and O2 ) 67686970  SIMS ( Kratos Axis ULTRA ) equipped with quadrupole

diameter of 100 µm were utilized  The beam was set at an angle of 45° with respect to the sample surface normal  The spectrometer was operated at a pressure of 10−8 Torr  The c-AFM measurement of the films was performed in contact-mode ( MFP-3D series  Asylum Research ) in ambient conditions ( 35 % RH  22 °C )  Top side illumination was generated with a halogen lamp  Chromium/platinum-coated cantilevers with a nominal spring constant of 02 N m−1 were used to collect the photo-generated currents  The SCLC data were collected with a semiconductor characterization system in N2 ( 4200-SCS

Introduction Perovskite solar cells  with a rapid increase in their efficiency  have emerged as highly promising candidates for the next-generation photovoltaic era [ 12345678910 ]  Various methods have been developed to produce high-quality perovskite layers  Among them  vacuum deposition has advantages such as avoiding the use of toxic solvents  ability to control thickness  and potential possibility of large-scale production  compared to the solution process [ 101112131415161718192021222324 ]  For organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite  however  the non-directionality of organic vapor due to high vapor pressure and low molecular mass leads to poor controllability for co-evaporation [ 6  252627 ]  On the other hand  stability as well as efficiency is important for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells  Recently  all-inorganic Cs-based perovskite has attracted attention owing to its better thermal stability than hybrid perovskite ; this also provides a processing advantage for co-evaporation because organic materials are not used [ 6  272829303132333435 ]  Here  we prepared all-inorganic perovskite CsPbI2Br by the co-evaporation of CsBr and PbI2  Vacuum deposition produced uniform and compact perovskite layers over the entire substrate area  Planar heterojunction solar cells were fabricated using TiO2 and 22′77′-tetrakis- ( n  n-di-4-methoxyphenylamino ) -99′-spirobifluorene ( spiro-OMeTAD ) charge-transporting layers in the regular n-i-p form  2 Experimental Procedure 21 Device Fabrication Fluorine-doped tin oxide ( FTO ) -coated glass substrates were washed in an ultrasonic cleaner sequentially using acetone  methanol  isopropyl alcohol  and deionized water  The substrates were then exposed to ultraviolet-ozone for 15 min to improve wettability  For compact TiO2 as electron transport layers  045 and 06 M of titanium diisopropoxidebis ( Sigma-Aldrich ) in n-butanol were spin-coated twice at 2500 rpm for 20 s The samples were then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min in a furnace  To obtain perovskite layers  CsBr ( 99999 %  Sigma-Aldrich ) and PbI2 ( 99 %  Sigma-Aldrich ) powders were co-evaporated from two independently heated crucibles on the TiO2-coated substrates  Subsequently  the thin films were annealed at 300 °C for 1 min  For hole transport layers  Spiro-OMeTAD ( 99 %  Sigma-Aldrich ) in chlorobenzene were mixed with lithium bis ( trifluoromethylsyfonyl ) imide ( 9995 %  Sigma-Aldrich ) salt and tert-butylpyridine ( Sigma-Aldrich ) in acetonitrile  This precursor solutions were spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 40 s  and then maintained in air for 12 h for oxidation  Au electrodes were deposited by thermal evaporation  22 Characterization Optical absorbance spectra were measured using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer ( UV-1601PC : SHIMADZU )  The morphology of the perovskite film was investigated by a field emission scanning electron microscopy ( FE-SEM  S-4300 : HITACHI )  The photocurrent density–voltage ( J–V ) characteristics of the perovskite solar cells were analyzed using a solar simulator ( 94021A : NEWPORT )  During the measurements  the solar cell devices were masked with an aperture area of 009 cm2  3 Result and Discussion The fabrication process for the perovskite CsPbI2Br layers is schematically represented in Fig  1a  For stoichiometric composition  the samples were fabricated by varying the evaporation temperatures of the individual sources  As a result  the evaporation temperatures ( evaporation rates ) for CsBr and PbI2 were determined to be 605 °C ( 088 Å/s ) and 320 °C ( 124 Å/s )  respectively  and the deposition time was 27 min  After deposition  the thin films were post-annealed to form a high-crystallinity perovskite phase  Figure 1b is a photograph of the optimized CsPbI2Br thin film  which is brown in color  Figure 1c shows the UV–Vis absorption spectrum and corresponding Tauc plot of the perovskite thin film  The bandgap value estimated by the Tauc plot is 197 eV  demonstrating the successful formation of the perovskite CsPbI2Br thin film [ 28 ]  Fig  1 figure 1 a Schematic illustration of the fabrication process for

microstructures of the perovskite layers were then observed by SEM  Figure 2a is the low-magnification image of the perovskite layer showing homogeneous and dense characteristics  In the high-magnification image ( Fig  2b )  closely packed grains with complete coverage are seen  Figure 2c is the cross-sectional image  showing the distinct and continuous growth morphology of the perovskite layer  The film thickness was ~ 400 nm  and the average grain size was estimated to ~ 250 nm by Gaussian-fitting the histogram  as shown in Fig  2d  Fig  2 figure 2 SEM analyses of the perovskite layer  a Low-magnification image  b High-magnification image  c Cross-sectional view  d Histogram showing the grain size distribution Full size image Figure 3a shows the device scheme of the fabricated n-i-p type perovskite solar cells  The J–V curve and photovoltaic parameters of the champion cell are presented in Fig  3b  The CsPbI2Br solar cell showed a best photoconversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 57 %  with a short-circuit current density ( Jsc ) of 109 mA/cm2  an open circuit voltage ( Voc ) of 11 V  and a fill factor ( FF ) of 049  Although we tried to make stoichiometric composition by controlling the evaporation rates of the individual sources during co-evaporation  there is a possibility that the thin films having an exact composition ratio ( like solution process ) could not be formed  Inexact stoichiometry can induce inactive second phases  tiny pinholes with perovskite formation  etc  which is regarded as the main reason for low device efficiency  Figure 3c shows the result of the thermal stability evaluation that was performed at 85 °C under atmosphere ( humidity : ~ 30 % )  and the cell maintained ~ 85 % of its initial efficiency

atmosphereRecently  all-inorganic perovskite quantum dots ( QDs ) ( CsPbX3  X = Cl  Br  I ) as the emerging semiconductor materials have been intensively studied owing to superior optical properties  Currently  the strategy for preparation of inorganic perovskite QDs mainly focuses on the hot-injection method  but requires inert gas protection and is difficult to mass-produce  In this work  we developed a simple and low-cost strategy for preparing highly luminescent and air-stable all-inorganic perovskite QDs by directly heating perovskite precursors in octane in air  The emission wavelength of CsPbX3 perovskite QDs can be tunable from ultraviolet ( UV ) to infrared region by simply controlling their halide composition and display high PLQYs  Moreover  CsPbX3 perovskite QDs in octane can exist more than half a year in air and the film of CsPbX3 perovskite QDs also shows good thermal stability and air stability  especially high iodide-substituted CsPbBr3−xIx perovskite QDs  The CsPbX3 perovskite QDs can be easily blended with PDMS and used as color conversion layer on the blue LEDs chip for high-quality white LEDs  Our work opens a window for the potential application of such highly luminescent material in the fields of multicolor LEDs  backlight display and other related optoelectronic devices  Similar content being viewed by others Advances in the Application of

Hole Transport Layer for Hysteresis-Free Colloidal Quantum Dot Solar Cells Article 10 February 2024 Introduction White light-emitting diodes ( LEDs ) as solid-state light sources have aroused much attention in the fields of lighting and backlit down converters for liquid crystal displays because of their cheapness  long working life  environmentally friendly and energy conservation characteristics [ 123 ]  Presently  commercial white LEDs are usually consisted of blue GaN-based chips and yellow YAG : Ce3+ phosphors or other nitride phosphors [ 4  5 ]  Nevertheless  excited yellow phosphors usually generate the low color-rendering index ( CRI ) and the relatively high color temperature ( CCT )  making them difficult to meet the demand for high-quality white LEDs [ 6 ]  Therefore  obtaining a green luminescent phosphor with PLQYs  narrow emission and low cost still faces great challenges  Recently  all-inorganic CsPbX3 ( X = I  Br  Cl ) perovskite quantum dots ( QDs ) due to the high photoluminescence quantum yields ( PLQYs  above 90 % )  narrow emission  tunable wavelength and short radiative lifetimes have received much attention [ 78910 ]  As a new type of promising optoelectronic materials  they are expected to have broad applications in electroluminescent ( EL ) diodes [ 11121314151617 ]  lasers [ 18 ]  photodetectors [ 19  20 ]  scintillator [ 21 ] and backlit displays [ 22 ]  Furthermore  all-inorganic CsPbX3 perovskite QDs can be synthesized with much lower temperatures and simpler processes in comparison with classical inorganic nanocrystals or QDs [ 23 ]  These advantages endow CsPbX3 QDs as an emerging luminescent material for multicolor display and white LEDs [ 24  25 ]  Despite the merits of perovskite NCs  the inherent instability and poor reliability of perovskite QDs seriously impede practical applications  which bring a great challenge to commercialization  A lot of efforts have been devoted to improve the stability of perovskite QDs via embedding perovskite QDs into organic or inorganic matrix or surface coatings  For example  Wang group reported that encapsulation of all-inorganic perovskite quantum dots into a mesoporous metal–organic framework provides enhanced stability for optoelectronic devices [ 26 ]  Ren et al  synthesized CsPbX3 ( X = Br  I ) PeQDs/ERGO films by encapsulation of PeQDs within Ergo® optical adhesive 8500 and exhibited great water resistance and air stability [ 27 ]  Liu et al  reported that composites of perovskite CsPbX3-embedded mesoporous silica particles showed enhanced stability [ 22 ]  Currently  a series of synthetic strategies  such as hot injection [ 9 ]  supersaturated recrystallization [ 28 ]  microwave reaction [ 29 ]  and ultrasonication [ 30 ]  have been developed to prepare CsPbX3 perovskite QDs  However  these methods face different challenges in the preparation of CsPbX3 QDs  For example  the hot-injection method often needs inert gas protection to complete the whole reaction process and reaction temperature is relatively high  Supersaturated recrystallization to prepare the high iodide-substituted CsPbBr3−xIx PQDs ( 2 ≤ x ≤ 3 ) still faces great challenge because of their poor stability in air  In addition  toxic solvents such as toluene or chloroform are often required during the reaction process  Moreover  hot injection is not suitable for large-scale preparation of CsPbX3 QDs because of their expensive  labor intensive and time-consuming [ 31 ]  Therefore  it is highly desirable to find a new method that aims to produce high-quality and highly luminescent CsPbX3 QDs for potential applications in the multicolor LEDs and white LEDs  Non-injection or heating method  where all reagents are placed in a reactor at room temperature and then heated to the desired reaction temperature to prepare NCs  is a promising method for large-scale preparation because it does not require a precursor injection  This method has been widely used to prepare metal oxides [ 32 ]  noble metal [ 33 ] and semiconductor [ 343536 ] nanocrystals  In this paper  the multicolored  air-stable perovskite CsPbX3 ( X = Cl  Br  I ) QDs were synthesized through a one-pot strategy by directly heating perovskite precursors in octane in air  The emission wavelength of CsPbX3 perovskite QDs can be tunable from ultraviolet ( UV ) to infrared region and display high PLQYs  Moreover  the films of CsPbX3 perovskite QDs show good thermal stability and air stability  especially high iodide-substituted CsPbBr3−xIx QDs  Finally  the high performance of white LEDs and beautiful multicolor patterns was also achieved by using various colored CsPbX3 perovskite QDs/PDMS ink as color conversion layer  Experimental section Materials All reagents were here used without further purification : lead chloride ( PbCl2  99999 % metals basis )  lead bromide ( PbBr2  99999 % metals basis )  lead iodide ( PbI2  9999 % metals basis )  cesium carbonate ( Cs2CO3  9999 % metals basis )  oleylamine ( OAm  80–90 % )  oleic acid ( OA  analytical grade )  trioctylphosphine ( TOP  90 % )  octane [ > 99 % ( GC ) ] were bought from Shanghai Aladdin Reagent Co Ltd PDMS comes from Dow Corning 184 optical adhesives ; it includes the basic components and curing agent  Preparation of CsPbX3 perovskite QDs CsPbX3 ( X = Cl  Br  I ) perovskite QDs were fabricated via a one-pot strategy by directly heating perovskite precursors in octane in air  Firstly  Cs precursors were obtained by mixing 06 mmol ( 1955 mg ) Cs2CO3 powder  30 mL of octane and 15 mL of OA together in a 100-mL stand-up flask and heating the mixture to 90 °C in a heating agitator until all the Cs2CO3 powder was dissolved  The Pb precursors were obtained by mixing 18 mmol PbX2 powder  30 mL of octane  15 mL of OA and 3 mL of OAm together in a 100-mL stand-up flask  and heating the mixture to 90 °C in a heating agitator until all the PbX2 powder was dissolved  The preparation of PbCl2 precursor solution requires adding 3 mL of TOP  Typically  for the synthesis of CsPbBr3 QDs  30 mL Cs precursors and 30 mL PbBr2 precursors were mixed together  then heated to 80 °C in a heating agitator for 12–20 min and cooled by ice-water bath  Other CsPbClxBr3−x or CsPbBr3−xIx ( 0 < x < 3 ) perovskite QDs were obtained with a similar method through simply blending lead halide precursor solution with an appropriate ratio  For example  CsPbBr15Cl15 QDs  30 mL Cs precursors  15 mL PbBr2 precursors and 15 mL PbCl2 precursors were mixed together ; 30 mL Cs precursors  10 mL PbBr2 precursors and 20 mL PbI2 precursors were mixed for the preparation of CsPbBrI2 QDs  The initial solution was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 min to precipitate the large particles  and the supernatant was retained for subsequent use  CsPbX3 QDs/PDMS ink and white LEDs For the preparation of perovskite QDs/PDMS composite  the ethyl acetate was added into the supernatant solution with a volume ratio of 2:1 ; the precipitate was collected after centrifugation and dispersed into curing agent under stirring for 8 h Next  the basic components were added into the above solution with weight ratio of 10:1  The concentration is about 100 mg/mL and then heated to 60 °C for 10 h in a vacuum oven to form CsPbX3 QDs/PDMS film  The white LEDs were consisted of a 460-nm blue-emitting chip  517-nm green-emitting CsPbBr3 QDs/PDMS layer and 643-nm red-emitting CsPbBrI2 QDs/PDMS layer  respectively  Characterizations The structures and morphologies of the CsPbBr3 QDs were characterized using XRD ( Bruker D8 Advanced diffractometer with CuKα radiation )  SEM ( SU8020 ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM  F20 )  UV–Vis absorption was tested by using a Lambda950 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer  and PL spectrums were measured using a confocal micro-Raman system ( HORIBA/LabRAM HR Evolution )  The PLQYs were measured by a fluorescence spectrometer with an integrated sphere excited by a 405-nm laser  The PL decay curves were measured with an all-functional steady-state/transient fluorescence spectrometer ( EI/FLS980-S2S2-stm )  The EL spectrums of white LEDs were collected using an integrating sphere with an analyzer system ( PR705 spectrometer )  Results and discussion Highly luminescent and air-stable CsPbX3 perovskite QDs have been fabricated by simply mixing Cs  PbX2 precursors in octane in air  In the reaction process  the reaction temperature and time are very key parameters for controlling the emission wavelength and morphology of CsPbX3 perovskite QDs  Take the CsPbBr3 perovskite QDs as an example  Fig  1 presents the PL intensity of CsPbBr3 perovskite QDs with various reaction times at different temperatures  At low temperatures ( below 60 °C )  the PL spectrum of the sample remained almost unchanged although the reaction time is long enough  This is because the perovskite CsPbBr3 is in the nucleation state and grows very slowly  As the reaction temperature is up to 100 °C ( the boiling point of octane is about 125 °C )  the CsPbX3 seed grows fast and the emission peak is not easy to control  In addition  the PL spectrum is broadened due to uneven size of nanocrystals at high temperature  as shown in Fig  1c  All in all  the emission wavelength of CsPbBr3 can be tuned by controlling the temperature at the same time interval  as shown in Fig  1d  Correspondingly  the emission wavelength of CsPbBr3 can be tunable from 434 to 525 nm  and the emitting colors of CsPbBr3 QDs in octane range from dark blue to green ( see the inset of Fig  1d )  To get more information about nanocrystal nucleation and growth kinetics  samples were taken from the reaction vessel at various reaction stages and the ex situ PL spectra were measured  At an early stage  the corresponding metal–oleic acid complex and Br-ion release subsequently react to thereby nucleate the CsPbBr3 seed  as indicated by enhanced redshift emission in the range of 4–16 min  During the final reaction stage ( > 16 min )  the PL emission of the colloidal solution red shifted to ~ 517 nm and slightly changed in intensity  indicating that the CsPbX3 seed has grown to form CsPbX3 QDs ( see Fig  2a )  According to the analysis  the nucleation and growth of CsPbX3 NCs in octane are very similar to the nucleation and growth of CsPbX3 NCs in ODE [ 37 ]  The below part of Fig  2a shows an optical photograph of CsPbBr3 QDs in octane under a 380-nm UV lamp irradiation with various reaction times  The clear solution begins to turn gray white and blue emission is observed  After 16 min  a bright green emission was presented  The color change of the solution under UV light with different reaction times is consistent with the changes of their CIE color coordinates ( see Fig  2b )  Correspondingly  the emission wavelength of CsPbBr3 can be tunable from 468 to 532 nm by controlling the reaction time ( see Fig  2b )  At the same time  the average diameters of CsPbBr3 QDs increase from 4 to 30 nm ( see Fig  2c–e )  which is the proof of quantization [ 38 ]  Therefore  the proposed method for synthesizing CsPbX3 NCs can be divided into three parts : metal–oleic acid complex and X-ion release  CsPbX3 seed nucleation and CsPbX3 NC growth  Figure 1 figure 1 PL intensity of CsPbBr3 QDs with various reaction times at the temperature

pattern ( XRD ) of CsPbBr3 perovskite QDs is shown in Fig  3a  in which the characteristic peaks at 2θ = 151°  214°  305°  339°  377° and 435°  respectively  correspond to the reflections from ( 100 )  ( 110 )  ( 200 )  ( 210 )  ( 211 ) and ( 202 ) crystal planes of cubic phase structure of CsPbBr3 ( PDF # 540752 ) [ 11 ]  The morphologies of CsPbBr3 perovskite QDs on ITO glass substrate show a compact nanoparticles film from the results of scanning electron microscope ( SEM  see Fig  3b )  The insets are the digital images of CsPbBr3 perovskite QDs film under natural light and 380 nm UV light  Figure 3c and inset show typical transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) images and high-resolution TEM images of CsPbBr3 perovskite QDs  The diameter of CsPbBr3 QDs is observed ranging from 6 to 10 nm  and the high-resolution TEM results show that the lattice space is 0296 nm  corresponding to the ( 200 ) plane of CsPbBr3 QDs  which is in good agreement with other previously reported data [ 11 ]  In addition  the optical properties of the CsPbBr3 QDs were measured by ultraviolet–visible absorption and PL spectrums  and an obvious excitonic absorption peak presents at 509 nm  which is similar to other observations [ 39  40 ]  The PL spectra of the CsPbBr3 QDs show a green emission ( ~ 517 nm ) with a line width of 181 nm  The small Stokes shift suggests that the PL emission of CsPbBr3 QDs originates from the bound exciton-related recombination [ 22 ]  To get more information about the exciton recombination dynamics  the time-resolved PL spectra were measured  as shown in Fig  3e  The decay curve can be well-fitted with a biexponential function : I ( t ) = A_ { 1 } exp left ( { frac { - t } { { tau_ { 1 } } } } right ) + A_ { 2 } exp left ( { frac { - t } { { tau_ { 2 } } } } right ) [ 41  42 ]  The obtained CsPbBr3 QDs exhibit a short-lived lifetime of 66 ns ( τ1 ) with a percentage of 66 % assigning to the radiative recombination of the electron–hole pairs and the long-lived lifetime of 285 ns ( τ2 ) with a percentage of 34 % correlating with the surface state-related non-radiative recombination [ 43 ]  The average lifetime of CsPbBr3 QDs is 218 ns  which is larger than that of the methylammonium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals [ 39  44 ]  Compared with the PL peak ( 525 nm ) and lifetime ( 298 ns ) of CsPbBr3 nanosheets [ 15 ]  we found that the PL peak appears redshift and the lifetime becomes longer with the size of CsPbBr3 increasing  The temperature-dependent PL spectra of typical CsPbBr3 QDs film were measured to get more information about excitonic emission behavior  as shown in Fig  4a  As the temperatures increase  the PL intensity of CsPbBr3 QDs displays a decreasing trend and is also accompanied with a continuous blueshift of the emission peak  These blueshift phenomena are also observed from previously reported CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 QDs [ 12  40 ]  This blueshift phenomenon is uncommon and may be related to thermal expansion and electron–phonon renormalization of the crystal lattice during heating [ 45 ]  The empirical Varshni relation was used to describe the temperature-dependent band gap of semiconductors  as shown in the following equation [ 46 ] : E_ { { text { gap } } } = E_ { { text { gap } 0 { text { K } } } } - alpha T^ { 2 } / ( beta + T ) ( 1 ) Here  α is the coefficient of change and β is the Debye temperature for the material  For CsPbBr3 QDs  the values of α ranges from ( 13 to 19 ) × 10−4 K−2 and β value from the Varshni relation is close to zero [ 47 ]  Therefore  as the temperatures increase  the PL peak of CsPbBr3 QDs displays a continuous blueshift phenomenon  Considering that no structural phase transition is observed in the studied temperature region  the exciton binding energy is extracted by plotting the relationship between the integral PL intensity and the measured temperature  as shown in Fig  4b  The integrated PL intensity decreases exponentially with increasing temperature  and exciton binding energy of CsPbBr3 QDs can be deduced with the following equation [ 11  48 ] : I ( T ) = frac { { I_ { 0 } } } { { 1 + Ae^ { { - E_ { B } / ( k_ { text { B } } T ) } } } } ( 2 ) in which I0 is the emission intensity at 0 K  and A is the proportionality constant  k_ { text { B } } is the Boltzmann constant and EB is the exciton binding energy of CsPbBr3 QDs  The best-fitting curve gives the value of EB as 42 ± 36 meV  which is close to the previously reported values [ 11  12 ]  Theoretically  the relatively high EB of CsPbBr3 QDs ensures that excitons can be able to survive above room temperature and their high rate recombination  highlighting their potential applications in LEDs  laser diodes and other exciton-related optoelectronic devices  Moreover  a detailed analysis temperature dependence of PL line width broadening behavior can provide the information of exciton–phonon coupling in QDs  which also strongly affects the emission of excitonic PL ( see Fig  4c )  The temperature-dependent FWHM of PL emissions for CsPbBr3 QDs was fitted by adapting the independent Boson model to obtain optical phonon energy [ 49  50 ] : varGamma ( T ) = varGamma_ { 0 } + sigma T + varGamma_ { op } / ( exp ( hbar omega_ { op } /KT ) - 1 ) ( 3 ) Here  varGamma_ { 0 } is the inhomogeneous broadening contribution  sigma and varGamma_ { op } describe the interactions of exciton–acoustic phonon and exciton–optical phonon contributions to the line width broadening  respectively  and hbar omega_ { op } is the optical phonon energy  From the equation  we can see that the first term varGamma_ { 0 } is the main contribution factor to varGamma ( T ) at low temperature  And at relatively high temperature  the contributions from acoustic and optical phonons dominate over that of varGamma ( T )  In the case that the energies of varGamma_ { 0 }  varGamma_ { op } and hbar omega_ { op } in CsPbBr3 QDs are almost independent of temperature  their constant values are obtained  respectively  The optical phonon energy is calculated to be 326 ± 26 meV  implying strong exciton–phonon interaction  which is in good agreement with the desired thermal anti-quenching action of CsPbBr3 QDs  There is no phase change over the entire temperature measurement range ( see Fig  4d ) and so the operation of CsPbX3 QD-related devices can be expected to work under harsh environments  Figure 3 figure 3 a XRD pattern of CsPbBr3 QDs film  b SEM images of CsPbBr3 QDs film ; the insets are digital images of CsPbBr3 QDs film under sunlight and a 380-nm

by simply blending PbX2 salts in octane precursors using this non-injection strategy in air  The PL spectra and UV–Vis absorption of the obtained CsPbX3 perovskite QDs with various halide compositions display a single peak with a narrow emission  as shown in Fig  5a  b  The emission peaks in the PL spectra changed from 416 to 671 nm as a function of halide components  Corresponding to the PL spectra  the absorption spectra show that more Br-ion-substituted I-ions or more Cl-ion-substituted Br-ions result in the band edges in the absorption spectra blueshifted  Meanwhile  the full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) of PL spectra ranges from 16 to 40 nm ( see Fig  5c and Table 1 )  which is little smaller than those of MAPbX3 QDs [ 40 ] and the band gap linearly shifts for different Br/I and Cl/Br ratio samples conformed by Vegard ’ s law [ 51 ] ( see Fig  5c )  The digital images of these CsPbX3 perovskite QDs solution in octane under natural light and a 380-nm UV light are shown in Fig  5d  which emitted color covering the whole visible light region  The PLQY of the CsPbBr3 perovskite QDs was approximately 89 % ; it can be comparable to that of the organometal halide perovskite amorphous nanoparticles or previously reported CsPbBr3 nanocrystals [ 9  44 ]  In comparison  the Cl- or I-substituted CsPbX3 perovskite QDs show much lower PLQYs  but the PLQYs of blue and red CsPbX3 perovskite QDs still keep more than 60 % ( see Table 1 )  Figure 5 figure 5 Optical properties of CsPbX3 perovskite QDs  The PL spectra ( a ) and optical absorption spectra ( b ) of CsPbX3 perovskite

perovskite quantum dots dispersed in PDMS ( CsPbX3 QDs/PDMS ) as ink to realize multicolor ink painting  as shown in Fig  6a  Compared with the photographs of multicolor patterns under natural light  the photographs of multicolor patterns under 380-nm UV light show more beauty and vividness  This phenomenon is mainly attributed to the high quantum efficiency and narrow emission of CsPbX3 perovskite quantum dots  For example  the emission wavelength and FWHM of blue ( CsPbCl15Br15 )  green ( CsPbBr3 ) and red QDs ( CsPbBrI2 ) are located in 462 nm ( 165 nm )  517 nm ( 181 nm ) and 643 nm ( 32 nm )  respectively  as shown in Fig  6b  Moreover  the Commission International de L ’ Eclarage ( CIE ) color coordinates values of CsPbCl15Br15 QDs ( 015  0063 )  CsPbBr3 QDs ( 012  074 ) and CsPbBrI2 QDs ( 069  030 ) cover a much larger area than that of the traditional National Television Systems Committee ( NTSC ) standard ( see Fig  6c )  The chromaticity of CsPbX3 perovskite QDs is comparable to the reported cadmium-based QDs-LEDs or organometal halide perovskites QDs [ 43  52 ]  Although the perovskite QDs have superior optoelectronic properties  they are still affected by moisture  heat and continuous light illumination  called chemical and optical stability  Our obtained inorganic perovskite QDs films show relatively good photo-stability and thermal stability  as shown in Fig  7a  b  The relative PL intensity tends to decrease with increasing the time of UV irradiation ( 365 nm  6 W lamp ) or temperature  but their relative PL intensity still remains at around 70 % after 40 h of UV irradiation or 80 °C heating  As shown in the inset of Fig  7b  even at high temperature of 80 °C  the blue  green and red perovskite QDs film still keeps good luminescent characteristic  Moreover  the CsPbX3 QDs/PDMS film has good moisture resistant  as shown in Fig  7c  d ; even after soaking in water for 10 h  it still emits very bright fluorescence  In addition  this method can be readily large-scale synthesizing CsPbX3 perovskite for potential commercial application  To verify the extensibility of our proposed method  the amounts of reagents were increased to four times in 250-mL three-necked flask  as shown in Fig  8a–c  A concept experiment of white LED was proposed to demonstrate the application of CsPbX3 QDs/PDMS composites in lighting  The white LED was consisted of a GaN-based blue chip ( 460 nm )  green-emitting CsPbBr3 QDs/PDMS layer and red-emitting CsPbBrI2 QDs/PDMS layer  as shown in Fig  8d  The optimized devices have a luminous efficacy of 403 lm W−1 at a current density of 15 mA with coordinate value of ( 032  033 ) and bright pure white light ( see the inset of Fig  8e )  Electroluminescence ( EL ) spectrums show a blue emission wavelength of GaN-based chip  a green emission wavelength belonged to CsPbBr3 QDs and a red emission wavelength resulted from CsPbBrI2 QDs  as shown in Fig  8e  Under continuous eight-hour working  the EL spectra do not change much  indicating that the device has a reasonable stability  All the results demonstrate that the stability of CsPbX3 QD/PDMS has been improved and CsPbX3 QDs/PDMS composite film as luminescent materials has a great potential application in solid-state lighting system  Figure 6 figure 6 a Photographs of multicolor patterns with blue  green and red

efficiency of solar cells approaching Shockley-Queisser limit  However  it lacks a general strategy to control the precursor chemistry for defects density reduction in the family of iodine based perovskite  Here the alkaline environment in precursor solution is carefully investigated as an effective parameter to suppress the incident iodine and affects the crystallization kinetics during film fabrication  via rationale adjustment of the alkalinity of additives  Especially  a ‘ residual free ’ weak alkaline is proposed not only to shrink the bandgap of the absorber by modulating the stoichiometry of organic cation  but also to improve the open circuit voltage in the resultant device  Consequently  the certified efficiency of 2087 % ( Newport ) is achieved with one of the smallest voltage deficits of 413 mV in the planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell  Similar content being viewed by others Defects in perovskite-halides and their effects in solar cells Article 31 October 2016 Surface passivation of perovskite film for efficient solar cells Article 01 April 2019 Defects engineering for high-performance perovskite solar cells Article Open access 14 August 2018 Introduction Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have attracted broad attention1  owing to their low fabrication cost and intriguing optical and electronic properties2345  Impressively  it witnessed the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of perovskite solar cells boosted from 38 % 6 to a certified 237 % rapidly78910  To enable a truly competitive PCE of perovskite solar cells as that of the most efficient inorganic counterpart  eg  GaAs  it is required to further reduce their energy loss  This relies on the improved charge generation and mitigated non-radiative charge recombination within the complete device  With careful investigations on the absorber materials1112  device configuration1314  and relevant interfaces1516  it is found that the intrinsic defect properties1718 in perovskite films influence the charge dynamics in the devices significantly  Halide perovskites are generally regarded as relatively soft ionic solids  which are prone to contain point defects319 in polycrystalline films ( eg  vacancies  interstitials  and cation and anti-site substitutions )  They often serve as the non-radiative recombination centers to affect the quantum efficiency of photoluminescence and deteriorate the photovoltaic performance1720  Therefore  to assure the best power output by reducing energy and voltage loss  it is of great importance to gain profound understanding on the defect physics and chemistry  which results in defects elimination in perovskite films for efficient photo-carrier transport  During the past few years  efforts have been attempted to probe the defects to unveil their nature  In the methylammonium lead iodide ( MAPbI3 ) perovskite  it reported a variety of shallow native point defects  eg  Pb vacancies ( VPb )  MA vacancies ( VMA )  interstitials MA ( MAi )  etc3  and deep energy-level defects2 in forms of complex and derivatives  such as interstitials I ( Ii ) and its derivatives2122  In mixed perovskites  it reveals even more complicated defect physics  wherein formamidinium ( FA ) -related defect IFA ( the complexes of Ii and VFA ) makes a transition at a Fermi level that sits deep within the bandgap19  Furthermore  defect formation is reported to be correlated to the processing conditions  wherein films grown under iodine-rich conditions exhibit a higher defect density23  Among all defects  iodine-related defects receive most interest  It is reported that polyiodide complexes in dimethylformamide ( DMF ) solution could easily induce defects due to a nonstoichiometric Pb/I ratio in the resultant films24  When dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) was further introduced  either I-rich or I-deficient intermediates were identified  depending on the ratio of the starting materials25  Recently  it demonstrated iodine redox chemistry to convert hole traps into electron traps possibly by oxidation during film processing26  Subsequently  the iodide management was proposed to effectively decrease the concentration of mid-gap defects in the perovskite films  and improve the PCEs of perovskite solar cells272829  Yet  it lacks a feasible approach to be universally adopted in various halide perovskites  which suppresses the incidental I2 in the absorber for enhanced device performance with reduced energy and voltage loss  In this work  we demonstrate a universal technique to suppress the incident I2 in the halide precursor solution by employing alkaline  wherein iodine can be effectively eliminated via a disproportionation reaction under a number of different alkaline environments  The alkalinity is further demonstrated to affect the crystallization kinetics and optoelectronic properties of perovskite films  For instance  formamidine acetate as a ‘ residual free ’ weak alkaline  is found to effectively manipulate the stoichiometry of the cations in the mixed perovskite ( ( FA  MA  Cs ) Pb ( I  Br ) 3 ) precursor  and in particular to reduce the density of deep-level defects in the resultant films substantially  Consequently  the corresponding mixed perovskite solar cells achieve an average PCE of 2087 % ( certified )  More interestingly  this modified absorber possesses a smaller bandgap  but the resultant device revealed unambiguous improvement in the open-circuit voltage ( VOC )  corresponding to a VOC deficit of 413 mV  which is one of the smallest certified value in the planar perovskite solar cells  These findings provide a universal approach for defect reduction in iodide-based perovskite films  which substantially reduce the energy and voltage loss to boost the efficiency of the devices  Results Suppression of I2 impurity via alkaline additives Precise control of precursor solutions is crucial for perovskite film deposition  Generally  the organic precursors are hygroscopic and unstable in air or under illumination  In particular  formamidine iodide ( FAI ) and methylammonium iodide ( MAI ) can be easily oxidized to form I2 and/or other by-products  which induces the nonstoichiometric ratio in the precursor solution  It further leads to defect states in perovskite films that eventually deteriorate device performance  The degradation mechanism involves the formation of I2  which is thoroughly studied in previous work30  Ultraviolet-visible ( UV-vis ) absorption spectroscopy was conducted to semiquantitatively investigate the formation of iodide species in the precursor solution27282931  As shown in Fig  1a  the organic cation solution used to prepare the perovskite films shows a characteristic peak at 360 nm  It is often attributed to the absorption of I3−  stemmed from I− reacting reversibly with I2  Interestingly  the peak intensity equals to that of 10−4 M I2 in isopropanol  indicating the trace amount of I2 in the organic cation precursor solution  Fig  1 figure 1 Suppression of I2 impurity via alkaline additives  UV-vis absorption spectra of the organic cation solution  which is used to prepare the perovskite films  with different amounts of ( a ) FAAc  ( b ) CH3COONa  ( c ) NaHCO3  ( d ) NaOH  and ( e ) KOH ethanol solution  f Normalized absorbance for organic cation solution with different additives as a function of the volume Full size image To eliminate the incident I2 in the precursor solution  we propose to create an alkaline environment by introducing additives in the precursor solution  A series of alkaline additives with different alkalinity were employed  such as formamidine acetate ( FAAc  pKa ~764 )  sodium acetate ( CH3COONa  pKa ~924 )  sodium bicarbonate ( NaHCO3  pKa ~1033 )  sodium hydroxide ( NaOH  pKa ~1456 )  and potassium hydroxide ( KOH  pKa ~147 )  to create the full spectrum of alkalinity precursor environment in the context of the alkalinity ( see Supplementary Notes 1 and 2 for details )  Take the alkaline solution of FAAc/ethanol for example  we observed that along with an increasing amount of FAAc  the absorbance at 360 nm for precursor solution was dramatically reduced ( Fig  1a )  Similarly  reduced absorbance at 360 nm was also observed when FAAc was added to the iodine solution ( 10−4 M  Supplementary Fig  1 )  This indicates that the diminishing absorbance at 360 nm in the precursor solution is due to the reduction of incident I2  Furthermore  CH3COONa  NaHCO3  NaOH  and KOH took the same effects as expected when added to the precursor solution ( Fig  1b–e )  Meanwhile  the addition of pure ethanol does not reduce the absorption peak of I3− ( Supplementary Fig  2 )  The disappearance of I3− ( mostly related to I2 ) in the alkaline environment possibly suggests a disproportionation reaction in the precursor solution  wherein I2 is converted into iodate and iodide32 ( see Supplementary Note 3 )  In addition ( Fig  1f )  we found that the alkalinity of additives would largely influence the disproportionation reaction  It requires less amount of NaOH or KOH to eliminate the I2 peak of precursor solution than that of FAAc  CH3COONa  or NaHCO3  mostly because the former ones are ‘ strong ’ alkaline in the context of conventional inorganic chemistry  Morphology  phase  and carrier lifetime analysis The typical two-step approach was employed to fabricate the perovskite films ( see details in the Methods section )  We named the two-step processed reference perovskite film ( ( FA  MA  Cs ) Pb ( I  Br ) 3 ) as the PVSK film  To ascertain the impact of alkaline additives on the morphology and crystallographic structure of the resultant films  we performed scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) measurements accordingly  Compared with the PVSK film  the perovskite films with CH3COONa or FAAc additive exhibited enlarged grain size ( Fig  2a–c )  while those with NaOH or KOH remain the same grain size ( Fig  2d  Supplementary Fig  3 )  It possibly indicates the different crystallization kinetics during film growth induced by the alkaline additives  Upon the employment of CH3COONa or FAAc  volatile acetate ions are reported to facilitate grain growth for better film quality33  which might account for the relatively enlarged grain size  On the contrary  perovskite films with the introduction of NaOH or KOH showed similar grain size  but a distinct crystalline grain morphology  as compared with the reference  It is often ascribed to the fact that Na+ or K+ is too small to incorporate into the perovskite lattice according to the Goldschmidt tolerance factor34  However  we can not fully rule out the influences for crystal growth in the kinetics perspective  given the different chemical environments introduced by different alkalines  which will be discussed later  Fig  2 figure 2 Morphology  phase  and carrier lifetime analysis  SEM images for the perovskite films

alkaline additives Full size image Furthermore  XRD results showed a dominating α-phase perovskite in all films ( Fig  2e )  indicating that all these additives do not impact the thermodynamics of crystal growth substantially  However  PbI2 conversion process was affected by additives  as inferred from the formation of δ-phase perovskite  as well as the residual PbI2  We purposely controlled the stoichiometry in all samples with a bit excessive of PbI2 for efficient passivation3536 ( see also Supplementary Note 4 )  We observed that perovskite films with mild alkaline additives ( CH3COONa or NaHCO3 ) only exhibited a relatively stronger PbI2 peak  while a distinct δ-phase perovskite peak occurred when strong alkaline additives ( NaOH or KOH ) were added during film fabrication  It suggests that the alkalinity of the additives would affect the formation of the by-products  where the stronger alkaline would promote the formation of the δ-phase and suppress the formation of the α-phase perovskite as well  To confirm our speculation  MA ( pKa = 1062 ) /ethanol was introduced into the precursor solution ( Fig  2f )  We found a considerable amount of δ-phase perovskite in the resultant perovskite film  As predicted  the formation of the α-phase perovskite was suppressed substantially when the content of MA/ethanol was twice more  Interestingly  compared with the other additives  the weak alkaline FAAc resulted in the desirable phase quality  with significantly improved film crystallinity and less PbI2 content  as compared with that of the reference and other additives  The intrinsic defects in perovskite films affect the photogenerated carrier behavior and device performance  which also would be affected by the alkalinity of the additives  We therefore conducted time-resolved photoluminescence ( TRPL ) analysis to study the dynamics of carrier recombination  The perovskite films were deposited on glass by using a precursor solution with different alkaline additives  The TRPL decay curves ( Fig  2g ) were fitted with the bi-exponential rate law ( Supplementary Table 1 )  We found that the perovskite films with addition of a weak alkaline possessed a longer carrier lifetime than those with the addition of a strong alkaline  The prolonged lifetime of perovskite films with a weak alkaline additive  compared with that of the PVSK film  was attributed to the suppression of incident I2 in precursor solution and the desired film features  eg  morphology and phase  Among all samples with alkaline additives  the perovskite film with FAAc exhibited the longest lifetime for both fast and slow recombination ( τ1 = 1327 ns and τ2 = 8022 ns )  indicating its lowest non-radiative recombination centers  To be noted  the introduction of Na+ or K+ also could possibly deform the perovskite crystal structure  which may lead to shallow defect sites or off-bandgap defects in perovskite films37383940 ( see Supplementary Note 5 )  Crystallization kinetics control via alkalinity We further investigate the underlying crystallization kinetics of the formation of the α-phase perovskite by developing an in situ UV-vis absorption measurement  In a typical experiment  the organic cation solution was spin-coated onto the annealed PbI2 layer  which was further characterized by a UV-vis absorption spectrometer immediately  By varying the alkalinity in precursor solution ( Fig  3a )  we clearly observed that the formation of the α-phase perovskite  whose main absorption peak ranged from 450 to 800 nm  was suppressed substantially when the alkalinity gets stronger  To be noted  the absorption before 450 nm might stem from the PbI2 or the δ-phase perovskite  Moreover  we judiciously selected two typical alkaline additives  eg  FAAc ( weak alkaline ) and NaOH ( strong alkaline )  and continuously tracked the conversion evolution from PbI2 to the α-phase perovskite  Compared with the reference ( Fig  3b )  the weak alkaline does not affect the formation of the α-phase perovskite  as expected  Accordingly  the absorption peak of the α-phase perovskite in the main range ( 450–800 nm ) is increased continuously as time grows  The inset figure in Fig  3b provides a visualization of the improved absorption in the range of 450 and 800 nm  suggesting the continuous formation of the α-phase perovskite  On the contrary ( Fig  3c )  the formation of the α-phase perovskite with a strong alkaline was suppressed substantially  Even over time  only small changes occurred  as visualized in the inset figure of Fig  3c  Based on the above analysis  we confirmed that the crystallization kinetics of the transformation from PbI2 to the α-phase perovskite  namely the activation energy  was influenced by the alkalinity of additives  As shown in scheme ( Fig  3d )  when the alkalinity in the precursor gets stronger  the activation energy becomes larger  leading to an increased barrier for the transformation from the PbI2 to the α-phase perovskite  The results suggest that while incident I2 could be effectively eliminated via a disproportionation reaction under various alkaline environments  the alkalinity of the additives is also crucial to fabricate high-quality perovskite films with a desired phase  Because of the enrichment of the OH− anion when alkalinity gets stronger  we speculate that the oxygen in the OH− anion could participate in the coordination with lead iodide with stronger bonding  This may facilitate the structural transformation from PbI2 to the δ-phase perovskite  leading to an increased energy barrier for the transformation of PbI2 to the α-phase perovskite  Fig  3 figure 3 Crystallization kinetics control of perovskite films  a Real-time UV-vis

NaOH  The inset figures are derived from the change of absorption intensity ( ∆I ) for each sample at different times and the y-axis is the right one ( Time )  d Schematic illustration for the impacts of alkalinity on the crystallization kinetics of perovskite films  e Activation energies of the α- and δ-phase of FAPbI3 in the dependence of OH− concentration Full size image To verify the argument  we further performed the DFT simulation to analyze the exact activation energy for the formation of both the α-phase and δ-phase of the FAPbI3 perovskite in different conditions  The Calculation setup was given in Methods and Supplementary Note 6  As shown in Fig  3e  two converse trends of the activation energy change are observed upon the introduction of OH− into synthesis  At the low OH− concentration  the δ-phase FAPbI3 has shown a much higher activation energy of 5352 eV  which is 1834 eV higher than that of the α-phase  As the OH− concentration increases  the activation energies of δ-phase FAPbI3 decline from 5352 to 4143 eV  However  the activation energies of α-phase FAPbI3 increase from 3518 to 4293 eV  and finally exceed that of δ-phase FAPbI3  It clearly suggests that the formation of the α-phase perovskite is only preferred at a low OH− concentration  With the increase of OH− concentration  δ-phase FAPbI3 is more preferred kinetically  which is in consistent with the observation of the experiments above  Weak alkaline additives to reduce defect state density To generalize the above findings  we selected three alkalines with a weak alkalinity  such as FAAc  triethanolamine hydrochloride ( TEAHCl  pKa ~78 )  and sodium hypophosphite ( NaH2PO2  pKa ~74 )  and incorporated them into different perovskite material systems  respectively  We conducted the TRPL measurement to characterize the carrier recombination profile of different perovskite films  The corresponding devices are subject to photovoltaic performance investigations ( see Supplementary Note 7 )  The results demonstrate that the additives with a weak alkalinity could successfully decrease the trap state density of iodine-based perovskite films via effectively inhibiting incident I2 in the precursor solution  Combining the influence for alkalinity on the crystallization kinetics of perovskite films  the resultant devices show improved photovoltaic efficiency  To obtain an in-depth understanding of the influence of a weak alkaline on the defect state of the perovskite  we chose the FAAc as an example and named the corresponding two-step processed perovskite film ( ( FA  MA  Cs ) Pb ( I  Br ) 3–FAAc ) as the PVSK–FA  At first  steady-state photoluminescence ( PL ) spectra of PVSK and PVSK–FA over a temperature from 78 to 350 K were obtained and investigated ( Fig  4a  b )  Within the temperature range of interest  the emission peak of PVSK–FA exhibited a distinct red shift as compared with PVSK  which was consistent with the UV-vis absorption results ( Supplementary Fig  4 )  It indicates a higher ratio of FA+ incorporated into the PVSK–FA due to the addition of an additive in the precursor  It was documented that the MAPbI3 film exhibited a broadening inhomogeneous multi-peak emission feature from a low-temperature phase  partially attributed to additional charge or exciton trap states only activated in low temperature41  However  in Figure 4a  b  we did not observe the above-mentioned multi-peak feature at a low temperature in the PVSK and PVSK–FA  indicating the characteristics of less traps  With temperature increasing  we observed a broadening of the emission line due to the electron–phonon coupling near room temperature  which was a consistent recent study in the FAPbI3 film42  Interestingly  the PL spectra of the PVSK–FA exhibited a better symmetry than the PVSK with temperature increasing from 250 to 350 K ( Fig  4c )  On the one hand  the absence of an asymmetric feature in this film may suggest significant reduction of defect states near the band edge  It is believed that reduced grain boundaries may lead to reduced defects43  which is consistent with the morphology analysis of larger grains in the corresponding films ( Fig  2a  b )  On the other hand  better symmetry in the PL peak indicates the absence of shoulder peaks often attributed to the slight phase segregation in the mixed perovskites37  It is thus implied that PVSK–FA possibly exhibited a retarded phase segregation and decreased defect states  when compared with the PVSK  Fig  4 figure 4 Weak alkaline additives to reduce defect state density  Color plots of

for both devices obtained by thermal admittance spectroscopy at room temperature Full size image We further carefully examined the luminescence efficiency of the absorber  which serves as an important measure to identify a high-quality semiconductor444546  Generally  deep-level defects serve as non-radiative recombination centers to capture the photogenerated charge carriers  thereby dramatically cutting down the quantum efficiency of photoluminescence and photovoltaic efficiency in solar cells  To be noted  a good solar cell has to be a good light-emitting diode44  According to Shockley–Queisser equation  the VOC of the device decreases when the luminescence quantum efficiency of the absorber decreases  Here  the PL quantum efficiency ( PLQE ) of the perovskite film was examined as a function of excitation power ( Fig  4d )  The PLQE was relatively small for either PVSK or PVSK–FA at low excitation power  but rapidly went up with the increase of excitation power  It indicates that the radiative recombination prevails at high optical injection levels  wherein non-radiative recombination centers were filled up  which have been further discussed in Supplementary Note 8  Notably  the PLQE of PVSK–FA achieved 61 % when the excitation power was 100 mW cm–2 ( close to the device working condition )  which is more than twice as that of PVSK ( PLQE = 25 % )  It further revealed obvious enhancement of PLQE compared with PVSK among the entire excitation power range  confirming the reduction of deep-level defect state in PVSK–FA  It correlates to the improvement in VOC in the corresponding device  as will be discussed later  To find the defect energy level in the perovskite films  we conducted thermal admittance spectroscopy ( TAS ) analysis  It is widely adopted in perovskite solar cells to extract the native defect state-level information through the identification of junction capacitance  Given a p-type perovskite semiconductor  the defect activation energy ( Ea ) is approximately the depth of defect state energy level relative to the valance band of the perovskite4748  Here  TAS measurement was carried out from 250 to 350 K with a step of 10 K to obtain the temperature-dependent admittance spectra for PVSK and PVSK–FA-based devices ( Fig  4e  f )  The characteristic transition angular frequency ( ω0 ) was extracted from the derivative of the capacitance–frequency spectrum  The relationship between Ea and ω0 follows the equation : ω0 = βT2 exp ( −Ea/kT )  where β is a temperature-dependent parameter  k is the Boltzmann ’ s constant  and T is the temperature  The Arrhenius plot ( Fig  4g ) derived from the temperature-dependent ω0 and fitted curves revealed that the Ea of PVSK and PVSK–FA devices were 0282 and 0238 eV  respectively  Moreover  we attempted to illustrate the energetic profile regarding the trap density of states ( tDOS ) in the perovskite absorber ( Fig  4h )  It could be derived from the equation NT ( Eω ) = − ωVbi/qkTW × dC/dω and Eω = kT ln ( βT2/ω )  where q is the elementary charge  ω is the angular frequency  Vbi is the built-in potential  and W is the depletion region  respectively49  The Vbi and W were obtained from the Mott–Schottky analysis ( Supplementary Fig  5 )  As expected  the PVSK device exhibited a relatively large density of defect states  especially around the deep defect level at 0282 eV  Previous DFT calculation study26 reported that this defect-state level ( 0282 eV ) could potentially be ascribed to iodine interstitials ( Ii )  which was the deep-level defect state and dominating non-radiative recombination centers in devices  Interestingly  the PVSK–FA device exhibited a striking reduction of the deep-level defect state at 0282 eV for two orders of magnitude  In addition  the shallow defect states ( 01–02 eV ) were also suppressed  Considering the analysis above  we reasonably claim that the introduction of a weak alkaline additive could effectively suppress the incident I2 in the precursor solution and significantly reduce the Ii defect states and achieve a much smaller defect activation energy in the resultant perovskite films  In this case  our iodine suppression approach looks contradictory with the previous research29 ; however  we argue that the discrepancy in these two approaches of iodine management is mostly due to different physiochemical properties in the corresponding absorber layers  It likely stemmed from the two film growth techniques applied and different material compositions  which is further discussed in Supplementary Note 9  Beside of defects at the deep energy level  tail defects at the band edge were further investigated  Urbach tail profiles of perovskite films were calculated according to the formula equation : α = α0 exp ( hv/EU )  where α0 is a constant  EU denotes Urbach energy  and α is an absorption coefficient  The absorption coefficient versus energy plots were presented in Supplementary Fig  6  As is reported3350  low EU is highly desirable for semiconductor devices  indicative of less electronic disorders in the crystal lattice ( or less impurities )  Accordingly  the EU values were estimated to be 3122 and 2964 meV for PVSK and PVSK–FA  respectively  Assuming the same level of thermal disorder  the smaller EU value obtained from PVSK–FA demonstrated a lower level of electronic disorder at the band edge  To quantitatively assess the concentration of defects across the entire device  the current density–voltage curves under the dark state for capacitor-like devices with indium tin oxide ( ITO ) /perovskite/gold ( Au ) configuration were measured ( Supplementary Fig  7 )  The linear current density–voltage relation at the low bias suggested an ohmic response  and the transition point was considered as the voltage at which all the traps were filled ( trap-filled limit voltage : VTFL )  The concentration of defects was determined by the equation Ndefects = 2εε0VTFL/qL2  where q is the elementary charge  ε is the relative dielectric constant  ε0 is the vacuum permittivity  and L is the thickness of the perovskite films obtained from the cross-sectional SEM images of the ITO/perovskite/Au devices ( Supplementary Fig  8 )  It is reasonable to assume that the slight introduction of an additive would not affect the relative dielectric constants of perovskite films significantly51  The defect density Ndefects was estimated to be 138 × 1016 and 047 × 1016 cm−3 for PVSK and PVSK–FA devices  respectively  It clearly confirms that the defect density in the perovskite absorber has been significantly reduced to nearly an order of magnitude by the addition of a weak alkaline additive  Moreover  we have conducted femtosecond optical measurements52 and confirmed that PVSK–FA exhibited a lower defect density than the PVSK film  which is the same order of magnitude as the above result ( Supplementary Note 10 )  Weak alkaline additive to improve photovoltaic performance The significant reduction in intrinsic defect density within the perovskite film was expected to suppress the non-radiative recombination channel effectively and improve the device performance  To prove it  we fabricated the planar heterojunction devices using the structure ITO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au ( Supplementary Fig  9 ) and studied the impacts of weak alkaline additives on photovoltaic performance  Figure 5a presents the current density–voltage ( J–V ) curves of the optimized perovskite devices measured under standard AM 15 G at ambient condition  The typical PVSK device yielded a PCE of 1997 % with a VOC of 1102 V  a short-circuit current density ( JSC ) of 2383 mA cm–2  and a fill factor ( FF ) of 7605 %  Meanwhile  the best PVSK–FA device exhibited a significantly improved performance with a VOC of 1145 V  a JSC of 2405 mA cm–2  a FF of 7631 %  and the corresponding PCE of 2101 %  One of our best devices was sent to the accredited PV calibration laboratory ( Newport  USA ) and the certified PCE was 2087 % ( Supplementary Fig  10 )  The slightly enhanced JSC value was attributed to improved light-harvesting capacity and a slightly red shift of the absorption onset  The major improvement in device performance was contributed from VOC enhancement  thanks to the high-quality perovskite thin film with significantly reduced intrinsic defect density by the addition of a weak alkaline additive  Fig  5 figure 5 Photovoltaic device performance  a Current density–voltage curves for PVSK and

radiation at ambient condition  e The transient photovoltage decay curves and ( f ) VOC as a function of light intensity for the PVSK and PVSK–FA devices Full size image To be emphasized  in the present study  the addition of FAAc could slightly reduce the bandgap of the resultant film from 157 eV to 156 eV but increase VOC from 1102 to 1147 V in the resulting device  It is interesting that although the bandgap of the perovskite film decreased  the VOC of the relevant solar devices actually improved ( Fig  5b )  It thus reveals one vital feature for this high-efficiency device  which is the small VOC deficit ( defined as Eg/q −VOC  where Eg is the optical bandgap and q is the elemental charge )  VOC deficit is an essential indicator to measure the potential of the photovoltaic material and the maturity of the relevant technology  Current VOC deficit for c-silicon  GaAs  and organic solar cells are around 400  300  and 600 mV  respectively53  Surprisingly  the corresponding VOC deficit in our device decreased to 413 mV upon FAAc addition  wherein both the VOC ( 1147 V ) and the bandgap ( 156 eV ) were certified through a third party  The VOC deficit of 413 mV is one of the smallest certified value for planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells to date  It further implies substantially reduced non-radiative recombination losses in the PVSK–FA device  which was consistent with the high PLQE measured previously  In addition  we did not observe an appreciable J–V hysteresis in the corresponding device  and the average PCE of 2091 % was achieved ( Fig  5c and Supplementary Fig  10 )  The integrated photocurrent density gave a calculated value of 2347 mA cm−2 from the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectrum ( Supplementary Fig  11 )  which was comparable with the result from J–V measurement  In addition  a steady-state current density of 2189 mA cm−2 and a stabilized PCE of 2080 %  were also achieved by holding the voltage at the maximum power point ( 095 V ) for the PVSK–FA device ( Fig  5d )  To probe the reliability and repeatability  20 individual devices were fabricated with the identical processing condition and the corresponding statistical distribution of the PCE values was presented ( Supplementary Fig  12 )  The average efficiency for the PVSK and PVSK–FA devices were 1934 % and 2063 %  respectively  Furthermore  we have investigated the long-term stability of the PVSK and PVSK–FA-based devices  as shown in Supplementary Fig  13  The reference without further encapsulation degraded to be around 80 % within 1500 h of storage in an N2 glove box  whereas the PVSK–FA-based devices exhibited less degradation  It is possibly because of the higher thin-film quality of PVSK–FA with reduced defect states  which inhibits the penetration of undesirable water or oxygen molecules that further decompose perovskite films  Meanwhile  it may also correlate to the elimination of incident I2  which has been demonstrated to induce the chemical chain degradation of the perovskite31  To gain further insights into the carrier dynamics across the device  we measured transient photocurrent ( TPC ) and photovoltage ( TPV ) decays of PVSK and PVSK–FA-based devices on the microsecond scale54  The PVSK–FA-based device exhibited a faster decay than that of the PVSK-based device  and the charge transport lifetime ( τt ) derived from TPC measurements ( Supplementary Fig  14 ) was decreased from 413 to 197 μs  indicating a dramatic improvement of charge transport capability for the PVSK–FA-based device  The TPV curves were correlated to the carrier recombination rates under the open-circuit condition in the full cell  We observed that the PVSK–FA-based device demonstrated a much slower decay  when compared with that of the PVSK-based device ( Fig  5e )  The charge recombination lifetime ( τr ) derived from the TPV curves was significantly prolonged from 1240 to 1937 μs  suggesting that the carrier recombination was predominately prohibited in the device  It indicates that the prolonged lifetime constant τr contributed from substantially reduced defect density in the perovskite material by the addition of weak alkaline additives  Furthermore  we measured the VOC change as a function of illumination intensity to elucidate the carrier recombination mechanism during device operation  For both PVSK and PVSK–FA-based devices  the VOC increased monotonically with incident light intensity ( Fig  5f )  According to the equation VOC = nkT/q ln ( ISC/I0 + 1 )  the values of the ideality factor were calculated to be 151 and 102  respectively  Generally  the ideality factor derails from unity if Shockley–Read–Hall ( SRH ) recombination occurs55  In our study  the ideality factor for the PVSK–FA-based device showed a significant reduction from 151 to 102  when compared with that of the PVSK-based device  It demonstrates that trap-assisted SRH recombination was suppressed substantially due to the reduced intrinsic defect density  which was in good agreement with previous results  Discussion In summary  we demonstrate a universal pathway to effectively suppress the incident I2 defects and manipulate the stoichiometry via the iodine disproportionation reaction under an alkaline environment  The alkalinity is proven to be a crucial parameter that greatly impacts the crystallization kinetics and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite films  A weak alkaline consisting of the FA+ cation was demonstrated to serve as a ‘ residual ’ free agent to suppress deep-level defect density in the mixed perovskites ( ( FA  MA  Cs ) Pb ( I  Br ) 3 )  which provides extra benefits in tuning the A-site stoichiometry and film morphology  Featured with a narrower bandgap of the absorber though  the device exhibited a significant enhancement on VOC  It observed one of the smallest VOC deficits of 413 mV in a certified planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell with an average PCE of 2087 %  These findings would bridge the gap between precursor chemistry and deep-level defect behavior in the perovskite film  particularly the iodide-based perovskite  which

then spin-coated onto glass/ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 s  and finally baked on a hot plate at 150 °C for 30 min in ambient air  Preparation of the perovskite precursor and films To prepare the PbI2 and organic cation precursors  600 mg of PbI2 and 18 mg of CsI were dissolved in 1 mL of mixture solvent of DMF : DMSO ( 9:1 v : v ) and then annealed on a hot plate at 70 °C for 2 h with vigorous stirring  In all  40 mg of FAI  19 mg of MAI  6 mg of MABr  and 5 mg of MACl were dissolved in 1 mL of isopropanol and then continuously stirred for 2 h at room temperature  To prepare the alkaline additive solution  45 mg of different additives were dissolved in 1 mL of anhydrous ethyl alcohol at 70 °C for 30 min with vigorous stirring  Due to the different solubility of alkaline

different OH− concentration58  which was also self-consistently suggested by total energy minimization  With this special k-point sampling  the total energy is converged within the maximum expected self-consistent cycles  Characterization The absorbance of different precursor solutions and perovskite films was measured by a Hitachi UH4150 spectrophotometer  The integrating sphere was employed

250–350 K ) in the dark from 100 to 106 Hz  A small AC voltage of 50 mV was used  and the DC bias was kept at zero to avoid the influence of the ferroelectric effect for perovskite materials during measurement  For temperature-dependent characterization  the sample was mounted in the Cryo Industries Liquid Nitrogen Dewars with Lake Shore model 335 cryogenic temperature controller  The current density–voltage ( J–V ) curves were measured ( 2400 Series SourceMeter  Keithley Instruments ) under a simulated AM 15 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 ( Newport Thermal Oriel 91192 1000-W solar simulator )  The light intensity was calibrated using a KG-5 Si diode  The J–V measurements were carried out in ambient air  The sweep speed was fixed at 40 mV s–1 ( step 002 V  delay time 500 ms )

availability The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon requestrganic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells have been in the limelight in recent years due to their outstanding power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) and facile synthesis  Despite of the ever increasing PCE that astonishes the solar cell community  many fundamental structural and theoretical aspects remain elusive  which inhibit our understanding on this fascinating material  Methylammonium iodide ( MAI ) is one important precursor to fabricate the halide perovskite materials based on the prototypical CH3NH3PbI3  Some MAI might remain in the CH3NH3PbI3 layer  forming a MAI-rich layer that is considered strongly affecting the perovskite solar cell performance  Therefore it is helpful to take one step back to re-evaluate the structures of MAI that is overlooked in many perovskite solar cell studies  In this manuscript  we identify the alternative structures of MAI aggregates via the ab-initio calculations  including the monomeric  dimeric  trimeric  tetrameric  pentameric  hexameric  heptameric  octameric and decameric structures of MAI  These aggregate structures are proposed to act as a simplified  yet efficient model to represent the MAI-rich region in perovskite solar cells that are usually simulated using the computationally expensive slab model  We find that the aggregates of MAI are universally stabilized by the hydrogen bonds  We further evaluate these MAI aggregate structures via studying the interactions between the MAI aggregates and an experimentally-proven additive iodopentafluorobenzene ( IPFB ) as an example  and show that the iodine atoms in the MAI aggregates acting as potential charge traps could be passivated by the additive molecule  The present study provides an efficient modeling platform for the MAI-rich halide perovskite materials without high computational cost  This is a preview of subscription content  log in via an institutionWe have investigated the dependency of hysteresis in all-ambient-processed perovskite solar cells on the solvent used for the synthesization of perovskite  Methylammonium lead iodide ( MAI ) perovskite solar cells have been fabricated using the two-step sequential spin coating method  The influences of PbI2 precursor on the cell performance and its hysteresis are investigated using four different solvents of pure dimethylformamide ( DMF )  pure dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) and mixtures of DMF : DMSO with the ratios of ( 4:1 ) and ( 1:4 )  The results indicate that a small amount of DMSO in DMF leads to produce large grains of perovskite with proper coverages at the interfaces with hole and electron transport layers  The best conversion efficiency of 109 % was obtained for the cell prepared by the solvent of ( 4:1 ) for DMF : DMSO  The best hysteresis was also obtained from the same cell with the hysteresis index of 0009  Similar content being viewed by others Advances in

lead-free AgBiI4 Rudorffite solar cell with HCl as an additive Article 16 February 2024 1 Introduction Organolead trihalide perovskite materials have successfully been used as light absorbers in photovoltaic cells [ 1  2 ]  Over the last ten years  starting with a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 381 % in 2009 [ 3 ]  the fabricated devices reached a huge leap to about 10 % efficiency in 2012 [ 4  5 ]  and then improved rapidly to higher than 227 % [ 6 ]  A phenomenon remarkably restricts the widespread application of solar cells is hysteresis  which generally appears as the difference between the forward and the reverse voltage sweepings [ 7 ]  For the perovskite solar cells operated under enough high scanning rates  significant hysteresis appears in the current−voltage curves  Two important phenomena have been recognized as the origins of hysteresis including the charge trapping at the interfaces and the ion migrations inside the perovskite layer [ 8 ]  Of course  device structure and quality of the interfaces in addition to the crystal defects can affect the hysteresis in the perovskite cells  Generally  the performance of a perovskite solar cell is quite sensitive to humidity and oxygen  Indeed  photovoltaic performance of the perovskite cells dramatically decays by cell fabrication outside a glovebox [ 91011 ]  Although a PCE of about 185 % has been reported for ambient-processed perovskite fabrication [ 12 ]  most air-processed cells have efficiencies less than 15 % [ 13 ]  To find the best way for high-quality perovskite fabrication under ambient conditions  several reports have been proposed to optimize the formation of perovskite layer outside a glovebox [ 141516 ]  In this work  we have studied the dependency of hysteresis in all-ambient-processed perovskite solar cells on the solvent for producing the perovskite layer  Four different solvents including pure DMF ( dimethylformamide )  pure DMSO ( dimethyl sulfoxide )  and two mixtures of them have been studied here  The best morphology and the best efficiency in addition to the least hysteresis are obtained using the mixed solvent of DMF/DMSO with the ratio of 4:1  This study focused on the method for fabrication of uniform perovskite layer under ambient conditions to achieve low hysteresis perovskite solar cells  2 Experimental details The perovskite solar cells were fabricated using the standard two-step method [ 17 ]  The cell configuration includes fluorine-doped tin oxide ( FTO ) /TiO2-block/TiO2-mesoporous/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD ( 22′77′-tetrakis [ N  N-di ( 4-methoxyphenyl ) amino ] -99′-spirobifluorene ) /gold  For preparing the perovskite layer  PbI2 ( 1 m ) was prepared by spin coating at the rotation speed of 3000 rpm for 8 s followed by 6000 rpm for 8 s The two-step annealing of 40 °C for 5 min and 100 °C for 5 min was carried out after the spin coating  The methylammonium iodide ( MAI ) solution with a concentration of 9 mg/ml was dropped on the PbI2 layer and then the samples were rotated with the speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s An annealing at 100 °C for 5 min was conducted thereafter  Fabrication steps of the perovskite layer are summarized in Fig  1  The solutions of pure DMF and DMSO and their mixtures with volume ratios of DMF : DMSO ( 4:1 ) and DMF : DMSO ( 1:4 ) were prepared as the precursor solvents  The details of fabrication process of various layers of the cells have been described [ 17 ]  Fig  1 figure 1 Two-step spin coating method for preparation of the perovskite layer Full size image 3 Results To investigate the effect of morphology of the perovskite layer on the hysteresis of the cells  we prepared the PbI2 precursor film with DMF  DMSO  and their mixtures  This will affect the crystal structure and crystalline size of the perovskite grains as shown in the X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) patterns in Fig  2  There are three important peaks for perovskite at the 2θ angles of 143°  286°  and 406°  which are referred to the planes of ( 100 )  ( 200 )  and ( 224 ) for the cubic perovskite crystal  The appearance of these peaks in the XRD patterns indicates the formation of perovskite in the samples [ 18  19 ]  The greater peaks of ( 200 ) and ( 211 ) for the perovskite of the solution DMF 4:1 DMSO indicates that using such solvent leads to better crystalline structure for the absorbing layer especially in comparison with the pure DMF case  The scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) images of the perovskite surfaces deposited on the hydrophilized microscope slides for the different solvents are shown in Fig  3  The perovskite layer fabricated with the solvent of DMF 4:1 DMSO has the largest crystal grains and the best coverage between all perovskite samples  It should be noted that the perovskite layer prepared with the pure DMF solvent has many pinholes on its surface  These pinholes can act as trapping points for the electron–hole pairs leading to higher hysteresis for the cell [ 20  21 ]  The cross-sectional image of the fabricated cell with the mixture DFM 4:1 DMSO indicates proper coverage of the perovskite layer with its adjacent layers  It should be mentioned that the sizes of perovskite grains in Fig  3b and c are different although both figures are related to the same mixture of DFM 4:1 DMSO  The reason is the usage of different substrates for the fabrication of the perovskite layer ( the hydrophilized glass in Fig  3b and the mesoporous TiO2 in Fig  3c  The current–voltage ( J–V ) curves of various cells were measured at the AM 15 light illumination for both forward and reverse scans and the results have been shown in Fig  4  The photovoltaic quantities extracted from these results are represented in Table 1  The J–V curves of all samples for the forward and reverse scans show existence of hysteresis in all cells  We see that for the cells with DMF as the major solvent  the efficiency of the reverse scan can be better than the forward scan  However  for the cells with DMSO as the major solvent  the efficiency of the forward scan is higher than the reverse one  The best efficiency was achieved for the mixture of DMF 4:1 DMSO  The hysteresis index ( HI ) factor is defined as follows : Fig  2 figure 2 XRD patterns of the perovskite prepared using different solvent mixtures Full size image Fig  3 figure 3 SEM images of the perovskite surface prepared on the hydrophilized microscope slides by different solvents : a pure DMF  b mixture of DMF 4:1 DMSO  c mixture of DMF 1:4 DMSO  d pure DMSO  e Cross-sectional SEM image of a complete cell fabricated with the mixture of DMF 4:1 DMSO as the precursor solvent Full size image where and are the current densities when the voltage 08 Voc is applied on the cell for the reverse and the forward scans  respectively [ 22  23 ]  The hysteresis index for the cells has been listed in Table 1  It is seen that a small amount of DMSO in the solvent makes a great improvement on the cell hysteresis due to better crystallinity of the formed perovskite layer  The larger crystalline size leads to larger perovskite grains and then fewer charge trapping occurring for the electron–hole pairs  Accumulation of charge carriers in the grain boundaries resists against the transfer of subsequent carriers through the grains and this leads to more cell hysteresis ( Fig  4 )  The lowest hysteresis is seen for the mixture of DMF 4:1 DMSO with the average HI factor of 0009  Table 1 Photovoltaic parameters measured for different fabricated cells Full size table Fig  4 figure 4 J–V curves of the cells prepared by different solvents  for both forward and reverse scans Full size image Fig  5 figure 5 Distribution of the efficiencies of the cells fabricated by different solvents Full size image The distribution of the efficiencies for the reverse scan of the cells fabricated by different precursor solvents is shown in Fig  5  The cells fabricated with DMF 4:1 DMSO solution has the best efficiency  The distribution was obtained from the data of 8 cells for each solvent mixture  The pure perovskite layer was synthesized on glass for UV–Vis spectroscopy using the piranha treatment [ 24 ]  In the Piranha treatment  we used a mixture of H2SO4 ( concentrated ) : H2O2 ( 30 % ) with the ratio of ( 5:1 )  Due to the strong oxidation property of the solution  it can remove all metals and organic contaminants from the surface of the glass  Also this procedure hydroxylates the glass by adding the OH groups on its surface and making it hydrophilic  The absorption spectra of various perovskite layers synthesized by different solvents under ambient conditions ( shown in Fig  6a ) clearly show that the perovskite made by the superior solvent has a higher light absorption  especially in the red-infrared region  due to having greater crystalline structures [ 25  26 ]  This leads to a higher photon conversion to electron–hole pairs for the superior cell ( Fig  6b )  As a result  a higher short circuit current was achieved from the superior cell  Fig  6 figure 6 a Absorption spectra of different perovskite films  b Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency ( IPCE ) curves for different cells fabricated by various solvents Full size image To investigate the physical reason of the J–V hysteresis in different cells  we measured the electrochemical impedance spectra ( EIS ) of different perovskite cells  All these results have been shown in Fig  7a  The inset in Fig  7a shows the equivalent circuit for extracting the EIS data  The resistance R1 accounts for the conductive substrate resistance  The quantity CPE1 is a constant phase element representing the capacitance of the inorganic film which dominates in medium frequencies  The quantity R2 is the recombination resistance accounting for losses of charge carriers  Also  R3 is the transport resistance of charges between the perovskite layer and its neighboring interfacial materials and CPE2 is for the capacitance of charge accumulation in the cells  which dominates at the low-frequency region  The EIS results show that such higher photocurrent in the superior cell ( with DMF 4:1 DMSO ) sees a less recombination resistance at the interfaces of perovskite with the electron and hole transport layers  In fact  the largest radius of the EIS plot for the superior cell indicates the larger resistance against the recombination of charges and this leads to a smaller chance for the recombination in this cell [ 27 ]  Fig  7 figure 7 a Nyquist impedance spectra for various cells under the light illumination at AM15 with a bias voltage of 300 mV for all cells  The equivalent RC circuit for the EIS fitting is also shown in the inset  b Capacitance bode diagrams for perovskite cells fabricated by various solvents Full size image Fig  8 figure 8 Open circuit voltage decay for different cells Full size image In Fig  7b  the capacitance measured by the EIS analysis as a function of frequency has been shown for different cells fabricated by various precursor solvents  At low frequencies  the cell capacitance mostly relates to the movement of slowly moving charges ( ions )  In this case  because of the more pinholes in the perovskite layer of the cells fabricated by DMF as the major solvent  more accumulation of ions occurs at the interfaces of these cells  This leads to higher low-frequency capacitance and more J−V hysteresis for the DMF-based cells  On the other hand  at high frequencies  because the cell capacitance is related to fast charges ( electron and holes )  all the cells show similar capacitance behaviors  Open circuit voltage decay is a measurement that indicates the accumulation of ions at the perovskite interfaces with electron transport material ( ETM ) and hole transport material ( HTM )  Figure 8 shows the open circuit voltage ( Voc ) decay for the cells fabricated with different precursor solvents  For the cell fabricated by DMF 4:1 DMSO as the solvent  after switching off the light  the Voc quickly decays to zero  This fast decay mostly relates to the fast movement of electrons and holes  which rapidly diminishes the initial open circuit voltage  Therefore  low-frequency capacitance and the hysteresis are both small for DMF 4:1 DMSO with the most compact layer due to small number of trapped ions at the perovskite interface [ 28 ]  However  for the perovskite layer with other solvents  more ions can be trapped at the interface of perovskite with ETM/HTM layers and after switching off the light  these ions remain between the perovskite grains and decay of VOC takes longer times  In particular  for the cells fabricated with DMF as the solvent  the Voc has relatively long residual even after 3 s This relatively high residual Voc  which mostly relates to the ions existing at the interfaces  is the main origin of hysteresis for the pure DMF cell [ 17  29 ]  4 Conclusions We studied the dependency of hysteresis in all-ambient-processed perovskite solar cells on the solution mixture of the PbI2 precursor  Our experiments show that the best results for reducing hysteresis obtained for the mixture ratio of 4:1 for DMF : DMSO with a hysteresis index of 0009  Various characterizations showed that the higher crystalline sizes and the better coverage of the perovskite surfaces are the main reasons for better generation and transport of the charge carriers in the superior cellInorganic halide perovskites such as cesium lead halide are promising due to their excellent thermal stability  Cesium lead iodide ( CsPbI3 ) has a bandgap of 173 eV and is very suitable for making efficient tandem solar cells  either with low-bandgap perovskite or silicon  However  the phase instability of CsPbI3 is hindering the further optimization of device performance  Here  we show that high quality and stable α-phase CsPbI3 film is obtained via solvent-controlled growth of the precursor film in a dry environment  A 157 % power conversion efficiency of CsPbI3 solar cells is achieved  which is the highest efficiency reported for inorganic perovskite solar cells up to now  And more importantly  the devices can tolerate continuous light soaking for more than 500 h without efficiency drop  Similar content being viewed by others Enhancing performance and stability of CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells through

in photovoltaic devices were reported by Miyasaka et al  in 2009  The power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) has increased rapidly to more than 20 % in the past several years1234567891011121314  And the large area module of perovskite solar cells was also demonstrated recently15  Traditional perovskite solar cells were mainly based on organic–inorganic hybrid materials such as methylammonium lead halide ( MAPbX3  X = Cl  Br  I ) and formamidinium lead halide ( FAPbX3  X = Cl  Br  I )  or their mixture1234567891011121314  In addition to humidity instability  the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials also suffer from poor thermal stability due to easy evaporation of the organic parts16  17  Inorganic halide perovskite ( CsPbX3 ) ( X = Cl  Br  I ) could be more thermally stable  it was found that CsPbX3 can sustain temperatures exceeding 400 °C without any phase degradation18  19  This could be the reason of the significant photostability improvement of perovskite solar cells  while incorporating inorganic metal cations such as Cs or Rb into the organic cations in MAPbI3 or FAPbI3 perovskites11  20212223  In addition to the excellent thermal stability  inorganic perovskite such as CsPbI3 showed an optical bandgap of 173 eV24  25  which is an ideal material to configure tandem cells combined with either silicon or low-bandgap perovskite2627282930  Even though similar bandgap could also be obtained from organic/inorganic perovskite by mixture halide strategy  halide segregation could be a critical issue for affecting photostability of the devices  while the halide dopant is more than 30 % ( such as FAPbI06Br04 ) 27  Therefore  it is very meaningful to achieve high efficiency and stable CsPbI3 solar cells  However  it was found that the α-phase ( black phase ) of CsPbI3 could be rapidly degraded to non-photoactive δ-phase ( yellow phase ) in an ambient environment with moisture25  3132333435  It has been explained that the moisture can effectively introduce vacancies in the crystal lattice and lower the free-energy barrier to nucleation  and trigger the phase transition of CsPbI3 perovskite even at room temperature32  33  Previously  there are several efforts to stabilize the α-phase of CsPbI3 to make efficient solar cells25  343536373839404142  such as tuning the tolerance_factor of perovskite structure by partially substituting iodide with bromide to form CsPbI2Br or CsPbIBr234353637  reducing the crystal size25  40  42  or introducing intermediate phase such as Cs4PbI641  All these efforts push the efficiency of inorganic perovskite solar cells to around 10 %  Recently  during the preparation of this manuscript  significant progresses were witnessed  around 13 % PCE of CsPbI3-based solar cells were reported by either doping B site in ABX3 perovskite structure43 or by passivating/stabilizing CsPbI3 quantum dot colloid via organic salt molecular44  45  Even though  there is still a large room for further improving the PCE of CsPbI3 solar cells  To deliver higher efficiency of CsPbI3-based perovskite solar cells  two issues must be resolved  One is forming stable α-phase of CsPbI3 films34  Another one is obtaining the high quality of CsPbI3 layer  similar to the initial development of organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells  the pinholes  and grain boundary in the active layer usually leading to serious recombination and also poor device performance464748  Herein  we show a simple solvent-controlled growth ( SCG ) method to produce high-quality α-phase CsPbI3 perovskite thin films  To avoid phase transformation of CsPbI3 films  from black to yellow phase triggered by moisture25  313233  we processed the films in dry nitrogen environment  and stable α-phase of CsPbI3 was obtained  Adopting the high quality and stable α-phase of CsPbI3 as absorption layer to configure the solar cells  we achieved a PCE of 157 % and a certificated PCE of 1467 %  which represent the highest level of inorganic perovskite solar cells so far  More importantly  our preliminary results show that the CsPbI3 solar cells own excellent photostability  the device can tolerate more than 500 h of continuous light soaking  and no significant efficiency drop is observed  Results Growth of CsPbI3 films We prepared the CsPbI3-precursor films by spin-coating a solution containing PbI2 and CsI in a mixture solvent of N  N-dimethylformamide ( DMF ) and dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO )  It is expected that high boiling point solvent  DMSO ( 189 °C )  could not easily completely escape from the precursor film after spin-coating  The residual DMSO could enhance the mass transport and diffusion  which could improve the film quality if we slow down the evaporation rate of the solvent  Based on this idea  we stand by the precursor films in the nitrogen glove box for several ten minutes before annealing  we named this process as SCG ( Fig  1a )  Fig  1 figure 1 Solvent-controlled growth ( SCG ) for CsPbI3 deposition  a Schematic illustration of CsPbI3-perovskite crystallization procedures via solvent-controlled growth ( SCG )  b Normalized absorption of CsPbI3-precursor films with and

greenish-yellow color ( inset of Fig  1b  Supplementary Fig  1 )  After SCG  we observed that the color of the precursor films gradually changed from greenish-yellow to light black during SCG ( inset

during SCG  The absorption edge of this additional phase is located at 720 nm  which is similar to α-phase CsPbI3 ( 713 nm ) ( Figs  1b and 2b )  but with a little red-shift  X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) results further confirmed the appearance of the additional phase after SCG  For the precursor films without SCG  only the diffraction peaks from the δ-phase CsPbI3 were observed  While for the precursor films with SCG  except for the diffraction peaks from the δ-phase CsPbI3  obvious diffraction peaks located at 142°  144°  202°  286°  and 290° were observed  These diffraction peaks could be from β-phase CsPbI3  which is also a black phase  while owns a slightly distorted crystal structure compared with α-phase CsPbI349 ( Figs  1c and 2a  Supplementary Fig  2b )  Similar β-phase CsPbI3 has been observed while using phenylethylammonium-stabilized CsPbI3 films49  The partial phase change from the δ-phase CsPbI3 to the β-phase CsPbI3 after SCG indicated that the precursor materials were diffused and the precursor film was reconstructed during solvent evaporation  This enhanced mass transport process could be in favor of the uniform and high-quality film formation  Fig  2 figure

annealed CsPbI3 films stored in dry nitrogen box for different days Full size image Accomplished with the formation of an additional phase in the precursor film  we also found that the precursor film became more continuous  and the pinholes in the precursor films have been filled after SCG ( Fig  1d  e )  The improvement of morphology also indicated the enhanced diffusion and also the mass transportation during SCG  This will be helpful for obtaining high-quality α-phase CsPbI3 perovskite film after annealing  Similar SCG method has been adopted in organic solar cells  while high boiling point solvent such as dichlorobenzene is used  and the enhanced polymer crystallization is observed50  while the crystal growth kinetic seems different from the SCG methods shown in this study  As we expected  the annealed CsPbI3-perovskite films with SCG are free of pinholes and showed crystal size above 5 μm ( Fig  1g  Supplementary Fig  3 )  However  the CsPbI3-perovskite films obtained without SCG usually showed a large number of pinholes ( Fig  1f )  The morphology evolution dependent on the SCG times can be found in Supplementary Fig  4  The significant improvement in perovskite films morphology indicated that SCG process is in favor of obtaining high-quality perovskite films  Stability of the α-phase CsPbI3 film in a dry environment We carried out the XRD measurement for the annealed CsPbI3 films  We found that α-phase CsPbI3 crystal was formed by two steps from the precursor films with SCG  For the precursor film with SCG  the δ-phase and β-phase of CsPbI3 coexisted at room temperature  and then was completely changed to δ-phase CsPbI3 after annealing at 150 °C  After that  the precursor film was completely converted into α-phase CsPbI3  while the temperature was increased to 350 °C ( Supplementary Fig  2a )  Encouragingly  we found that the high quality of α-phase CsPbI3 that we obtained via SCG method can be maintained in dry nitrogen environment for a long time  and there is no change in the XRD patterns or absorption spectra after 7 days of storage ( Fig  2a  b )  And furthermore  the films were not degraded even after more than 2 months of storage in a dry environment ( Fig  2c )  indicating that the dry environment can freeze the α-phase of CsPbI325  Consistent with the previous reports25  34  35  we also found the induction of phase changes from black to yellowish-white after exposing the films to ambient air with high humidity ( Supplementary Fig  5 )  Our results showed that the α-phase of CsPbI3 can be maintained at room temperature if we can completely avoid moisture  and additional additives were not needed for phase stabilization25  40  41  434445  Therefore  we can absolutely achieve stable CsPbI3-based solar cells if we can completely avoid moisture  Characterizations of CsPbI3 film We found that the photoluminescence ( PL ) emission peaks of CsPbI3 were blue-shifted from 710 to 703 nm after SCG for 50 min ( Supplementary Fig  6 )  this could be due to the reduction of defect-related traps  while the film quality was improved51  We tested the time-resolved photoluminescence ( TRPL ) of the CsPbI3 films  the lifetime of CsPbI3 was increased from 06 to 52 ns after SCG for 50 min ( Supplementary Fig  6 )  further confirming that the traps have been reduced after SCG of the perovskite layer  We also found that the PL of CsPbI3 was improved gradually with increasing SCG time ( Supplementary Fig  6 )  The lifetime of SCG CsPbI3 films is in few nanoseconds  which is still shorter than that of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite with the lifetime in microseconds52  53  this could be further improved in future  We characterized the chemical states and also the band structure of CsPbI3 film  the full spectrum of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) and core energy-level spectra confirming the inclusion of Cs  Pb  and I element ( Supplementary Fig  7 )  And ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy ( UPS ) measurement was also carried out to determine the band structure of CsPbI3  It could be estimated that the conduction band and valence band of CsPbI3 are about 395 eV and 568 eV  respectively ( Supplementary Fig  8 )  CsPbI3-based solar cells and device performance We adopted the high-quality SCG-CsPbI3 perovskite films as the absorption layer to configure solar cells with the structure of Indium tin oxide ( ITO ) /SnO2/CsPbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au  N-type of SnO2 was used as the electron transport layer  which was confirmed as an excellent electron transport layer in organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells ( Supplementary Fig  9 ) 10  and Spiro-OMeTAD was used as the hole transport layer  A cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) image of the completed device is shown in Supplementary Fig  10  It was found that there is no obvious grain boundary for CsPbI3 in about 3 μm scale  From the SEM image  it can be also estimated that the thicknesses of the SnO2  perovskite layer  Spiro-OMeTAD  and Au are about 25 nm  350 nm  170 nm  and 60 nm  respectively  The device performance for the CsPbI3 films with and without SCG was characterized ( Fig  3a  Supplementary Fig  11 )  Specifically  when the perovskite layer is without SCG  the devices showed poor performance  with open circuit voltage ( VOC ) of 091 V  short-circuit current density ( JSC ) of 1477 mA cm−2  fill factor ( FF ) of 64 %  and the efficiency of only 858 %  The lower performance might be due to too many pinholes in the perovskite layer and lead to serious leakage and recombination46  While SCG were carried out  the device performance enhanced significantly ( Fig  3a  Supplementary Fig  11 and Supplementary Table 1 )  The best performance of 1571 % was obtained when the perovskite layer with optimized SCG time for 50 min  with the VOC of 108 V  JSC of 1841 mA cm−2  and FF of 7932 % ( Fig  3b  reverse scan )  The efficiency we achieved here represents a great improvement compared with the previous reports in CsPbI3-based solar cells ( Supplementary Table 2 )  We tested the device performance under reverse and forward scan  the J–V curves show no appreciable hysteresis between the two different scan directions ( Fig  3b )  Reverse and forward scans showed the efficiency of 1571 % and 1493 %  respectively  the average efficiency is about 1532 % ( Fig  3b )  The typical external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of the CsPbI3 solar cells was given ( Fig  3c ) ; the photoresponse edge is about 720 nm  corresponding to the bandgap of CsPbI3 ( 173 eV )  In the visible region  the EQE can reach up to 85 % with an integrated short-circuit current of 177 mA cm−2  which is almost consistent with the J–V result ( Fig  3a  b )  Our devices also showed good reproducibility  the efficiency is located from 123 to 157 % for 80 devices  and most of the PCEs are about 14 % ( Fig  3d )  Fig  3 figure 3 Device performance of CsPbI3-based solar cells  a J–V curves of the devices using CsPbI3 as the absorber layer  while the CsPbI3 without and with solvent-controlled growth ( SCG )  the SCG time is 50 min  b The device

devices and sent them to photovoltaic calibration laboratory ( Newport  an accredited PV calibration laboratory  USA ) for certification  which confirmed that a stabilized PCE is 1467 %  the VOC is 1097 V  JSC is 180 mA cm−2  and FF is 74 % ( Supplementary Figs  12 and 13 )  As we know  CsPbI3 is very sensitive to moisture  the certificated results showed that there is no significant degradation during shipping and measurements  while the encapsulated devices were completely exposed to ambient air with moisture for a long time ( 192 h )  inferring that the phase stability issue of CsPbI3 could be completely solved by encapsulation  Device stability The stability of perovskite solar cells is a critical issue22  28  5455565758596061  we tested the device s stability in the dark and also under continuous light soaking  We found that the device can almost keep its original efficiency when stored in dry nitrogen for 720 h ( 30 days ) ( Supplementary Fig  14 and Supplementary Table 3 )  More importantly  we found that our device showed excellent photostability under continuous light soaking in dry nitrogen environment  After 500 h of continuous light soaking ( AM 15G  100 mW cm−2 with 420 nm UV light filter  temperature : approximately 25 °C )  the device can maintain its original efficiency and no drop ( Fig  4a )  As an example  the initial PCE of the device is 1297 %  after 156 h of continuous light soaking  the efficiency was slightly increased to 137 %  which could be due to the improvement of the contact  and then dropped a little to 1274 % after 500 h of light soaking ( Fig  4b  Supplementary Table 4 )  The good photostability of CsPbI3 solar cells could be due to the excellent thermal stability or large ion migration barrier of the inorganic perovskite materials37  Longer-time photostability measurements are also carried out  Further improvement of the CsPbI3-solar cells stability could be by doping of the perovskite layer34  43  58  interface

continuous light-soaking time Full size image Discussion We found that our SCG method could be extended to obtain high-quality CsPbI2Br films ( Supplementary Fig  15 )  According to SCG  a 1421 % PCE of CsPbI2Br solar cells has been obtained ( Supplementary Fig  16 and Supplementary Table 5 )  Using this SCG method  we have also achieved as high as 1614 % and 981 % PCE of CsPb ( I085Br015 ) 3- and CsPbBr3-based solar cells  respectively ( Supplementary Fig  17 )  These results indicated that our SCG method is universal at least for high-quality inorganic perovskite films growth and also for obtaining efficient solar cells  In conclusion  a 157 % PCE of CsPbI3 solar cells have been achieved by SCG of the absorb layer  and the devices can tolerate above 500 h of continuous light soaking  There is still a large room for device performance  especially on the open-circuit voltage  considering the bandgap of CsPbI3 ( 173 eV ) ; a 13 V open-circuit voltage should be feasible for CsPbI3 solar cells if the contact and the defect can be perfectly controlled  and the efficiency will be close to or beyond 20 %  Methods Materials SnO2-colloid precursor ( tin ( IV ) oxide  15 % in H2O colloidal dispersion )  DMF  and DMSO were purchased from Alfa Aesar  CsI and PbI2 were purchased from Sigma Aldrich  Device fabrication The ITO-coated transparent conducting substrate was

of DMF and DMSO ( v/v  4:1 )  A compact 25-nm thin SnO2 layer was spin-coated on the glass/ITO substrates  the details could be found elsewhere10  And then  the 08 M CsPbI3-precursor solution was deposited by a one-step spin-coating process onto the transport layer at the speed of 1500 rpm for 45 s Other compositions of inorganic perovskite films were also used for fabrication of devices to show that our SCG method is a universal approach  For CsPbI2Br solution  08 M CsI mixed with 04 M PbI2 and 04 M PbBr2 were dissolved in DMF and DMSO solvent  For CsPb ( I085Br015 ) 3 solution  085 M CsPbI3 and 015 M CsPbBr3 were mixed  For CsPbBr3 solution  04 M of CsBr : PbBr2 ( 1:1 ) was dissolved in DMF and DMSO solvent  For SCG of the perovskite layer  we dried the fresh spin-coated perovskite precursor films in a glove box  ranging from 0 to 50 min  After drying  the precursor films were annealed at 350 °C for 10 min in nitrogen glove box for the formation of α-phase CsPbI3 ( the annealing temperature of CsPbBr3 is 250 °C )  For conventional growth without SCG  after spin-coating of perovskite precursor films  annealing was carried out immediately  After cooling of the annealed perovskite films  the Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer was applied by spin-coating at 2500 rpm for 30 s A total of 1 mL of Spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene solution contained 723 mg Spiro-OMeTAD with the addition of 35 μL lithium bis ( trifluoromethanesulphonyl ) imide/acetonitrile ( 260 mg mL−1 ) and 30 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine  Eventually  60 nm of gold electrode was thermally evaporated on top of the device through a shadow mask  with an effective area of 0108 cm2  Characterization UV–vis spectra were carried out on a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer  SEM measurements were measured with FEI NanoSEM650 to get the relevant parameters  including the morphology and composition of the films  additionally  also includes the device structures  The XRD patterns ( θ–2θ scans ) were recorded with a Rigaku D/MAX-2500 system operated Cu Kα ( λ = 15405 Å ) at 40 kV and 200 mA  Steady PL measurement was carried out by Nanolog TCSPC ( USA )  TRPL were carried out by Edinburgh Instruments F900 ( UK )  During XRD and PL measurement  to avoid degradation of the films  the films were spin-coated with PMMA for protection  the concentration of the PMMA solution was 8 % in chlorobenzene  and the spin rate was 2000 rpm  UPS measurements were conducted on a Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi using HeI ( 2122 eV ) radiation lines  XPS were also carried out on the Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi with 200 W monochromated Al Kα ( 14866 eV ) radiation  and the XPS analysis using a 500 μm X-ray spot  Current–voltage characteristics of the photovoltaic devices were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter under a simulated AM 15G spectrum and a solar simulator ( Enli Tech  Taiwan )  before each measurement  the solar simulator was calibrated with a Si solar cell ( KG-5 )  The I–V measurements were carried out in nitrogen glove box  The devices are both measured in reverse scan ( 12 to 0 V  step 002 V ) and forward scan ( 0 to 12 V  step 002 V )  the photovoltaic devices were measured in both forward scan and reverse scan at a scan rate of 002 V s−1  The devices were taken out for EQE measurement  the EQE were measured by Enli Tech ( Taiwan ) EQE measurement system  Devices were encapsulated by the UV-epoxy and use-edge encapsulation method  For our best devices  we encapsulated the devices and then sent to PV calibration laboratory ( Newport  an accredited PV calibration laboratory  USA ) for certification  and during testing  a metal mask with the size of 00738 cm2 has been used  For shelf-stability test  we stored the solar cells in nitrogen glove box and measured it intermittently  and we collected the shelf-stability in 720 h For the photostability test  the devices were soaked under continuous one-sun condition with UV cut filter ( AM 15G  100 mW cm−2  420 nm cut filter )  the J–V curves were collected every several hours  and we collected the device s photostability in 500 h The photostability test was also carried out

January 2019 1 Introduction Terahertz waves are considered as the electromagnetic spectrum which frequency ranges from 01 to 10 THz  lying between the microwave and infrared regions  With the commercialization of terahertz wave sources and detectors  terahertz wave attracted significant attention because of the unique properties of terahertz radiation and has been extensively investigated  In recent years  there have been a growing interest in the development of the terahertz wave technology which has explored many potential applications in security screening  military detection  radio astronomy  high-bit-rate free-space communication  material science  nondestructive imaging  chemical and biological sensing  and medical diagnosis [ 1234 ]  These interests have highlighted the need for numerous functional devices and components for controlling and manipulating terahertz waves  many of which are still lacking  More recently  as a dispensable device for information processing at terahertz wave communication and surveillance  terahertz wave modulator has become a hot pursuit  There have reported various approaches for the development of terahertz wave modulators such as mechanical chopper [ 5 ]  liquid crystal [ 6 ]  two-dimensional electron gas [ 7 ]  photonic crystals [ 8 ]  semiconductor-based metamaterials [ 91011 ]  graphene [ 121314 ]  phase transition materials [ 15 ]  and organic materials [ 1617181920 ]  For example  Wen et al  [ 21 ] proposed all-optical graphene terahertz modulator with modulation speed of 200 kHz  Rodriguez et al  [ 22 ] designed all-electronics graphene terahertz modulator with modulation speed of 4 kHz  Unlu et al  [ 23 ] fabricated a terahertz modulator based on MEMS with modulation speed of 20 kHz  Liu et al  [ 24 ] measured a metamaterial/graphene terahertz modulator with modulation speed of 40 MHz  However  most of the terahertz wave modulator structures are too complex to limit their processing and applications  It has proved challenging to achieve high-speed modulation with a high modulation depth across a broad bandwidth of terahertz frequencies and is required for further research  Recently  we note that the perovskite materials have attracted wide attention and extensively used in optoelectronic device applications including next-generation solar cells [ 25  26 ]  light-emitting diodes ( LEDs ) [ 27  28 ]  lasers [ 29 ]  and photodetectors [ 30  31 ] due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties  such as tunable bandgap [ 323334 ]  long carrier lifetimes  extra-long carrier transport distances  high carrier mobilities  high light absorption coefficients  low cost  and tunable optoelectronic characteristics [ 3536373839 ]  Thus  CsPbX3 quantum dots ( QDs ) and CsPbX3 nanosheets have been demonstrated [ 404142 ]  Meanwhile  owing to their unique characteristics  two-dimensional CsPbX3 perovskites with QDs structure also offer a route for efficient manipulation of terahertz wave transmission due to the difference in their ionic nature and excellent optoelectronic properties compared with the traditional colloidal QDs  In this paper  we have proposed and demonstrated a high efficient terahertz wave modulator using CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots heterostructure  The signal modulation mechanism of the terahertz wave modulator is based on the absorption of photo-induced carriers which can be controlled by an external continuous wave ( CW ) laser  Experimental results show that the presented terahertz wave modulator has high extinction ratio  simplicity  small size  and easy fabrication  which make our designs promising for a wide range of application  especially in terahertz imaging and communication systems  2 Device design and fabrication The terahertz modulator architecture was fabricated with the configuration shown in Fig  1a  The CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots deposited onto a 360 µm-thick  high-resistivity ( > 1000 Ω cm ) Si wafer with ∼ 150 nm ( 2 ml of CsPbBr3 precursor solution made in the first process was added into spinning toluene ( 10 ml ) solution under vigorous stirring speed of 2000 rpm/min  and the adding rate was 01 ml/s )  The absorption coefficient of CsPbBr3 perovskite is 7 × 104 cm−1 [ 43 ]  Figure 1b depicts the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) image of the device with the scale of 10 µm recorded by an electron microscope ( JEOL  JSM-7800F  Japan )  It is observed that the interface between CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots  The morphologies of the synthesized CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots were further confirmed by transmission electron microscope ( TEM ) with the scale of 50 nm  as shown in Fig  1c  For characterization of CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots  the absorption and photoluminance are measured by Omin λ300 grating spectrometer  Figure 1d shows that purified CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots that employed centrifugation with alcohol as antisolvent exhibit highly stable and bright luminescence  The CsPbBr3 exhibits absorption peak at 510 nm  from which the optical band energy are determined to be 225 eV  Figure 2 shows the schematic experimental configuration used for terahertz modulation of CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots heterostructure  In our setup  backward-wave oscillator ( BWO ) is a CW terahertz wave emission source  and a two-dimensional controlled stage is used to control the location of the test CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots heterostructure sample  A zero-bias Schottky diode intensity detector is employed to measure the emitted terahertz power  A 450 nm continuous wave laser is mounted with a beam incident angle of 20° to the normal of the CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots heterostructure  In our experiment  the laser beam is expanded  The external pump laser beam has a maximum average power of 2 W/cm2 with a spot diameter of 3 mm so that it can overlap the terahertz beam diameter about 3 mm  Fig  1

spectrum of CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots Full size image Fig  2 figure 2 Schematic diagram of the proposed terahertz wave modulator  the continuous wave terahertz wave was generated using BWO and was guided through four polymethylpentene lenses  The 450 nm continuous wave laser illuminated the surface at an oblique angle of 20° Full size image The spectral transmission of CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dot heterostructure was measured by a BWO with and without the external 450 nm pump laser excitation at the frequency range from 023 to 035 THz  respectively  The amplitude spectrum of the CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots/Si under various laser intensity irradiances are depicted in Fig  3  To investigate the modulation mechanism in detail  we deduced the optical constants of the CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots/Si from the time–frequency spectral via BWO under various laser irradiances  Figure 4 shows the refractive index and the absorption coefficient of CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots/Si hybrid structure  The CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots can form a heterostructure with semiconductor Si due to their difference in bandgap and Fermi level  When the CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots/Si hybrid structure is under pump laser illumination  the photoexcited electrons and holes near the junction area are separated each other and drifted into different regions under the function of built-in electric field  Guided by previous work [ 44  45 ]  the Fermi level of perovskite quantum dot is different from that of silicon  and their valence band top and condition band bottom are different  Then  p–n heterojunction ( n perovskite  p type silicon ) is formed on the interface  and the internal electric field is built due to the electron–hole drift diffusion equilibrium  Since the photo-carrier mobility of perovskite ( on the order of 10 ) is a factor of ~ 100 less than that of silicon ( on the order of 103 )  causing an accumulation of photocarriers at the CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots/silicon interface  subsequently  an increase in the terahertz wave photo-induced absorption  Higher concentration of carriers can be aggregated under this mechanism and finally realize a high modulation-depth  This can be explained by the fact that the photo-doping on CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots/Si hybrid structure by external pump laser in our experiment changed the dielectric property  Fig  3 figure 3 Spectrum of the CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots heterostructure with various laser intensity irradiances Full size image Fig  4 figure 4 Frequency-dependent

CsPbBr3 layer is much less than the terahertz wavelength  CsPbBr3 must be considered as a boundary condition with a surface conductivity σ ( ω ) as follows [ 46 ] sigma ( omega ) = { { left [ { frac { { 4 cdot n ( omega ) } } { { T ( omega ) cdot ( n ( omega ) +1 ) } } exp left ( { - j ( n ( omega ) - 1 ) { k_0 } d } right ) - 1 - n ( omega ) } right ] } mathord { left/ { vphantom { { left [ { frac

} } }  ( 2 ) When Fabry–Perot resonance takes an integer value  then Eq  ( 2 ) must be solved numerically in terms of the surface conductivity  As shown in Fig  4  one sees that the real part of the refractive index of the CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots/Si hybrid structure increases a little as the laser irradiance increases ( see Fig  4a )  but the absorption coefficient of the CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots/Si hybrid structure sharply increases from 008 to 024 µm−1 at the frequency range from 023 to 035 THz  causing the corresponding high terahertz modulation  According to the Drude model  the frequency dependent complex dielectric constant in CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots/Si hybrid structure is given bytilde { varepsilon } ( omega ) = { varepsilon _infty } +frac { { isigma } } { { omega { varepsilon _0 } } } = { varepsilon _infty } - frac { { omega _ { { { text { pe } } } } ^ { 2 } } } { { omega ( omega +i { Gamma _ { text { e } } } ) } } - frac { { omega _ { { { text { ph } } } } ^ { 2 } } } { { omega ( omega +i { Gamma _ { text { h } } } ) } }  where ε∞ is the contribution of the dielectric and the parameter indices e and h refer to electrons and holes  respectively  Γe/h = 1/τe/h is the damping rate with τe/h the average collision time  The plasma angular frequency ɷp ( e/h ) is defined by ɷ2p ( e/h ) = Ne/ε0me/h  where N is the carrier density  e is the electronic charge  ε0 is the free-space permittivity  and me/h is the effective carrier mass  The damping rate Γe/h is obtained from the mobility by Γe/h = e/ ( me/h/µe/h )  Without laser irradiance  the carrier density in CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots/Si interface is very low  and the dielectric constant of CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots/Si hybrid structure is real number and equals to ε∞  When the CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots/Si is optically excited  a large number of free carriers are generated and then high free carrier concentrations are accumulated at the interface between silicon and quantum dots  That is to say  when the numerical value of ɷ2p ( e/h ) is larger than that of ɷ2 + ɷΓe/h  the real part of the dielectric constant in CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots/Si interface becomes negative  At this time  the imaginary part of the dielectric constant in CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots/Si hybrid structure can not be ignored  Since the imaginary part of the dielectric constant is corresponding to the absorption coefficient  the transmission terahertz wave is attenuated  3 Experimental results Here  we used the measurement set-up ( see Fig  2 ) for dynamic modulation characteristics test of the proposed device  The system consists of a Microtech Instruments BWO continuous wave terahertz source with a central output in the 270 GHz  and a 230–400 GHz zero-bias Schottky diode intensity detector  The average output power of the terahertz source is 10 mW  In this measurement  a square-wave voltage was used to drive the 450 nm CW diode laser to produce pump beam with the power alternating between zero and 2 W/cm2  The modulator sample is placed in front of an open-ended BWO waveguide  and the transmitted signals are measured with a Schottky diode intensity detector  Figure 5 shows the detected modulation speed voltage signal of the presented terahertz wave modulator for different modulation frequencies at room temperature of 25 °C ( The terahertz wave frequency is set to be 027 THz )  From Fig  5a  c  one sees that the transmission amplitude of terahertz wave decreases with the increase of modulation frequency  The detected energy spectra ( Tektronix Signal  Spectrum  and Modulation Analyzers ) are plotted in Fig  5b  d for different modulation frequencies  As illustrated in Fig  5b  the power of the modulation signal peak is − 109 dBm  which is larger than that of the noise power of the absorption peaks about 10 dBm  At 25 MHz  the device still has a response to the photoexcitation with signal peak power of − 103 dBm but the signal larger than noise level ( − 132 dBm )  Furthermore  as the CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots absorption spectrum is broadband in nature and only silicon material is involved  our proposed modulator scheme may have practical applications in the terahertz wave integrated circuit fields  Fig  5 figure 5 Modulated terahertz beam signal for a carrier wave frequency of 027 THz with different modulation frequency Full size image 4 Summary We demonstrated the design  fabrication  and characterization of a terahertz wave modulator based on CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots heterostructure  We measured the modulation of the terahertz transmission in the frequency range from 023 to 035 THz  The optical properties in terahertz band of the CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots heterostructure are extracted via BWO system  By an external 450 nm laser pump irradiance of 20 W/cm2  dynamic experiments at 027 THz evidence that CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots heterostructure provides a modulation speed of 25 MHz and the modulation depth of 455 %  The major advantage of this device is its high modulation efficiency  high speed  low-cost  easy integration and stability  which assure that this device can be a good candidate for future a practical terahertz wave communication systemPerovskite/silicon tandem solar cells promise power conversion efficiencies beyond the Shockley–Queisser limit of single-junction devices ; however  their actual outdoor performance is yet to be investigated  Here we fabricate 25 % efficient two-terminal monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells and test them outdoors in a hot and sunny climate  We find that the temperature dependence of both the silicon and perovskite bandgaps—which follow opposing trends—shifts the devices away from current matching for two-terminal tandems that are optimized at standard test conditions  Consequently  we argue that the optimal perovskite bandgap energy at standard test conditions is < 168 eV for field performance at operational temperatures greater than 55 °C  which is lower compared with earlier findings  This implies that bromide-lean perovskites with narrower bandgaps at standard test conditions—and therefore better phase stability—hold great promise for the commercialization of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cellsayered perovskites have been shown to improve the stability of perovskite solar cells while its operation mechanism remains unclear  Here we investigate the process for the conversion of light to electrical current in high performance layered perovskite solar cells by examining its real morphology  The layered perovskite films in this study are found to be a mixture of layered and three dimensional ( 3D ) -like phases with phase separations at micrometer and nanometer scale in both vertical and lateral directions  This phase separation is explained by the surface initiated crystallization process and the competition of the crystallization between 3D-like and layered perovskites  We further propose that the working mechanisms of the layered perovskite solar cells involve energy transfer from layered to 3D-like perovskite network  The impact of morphology on efficiency and stability of the hot-cast layered perovskite solar cells are also discussed to provide guidelines for the future improvement  Similar content being viewed by others

in Patterning Strategies for Full-Color Perovskite Light-Emitting Diodes Article Open access 07 December 2023 Introduction Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites ( OIHPs ) have emerged as the most promising low-temperature solution-processable photovoltaic materials due to their intriguing properties like long carrier diffusion length  large absorption coefficient and low bulk trap density123  Despite the significant improvement in power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) achieved in the past few years4  the concern on the poor stability  especially the moisture stability  of OIHP materials remains a major hurdle for the commercialization of the OIHP solar cells5  The low stability stems mainly from the low formation_energy and hydroscopic nature of the OIHP materials6  One approach to address the poor moisture stability of three-dimensional ( 3D ) perovskite devices is to introduce layered OIHPs  or quasi-two-dimensional ( 2D ) perovskites  which contain sheets of 3D perovskites sandwiched by long organic ligands  The hydrophobic ligands can slow down the permeation of moisture into the lead iodide octahedron  and thus impede the decomposition of the OIHPs by moisture78  Since the photovoltaic devices fabricated by layered perovskite materials exhibit impressively better stability in some cases  these materials have recently attracted intensive attention  despite that their PCEs are still much lower than the 3D perovskite counterparts78910  The further PCE improvement of layered perovskite solar cells relies on better understanding of their operation mechanism  which  however  remains largely elusive up to now  Tsai et al9 reported that the layered perovskite film fabricated with hot-casting spin-coating method showed the preferential alignment of the layered crystallographic planes along the out-of-plane direction  and assigned the high mobility in the crystallographic planes of the inorganic perovskite components is the main reason for the efficient charge carrier extraction and thus high PCE above 12 % in layered perovskite solar cells  Nevertheless  the underlying working mechanism for solar cells involving layered perovskites is still not clear  For example  the morphology  phase compositions and distribution are not known yet for the perovskite thin films prepared with a composition for layered perovskites  Liu et al11 observed very different photoluminescence ( PL ) properties from the top and bottom film surface  which was explained by different layered perovskite phases with increasing n values naturally aligned along the vertical direction to the substrate  In addition  it is still an open question of how the photogenerated excitons efficiently dissociate in layered perovskites with exciton binding energy much larger than thermal energy at room temperature121314  Blancon et al15 proposed that the low energy edge states in layered perovskites can facilitate exciton dissociation  However  a full picture of exciton diffusion to edge states and free charge carrier extraction is still missing  For a better understanding of the working principle of layered perovskite solar cells  in this study  we carefully examine the morphology of the hot-cast layered perovskite thin films at both microscopic and nanoscopic scales  The results show that layered perovskite thin films comprise multiple layered perovskite phases surrounded by 3D-like perovskites  The layered flakes are much smaller than the thin film thickness  Based on the observed morphology  we propose a model for the operation of realistic layered perovskite solar cells which involves energy transfer from layered to 3D-like perovskites and charge collection through the 3D-like perovskite network  Results Material preparation and device evaluation Achieving efficient layered perovskite solar cells is essential to establish the material platform for investigating the working mechanism  In this study  layered perovskite films with a nominal composition of ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) 3Pb4I13 ( BA = CH3 ( CH2 ) 3NH3+ ; MA = CH3NH3+ ) were fabricated by hot-casting method  The precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving specific stoichiometric quantities of n-butylammonium iodide ( BAI )  methylammonium iodide ( MAI ) and PbI2 in N  N-dimethylformamide ( DMF )  The X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) pattern of layered perovskite films is shown in Fig  1a  Three diffraction peaks at 1420°  2848° and 4328° were well resolved  which match the diffraction peak positions of ( bar 11bar 1 )  ( 202 ) and ( 313 ) crystallographic planes from layered perovskite ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) 3Pb4I13  respectively9  However  the diffraction peaks of ( 110 )  ( 220 ) and ( 314 ) crystallographic planes from 3D perovskite MAPbI3 located at 1405°  2845° and 4313° or ( bar 11bar 1 )  ( 202 ) and ( 313 ) crystallographic planes from layered perovskite ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) n-1PbnI3n+1 ( n = 2  3 ) also agreed with the XRD pattern quite well161718  The calculated diffraction angle 2θ values of layered perovskites ( n = 2 to 4 ) were summarized ( Supplementary Table 1  Supplementary Note 2 )  The difference of 2θ values between the same crystallographic planes of ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) n-1PbnI3n+1 ( n = 2 to 4 ) are within 012°  which are negligible compared to the FWHM ( full width at half maximum ) of the diffraction peaks ( greater than 045° for the XRD result presented here )  making it even more difficult to index the different perovskite phases  There are not clear peaks at diffraction angles ( 2θ ) below 14° which are characteristic of low-angle { 010 } reflections in layered crystals18  In order to further determine the phase composition  XRD measurements of scraped powder of thin films were also conducted  Several extra diffraction peaks are present in powder XRD pattern ( Supplementary Figure 1 )  After comparing it with the XRD patterns of 3D perovskite powders  we concluded that these high-angle diffraction peaks more likely originate from 3D perovskites  indicating the coexistence of layered and 3D-like perovskite phases in layered perovskite films  Weak diffraction peaks at low-angle ( less than 14° ) can be observed in the powder XRD spectrum ; the absence of such peaks in layered perovskite thin film samples might be explained by the small amount of randomly oriented layered perovskite phases present  Exciton-like absorption peaks at 194 eV ( n = 4 ) and 205 eV ( n = 3 ) in Fig  1b indicate the films prepared from mixed precursor solution contain layered perovskites11  The blue-shift of absorption in the long wavelength region from 3D-like perovskite phase may be ascribed to quantum confinement effect of small perovskite crystallites produced by bulking amine ligands effect  and similar results have been reported elsewhere1920  As the scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) image shown in Fig  1c reveals  uniform  pinhole-free and compact layered perovskite films were obtained by the hot-casting technique  The photovoltaic devices were fabricated with a structure of indium tin oxide ( ITO ) /poly ( bis ( 4-phenyl ) ( 246-trimethylphenyl ) amine ) ( PTAA ) /layered perovskites/ [ 66 ] -phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) /C60/29-dimethyl-47-diphenyl-110-phenanthroline ( BCP ) /Cu as shown in Fig  1d  A reasonably high PCE of 127 % was recorded from current density-voltage ( J-V ) scanning  as shown in Fig  1e  with an open-circuit voltage ( VOC ) of 113 V  short-circuit current density ( JSC ) of 1890 mA cm−2 and fill factor ( FF ) of 59 %  The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) and integrated JSC are shown in Fig  1f  The integrated JSC of 1857 mA cm−2 agrees well with the measured JSC from J-V scanning  The layered perovskite thin films used for the morphology investigation in this study were fabricated with the same method as those in our high PCE layered perovskite solar cells  Fig  1 figure 1 Characterization of layered

anisotropic mobility studies  The layered perovskite single crystals were synthesized following the liquid phase crystallization method ( Fig  2a  left panel )  Typically  for layered ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) 2Pb3I10 single crystal with n = 3  lead ( II ) iodide  n-butylamine and methylammonium iodide in appropriate molar ratios were dissolved in hydriodic acid solvent by heating  Subsequently  the hot solution was slowly cooled to room temperature and layered perovskite ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) 2Pb3I10 single crystal platelets can be obtained at the solution–air interface ( Fig  2a  right panel )  The XRD pattern ( Fig  2b ) revealed three low-angle diffraction peaks between 2θ = 5 and 14°  which were indexed to be ( 040 )  ( 060 ) and ( 080 ) crystallographic planes of layered perovskite ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) 2Pb3I10 ( n = 3 )  The calculated d-spacing matches the distance between the discrete perovskite layers in ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) 2Pb3I10 { 010 } reflection ( Supplementary Table 2  also see Supplementary Note 2 ) 18  The optical absorption properties of the mechanically exfoliated layered perovskite single crystals ( n = 3 ) are shown in Fig  2c  The main exciton peak position  the onset of band-to-band absorption and the estimated exciton binding energy agree with previously reported results15  Fig  2 figure 2 Layered perovskite single crystals synthesis and characterization  a ( left

Morphology of hot-cast layered perovskite thin films The features of the absorption spectra of the hot-cast layered perovskite thin films indicate the presence of multiple phases of layered perovskites  The results from grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering ( GIWAXS ) show further evidence of multiple phases and/or orientations ( Supplementary Figure 2  Supplementary Figure 3 and Supplementary Note 1 )  As an exercise  the indexing of peaks from both layered perovskites ( n = 4 ) and 3D-like perovskite phases suggest that both layered and 3D-like perovskites could be present at certain orientations in the samples  Furthermore  as indicated by the few unindexed peaks  other phases/orientations are likely present as well besides these specific layered ( n = 4 ) and 3D-like phases  To obtain an in-depth understanding of the morphology of the layered perovskite thin films  we investigated the distribution  size and orientation of the layered perovskite phases using a combination of nanoscopic- and microscopic-level morphology characterizations  Vertical phase segregation First  the incident-angle-dependent photoluminescence was adopted to investigate the distribution of layered perovskite phases along the out-of-plane direction  Here  by changing the incident angle  we can control the penetration depth of the excitation laser into perovskite films ( Fig  3a )  The PL measurement was conducted under two different excitation configurations  ie  the incident laser beam with wavelength of 405 nm illuminated the perovskite films either from the air ( front ) side or the glass ( back ) side  as illustrated in the insets of Fig  3b and Fig  3c  and the corresponding PL spectra are shown in Fig  3b and Fig  3c  respectively  For both front and back excitations  the PL spectra show several emission peaks  agreeing with the absorption spectra results and GIWAXS indications that the layered perovskite films comprise multiple perovskite phases and orientations  Five PL peaks at 576 nm  615 nm  650 nm  673 nm and 750 nm were observed  The PL peak at 750 nm can be assigned to 3D-like perovskites15  The blue-shift of this peak compared to the PL peak of pure 3D perovskites which regularly locate at a position of 780 nm may also be ascribed to the quantum confinement effect  We observed that the film thickness has an obvious effect on this peak position  which shows a blue-shift with the reducing film thickness  as shown in Supplementary Figure 4  After comparing these PL peaks with previous reports  the higher energy PL peaks at 576 nm  615 nm  650 nm and 673 nm can be assigned to emission from ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) n-1PbnI3n+1 perovskites with n = 2  3  4 and 5  respectively11  The PL intensity had been normalized according to the intensity of the 750 nm emission peak  Fig  3 figure 3 Vertical and lateral phase segregation investigation  a Schematic of incident-angle dependent photoluminescence ( PL ) setup  b The incident-angle-dependent PL spectra of the layered perovskite films illuminated from the front sides ( as illustrated in the inset ) of the films  c The incident-angle-dependent PL spectra of the

are labeled with pink and black squares  respectively  f Absorption spectra measured in the bright and dark area labeled in e The size of the measured area is 06 × 06 µm2  smaller than the labeled area Full size image The PL intensity ratio between different emission peaks obtained with different incident angles suggested that the distribution of different phases of layered perovskites was not uniform along the out-of-plane direction in the films  Under front excitation with incident light angle ( the angle between the incident ray and the normal direction ) of 89°  the incident laser at wavelength of 405 nm has the smallest penetration depth of 577 nm ( the estimation of penetration depths was summarized in Supplementary Table 3 )  PL intensity of the dominant emission peak at 750 nm is 10 times stronger than those of 3 other emission peaks  With decreasing the incident angle and increasing penetration depth of excitation light  PL intensities from perovskite phases with n = 2  3 and 4 gradually increase  Under back excitation with penetration of 649 nm  PL intensities of the emission from perovskite phases with n = 2 to 5 are comparable to that of perovskite phases with n ≈ ∞  The difference of PL spectra between front excitation and back excitation and different excitation depths imply that the layered perovskite phases with smaller n prefer to stay at the bottom  while the large n layered or 3D-like perovskite phases tend to stay close to the surface of the films  This is consistent with the previous study by Liu et al11  The film thickness could have an effect on such graded distribution along vertical direction reported in previous work  and thicker films exhibit more dramatic difference in phase distribution throughout the sample thickness ( as shown in Supplementary Figure 4 ) 21  Lateral phase segregation After identifying the nonuniform distributions of layered perovskite and 3D-like perovskite phases in vertical direction  we conducted the optical transmission mapping measurement to study their lateral distributions by leveraging the differences between the absorption spectra of layered and 3D perovskites  As shown in Fig  3d  3D perovskite has much stronger absorption than layered perovskites in the wavelength range between 680 nm and 770 nm  In the transmission mode  the incident light with wavelength less than 650 nm will be filtered after applying a 650 nm long pass filter  Therefore  the area with more layered perovskite phases appear brighter as less incoming light can be absorbed  In contrast  the area with more 3D perovskite phase appears darker in the transmission mapping images  For the hot-cast layered perovskite thin films  dendrite structure with the size in the range of several to tens of micrometers were observed  indicating the nonuniform distribution of different perovskite phases in the lateral direction ( Fig  3e )  By further comparing the absorption spectra of the dark and bright area ( Fig  3f )  we conclude that the dark areas correspond to 3D-like perovskite phase while the bright areas correspond to layered perovskite phases  and layered perovskites was surrounded by 3D-like perovskites  Morphology at the atomic scale After identifying the nonuniform distribution of multiple layered perovskite phases in both vertical and lateral directions  we further studied their size and orientation with high-resolution transmission electron microscope ( HRTEM )  The HRTEM images  as well as associated fast-Fourier transforms ( FFT )  of the thin film ’ s cross-section shown in Fig  4  convey a better picture of the overall morphology of the real layered films  In Fig  4b  the 14 Å lattice spacing corresponds to the BA2PbI4 ( n = 1 ) phase  Most of these layered domains have sizes in the range of several to tens of nanometers  much smaller than the film thickness  Surrounding the BA2PbI4 ( n = 1 )  the narrower plane spacing of 31 Å indicates the presence of 3D MAPbI3  HRTEM allows us direct observation of the orientation of the layered perovskites  Very careful sample preparation utilizing the focused ion beam lift-out procedure is required to obtain a clear HRTEM image  Figure 4b  c shows two typical HRTEM cross-sectional images at locations close to and away from the substrates  To reveal the orientation distribution of the layered perovskite phases  we randomly chose 25 areas of layered perovskite phases for HRTEM study  The results are shown in Fig  4d  Here  θ is the angle between the substrate and ( 001 ) planes of layered perovskites  Thus  90˚ and 0˚ represent that the layered perovskite layer is perpendicular to and parallel with the substrate  respectively  From Fig  4d  there might be apparent preferred orientation of the layered perovskite regions  but one would need more HRTEM images for better statistics  Fig  4 figure 4 High-resolution transmission electron microscope ( HRTEM ) images of cross-section of the spin-coated BA2MA3Pb4I13

 d Statistical distribution of the angle θ between substrate and layered perovskites Full size image Model of growth kinetics and device operation mechanism A model of film formation mechanism is proposed to explain the observed morphology  ie  the presence of both vertical and lateral phase segregation  and with most of layered domains with sizes in the range of several to tens of nanometers are surrounded by 3D-like perovskites  In the hot-casting process  hot precursor solution was casted on a hot spinning substrate  It is highly likely that the precursor solution at the liquid–air interface would reach supersaturation first due to the fast evaporation of DMF solvent at the surface  which has been confirmed by a top-crust scraping test22  As shown in Fig  5a  b and Supplementary Movie 1  we find that 3D-like crystal tends to first precipitate prior to layered perovskites  This is a similar top-crust peeling-off test but using precursor material for layered perovskites of n = 4  The fact that black shell first formed proves that 3D-like crystals are more easily to form  otherwise the shell would be dark-red colored for n = 4 layered perovskites  As shown in Fig  5c  a PL peak at 762 nm was probed for the formed shell  which can be assigned to 3D-like perovskites  The consumption of much less BA in top 3D-like perovskite layer actually pushes more BA toward the substrate side so that the ratio of BA to MA gradually increased in the leftover solution  The more BA-rich solution accelerates the layered perovskite nucleus formation and allows the formation of layered perovskites  though there is still a competition of 3D-like perovskites and layered perovskites  Actually PL emissions from bottom layer after peeling off the top-crust or excite from glass substrate side show the presence of layered perovskites with n = 2 to 4  a group of layered perovskites with much large n values and 3D-like ( n → ∞ ) perovskites in the film crystallized from the leftover precursor solution underneath the top-crust  Fig  5 figure 5 Optical images and photoluminescence ( PL ) spectra of top-crust peeling-off test  a Schematics of top-crust peeling-off test setup  A glass substrate ( 40 mm × 50 mm ) with 100 µL BA2MA3Pb4I13 precursor solution ( 2 M in N  N-dimethylformamide ( DMF ) ) on top was placed on a hot plate at 70 °C  The yellow solution begun to turn dark in the edge  and this dark area gradually spread into the center as indicated by the red arrows  forming a top-crust  b A Kapton tape was used to partially peel off the top-crust  and the revealed yellow precursor solution underneath that has not yet crystallized started to turn red under heating  After the solution had dried  the glass substrate was removed from the hot plate  The area inside the white frame represented the crystallized front surface revealed after the top-crust was removed by Kapton tape  c PL spectrum of different areas in b Full size image This basically explains the observed vertical phase separation with more layered perovskite with smaller n towards the substrate site  and lateral phase separation in both micrometer and nanometer scales  This size of layered perovskite grains is limited by how fast the BA ligands can diffuse to the site for layered perovskite growth  and the competition of 3D-like and layered perovskites may interrupt the growth of large grain layered perovskites  as evidenced by the HRTEM images  The competition of 3D-like and layered perovskite formation also indicates that the film morphology should be very sensitive to the process condition such as temperature or solvent drying speed  This is again supported by the study of layered perovskite formation by slowing down the 3D perovskite formation by adding dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone ( NMP ) to the precursor solution  DMSO in precursor solution has been shown to promote the layered perovskite growth23  which is also observed here by the much strong PL emission from the layered perovskites in both front and back side of the films  and clear XRD peaks at low diffraction angle ( Supplementary Figure 5  Supplementary Note 3 )  This basically can be explained by the slowed-down 3D perovskite formation by DMSO or NMP due to the formation of intermediate phases  Sargent and colleagues21 have reported the observation of intermediate phase in reduced-dimensional metal halide perovskites when DMSO/NMP is used in solutions  This might also arise from differences in the solubility of the cation ( BA or MA ) in the different solvents  Based on the optical  XRD and HRTEM results discussed above  the growth kinetics and morphology of layered perovskite thin films fabricated by hot-casting is summarized in Fig  6  The 3D-like crystal tends to precipitate first  As more and more 3D-like crystals precipitated  the ratio of BA to MA in leftover solution gradually increased and the BA-rich solution facilitated the afterward layered perovskite nucleus formation  As layered perovskite grains grew up  the BA/MA ratio in the surrounding solution gradually decreased and such MA-rich solution will again facilitate the 3D-like perovskite nucleation and growth  forming the morphology that layered perovskite grains with size of several to tens of nm were embedded in 3D-like perovskite network which agrees quite well with the atomic-scale morphology that we observed in HRTEM results  The spatial distribution of these layered perovskites was nonuniform in both vertical and lateral directions  and more layered perovskite phases with small n tend to segregate close to the substrate  Fig  6 figure 6 Growth kinetics  morphology and device operation mechanism model  a–c The growth kinetics and morphology model  d The device structure is indium tin oxide ( ITO ) /hole transport layer ( HTL ) /layered perovskite film/electron transport layer ( ETL ) /metal electrode Full size image From the morphology scenario directly observed  we proposed a model for the operation of perovskite solar cells with layered perovskites ( Fig  6d ) : To contribute to the PCE of layered perovskite solar cells  the excitons generated in layered perovskite phases need to go through the layered/3D-like perovskite interface via a charge transfer or energy transfer  The transient absorption measurements were performed with the layered perovskite thin films ( n = 4 )  The samples were excited from the back side ( glass side ) by a 20 μJ cm−2 570 nm pump beam  As shown in Supplementary Figure 6  the TA signals with a negative sign around 572 nm  604 nm  639 nm and 704 nm are attributed to the resonance of n = 2  3  4  and 3D-like phase  respectively  For 3D-like and high n number 2D ( n > 3 ) phases  the red-shift of the peak wavelength is caused by hot carrier cooling as the excitation energy is far above their bandgap  Growth of the 3D-like perovskite bleach peak and fast decay dynamics at 572 nm and 604 nm suggests an energy/charge transfer process between small n number 2D phase and 3D-like perovskite phase  According to previous studies2425  we speculate that the energy transfer is more dominant in this system  because the transfer process happens at a very early delay time scale ( far before 500 ps )  We speculate energy transfer from the larger bandgap layered perovskites to lower bandgap 3D-like perovskites across the ligands  The layered flakes observed in our study were generally few layers  and thus we expect most of energy may be transferred to 3D-like perovskites  After energy transfer  excitons are generated in 3D-like perovskites  which will dissociate into free charge quickly due to the very small exciton binding energy in 3D-like perovskites  Thus  the transport and collection of free charge carriers was dominated by 3D-like perovskite phase which form a percolation network in layered perovskite solar cells  Carrier transport in layered perovskite solar cells One way to verify whether photogenerated charges go through 3D-like perovskite phase to be collected is to measure the charge extraction time needed for both the 3D and layered perovskites with a thickness of the devices  In view of the layered structure of layered perovskites and the insulating nature of the long chain organic cations  it is intuitively assumed by us that there would be large conductivity anisotropy along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions  However  there is no study yet to find out whether the long organic ligands really inhibit the out-of-plane carrier transport properties  Here we used ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) 2Pb3I10 ( n = 3 ) single crystals ( SCs ) as a model system to measure the carrier mobility along these two directions with the space charge limited current ( SCLC ) method  Hole-only and electron-only devices were fabricated by sandwiching the layered perovskite SC between Au electrodes or C60/bathocuproine ( BCP ) /Cu electrodes  respectively  because of the large electron ( hole ) injection barrier at the layered perovskite/Au ( C60/BCP/Cu ) interface  For the out-of-plane mobility measurement  a gap larger than the crystal thickness is intentionally left between the electrode edge and the crystal edge when depositing the electrodes on the crystals  to avoid the influence of possible edge conductance of the crystal  as schematically shown in the inset of Fig  7a  The device dark current density ( J ) as a function of bias ( V ) of the vertical structured hole-only device is shown in Fig  7a  which can be divided into Ohmic response region ( J propto V ) at the low bias  and the trap-filled SCLC region ( J propto V^2 ) under large bias  The J-V curve at the SCLC region can be well-fitted by the Mott–Gurney law : J = frac { { 9varepsilon varepsilon _0  mu V^2 } } { { 8L^3 } }  ( 1 ) where ε is the relative dielectric constant that equals to 5 for ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) 2Pb3I10  ε0 is the vacuum permittivity  μ is the carrier mobility and L is the distance between the electrodes  The hole mobility along the out-of-plane direction is fitted to be 15×10–4 cm2 V−1 s−1  which is comparable to carrier mobilities in organic semiconductors262728  The in-plane electron mobility derived from the J-V curve of the lateral-structured electron-only device is approximately 12 cm2 V−1 s−1  which is nearly four orders of magnitude larger than that along the out-of-plane direction  and is smaller but close to that of 3D perovskites ( Fig  7b )  For the electron-only vertically structured device  however  the J-V curve was dominated by the Ohmic region all the way up to the maximum bias applied  which made it difficult to derive the electron mobility along this direction  Nevertheless  the comparable conductivity at the Ohmic region for the hole-only and electron-only devices ( Supplementary Figure 7 ) indicates that the electron mobility and hole mobility of ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) 2Pb3I10 along the out-of-plane direction should be within the same order of magnitude  Fig  7 figure 7 Carrier mobility study in layered perovskite single crystals and thin films  Current density-voltage curves for a hole-only vertical

lateral devices  respectively  c Transient photocurrent ( TPC ) curves of layered perovskite thin film solar cells with decreased working area ( from C1 to C3 )  The inset is the measured RC time constant of the device as well as the fitted decay time of the TPC curves with different device working areas  The red lines are the fitting curves to the data Full size image The knowledge of the anisotropic mobility in layered perovskite crystals enabled us to determine the main charge transport path by measuring the carrier transit time in the layered perovskite thin films  Here  we used the transient photocurrent ( TPC ) method to measure the carrier transit time of the BA-based layered perovskite thin film solar cells ( with precursor composition of n = 4 ) with a device structure of ITO/PTAA/layered perovskite ( 550 nm thick ) /PCBM/C60/BCP/Cu  as shown in Fig  7c  For the TPC measurement  the RC constant of the device was carefully controlled to be smaller than the carrier transit time by reducing device area  The derived low limit for the mobility of the layered perovskite films from TPC was 02 cm2 V−1 s−1 by neglecting the transit time in other buffer layers  This mobility is comparable to the in-plane carrier mobility of layered perovskite SC  or measured mobility of polycrystalline 3D perovskite materials329  but much larger than that of layered perovskites along the out-of-plane direction  Since we do not see layered flakes are large enough to connect electron and hole transport layers  the results agree well with our scenario that the charge extraction process in the layered perovskite thin films is dominated by the 3D-like perovskite phase  Discussion The morphology observed in this study can help the understanding of the device efficiency limitation and stability enhancement in layered perovskite solar cells  The layered/3D-like mixture still allows the charge extraction out of the device through the 3D-like network if the film thickness is not too large  This generally explains the high EQE of 80 to 90 % achieved in the wavelength range of 400 to 650 nm  However  compared to the EQE spectrum of pure 3D perovskite solar cells  it is found that EQE within the wavelength range of 650 to 750 nm is much lower for the layered perovskite solar cells  This may be caused by the inefficient absorption of the incident photons at this wavelength range  or due to the less efficient energy transfer from the layered phases with larger n values to the 3D-like phase because of either the larger flakes or the smaller bandgap difference between them  This presents a challenge to efficiently harvesting the incident photon energies for the layered perovskite solar cells  which is the main reason that the JSC of the layered perovskite solar cells is lower than that of their 3D counterparts  Increasing the thickness of such films to enhance absorption generally does not always result in enhanced JSC  may be due to the fact that the layered perovskite flakes with non-ideal orientation embedded in 3D-like perovskite would still impede the charge transport and thus cause charge recombination  The VOC of layered perovskite solar cells should be limited by the smallest bandgap phase when the photoactive layer is a mixture of multiple phases with different band gaps  This is the reason that the obtained VOC of 113 V is comparable to the value widely achieved in 3D perovskite solar cells despite the layered perovskites has larger bandgap than their 3D counterpart  In terms of fill factor  it is much lower for the layered perovskite solar cells in comparison to the 3D counterparts  which may be caused by the increasing charge carrier recombination occurs at the layered/3D-like perovskite interface  Regarding the better environmental stability of layered perovskite solar cells observed in some cases  it is generally believed that this is mainly benefited from the protection of the organic ligand of the layered perovskite materials  However  the real morphology result shown here reveals that the layered perovskite films formed by hot-casting method is mainly composed of 3D-like perovskite phases with more 3D-like phases preferentially distributed on the top surface  It is intriguing to understand why their long-term stability can outperform the 3D counterparts in some cases  We speculate the enhanced stability of perovskite solar cells with addition of some 2D additive may be contributed by multiple factors  First of all  the organic ligands added in the precursor solution for layered perovskite formation must stay somewhere if they do not convert all the 3D perovskites into layered perovskites  They most likely will stay at grain boundaries which may contribute to the formation of more robust grain boundaries  Our recent studies showed that defective grain boundaries may initiate and facilitate the film degradation  because moisture  oxygen or constituting ions in perovskites can migrate much faster along them30  As a matter of fact  our previous study on the ion migration property of the layered perovskite films fabricated by the same method as reported here showed that the ion migration was largely suppressed up to 330 K in layered perovskite films both in dark and under illumination3132  This can significantly alleviate the ion migration-induced degradation of the perovskite layer  especially under illumination  Second  the addition of ligands for layered perovskites may also relieve the strain in the formed films and thus enhance the intrinsic stability of the films  The presence of lattice strain was recently observed by us in perovskite films formed through annealing process  and the lattice strain accelerates the degradation of perovskite films because ion migration in perovskite films is accelerated by the presence of strain33  The relief of strain can suppress the ion migration process and thus improve the photo-stability of MAPbI3 thin films  We propose that the better stability of layered perovskite solar cells may also have contribution from the less-strained perovskite layer in comparison to the pure 3D perovskite films  which is confirmed by the very small XRD peak shift between the layered perovskite film on substrate and the freestanding strain-free perovskite powders scratched from the substrate ( see Supplementary Figure 8 )  In summary  we conduct nanoscopic- and microscopic-level morphology characterization to reveal the real morphology of the hot-cast layered perovskite solar cells  Based on that  we propose a model to explain their working mechanism : the photons absorbed by the layered perovskite phases can contribute to the photocurrent by energy transfer process from the larger bandgap layered phases to the smaller bandgap 3D-like phase  and the carrier transport within the perovskite layer is mainly through the 3D-like phase which forms a percolating network across the vertical direction of the solar cell devices  Methods Preparation of perovskite solar cells The ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned sequentially in acetone and isopropyl alcohol under sonication for 30 min  twice for each step  After drying in a vacuum oven  the substrates were treated by ultraviolet ( UV ) ozone for 15 min and then transferred to nitrogen glovebox for use  The precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving specific stoichiometric quantities of BAI  MAI and PbI2 in DMF ( molar ratio 2:3:4 for n = 4 ) with a concentration of 10 M PTAA layers as the hole transport layer were firstly deposited on ITO substrates by spin-coating PTAA solution ( 02 wt % in Toluene ) at 6000 rpm for 35 s  followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min  Then  the pre-heated PTAA-coated substrate was immediately transferred to the vacuum chunk of spin coater within 5 s  followed by dropping the hot perovskite precursor solution ( 60 μL  70 °C ) on hot substrate and spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 20 s without ramp  The hot-cast films were then annealed at 85 °C for 3 s PCBM as the electron transport layers were directly deposited on top of perovskite layers by spin-coating the solution ( 20 mg mL−1 in 12-dichlorobenzene ( DCB ) ) at 6000 rpm for 35 s and afterwards annealed at 100 °C for 30 min  C60 ( buffer layers ) and BCP ( hole blocking layers ) were thermally evaporated sequentially  which is followed by the thermal evaporation of Cu electrode  Film characterization The XRD experiments were performed by a Bruker D8 Discover Diffractometer utilizing Cu Kα radiation  The SEM images were obtained with a Quanta 200 FEG ESEM scanning electron microscope  The absorption spectra were recorded by an Evolution 201/220 UV/vis ( visible ) Spectrophotometer  Photoluminescence measurements were performed with a Horiba 320 detector  and all the PL measurements were conducted in reflection mode  The transmission mapping of layered ( BA ) 2MA3Pb4I13 thin films was taken by an optical microscope Olympus BX61 combined with a 650-nm long pass filter  Photovoltaic device characterization The photocurrent density-voltage curves of the photovoltaic devices were recorded by a Keithley 2400 Source-Meter with homemade testing software  The devices were exposed to a xenon-lamp based solar simulator ( Oriel 67005  150 W ) under AM 15 G irradiation ( 100 mW cm−2 )  the light intensity was calibrated by a Si photodiode ( Hamamatsu S1133 )  The J-V tests were swept along forward direction with scan rate of 01 V s−1 and delay time of 100 ms  The EQE measurement was conducted using a Newport QE measurement kit  and the intensity of monochromatic beam of light was calibrated with a reference silicon photodiode and focused onto the working areas of devices  Synthesis of the layered perovskite single crystals For layered perovskite single crystal with n = 3 synthesis  the liquid phase crystallization method was used as reported previously113435  The 1844 g lead ( II ) iodide  198 μL n-butylamine and 0477 g methylammonium iodide were completely dissolved in 6 mL hydriodic acid at 110 °C  Subsequently  the hot solution was slowly cooled down to room temperature  typically decreasing 10 °C for 1 h Layered perovskite single crystal plate will gradually precipitate and grow at the solution–air interface  Characterization of the layered single crystal The successful synthesis of layered perovskite single crystal with n = 3 was confirmed by the UV/vis absorption and XRD measurement  The Absorption spectra were recorded using an Evolution 201 UV/Visible Spectrophotometer  The X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained by a Rigaku D/Max-B X-ray diffractometer in the Bragg–Brentano parafocusing geometry  A conventional copper target X-ray tube equipped in the diffracted-beam monochromator was set to 45 kV and 40 mA  Grazing-incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering experiment The GIWAXS patterns were measured at an incident angle of 1o at beamline 733 at the Advanced Light Source in Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with a 10 keV X-ray energy on a Pilatus 2 M detector36  The patterns were corrected and produced using Igor Pro and a modified version of the NIKA package37  The color scale of the patterns is logarithmic  The molecular schematics in Supplementary Figure 3b and Supplementary Figure 3d were created using CrystalMaker® version 1022  The layered perovskite ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) 3Pb4I13 thin films for 2D GIWAXS measurement were fabricated with the same method as those in the high PCE layered perovskite solar cells  except that silicon ( 100 ) substrates were used while with PTAA layer on it  Transmission electron microscope characterization The HRTEM samples were prepared by extracting the cross-section of the thin film fabricated by hot-casting  Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) lift-out samples were prepared via focused ion beam ( FIB ) polishing in a Helios NanoLab™ 660 SEM  The sample was extracted by FIB with accelerating voltage of 5 kV and current of 12 nA  After the lamella was prepared  it was welded to a TEM copper grid by platinum  After that  it was gradually thinned to electron transparency with an ion beam of accelerating voltage of 5 kV and gradually reducing current of 41 pA  15 pA and 7 pA  The SEM accelerating voltage was kept at 5 kV for the entire process  Once the sample preparation was complete  the lift-out sample was transferred to the TEM chamber immediately in less than 1 min of exposure to air  The TEM was carried out by FEI Tecnai OsirisTM with 200 kV and 80 kV beam voltage  To investigate if the samples are free from FIB damages  we doctor bladed the ( BA ) 2MA3Pb4I13 precursor solution directly on copper grid  In Supplementary Figure 9  it can be seen that without FIB process the same wide lattice structure also showed up  Thus  the FIB process-induced damage can be excluded  Besides  damages from the transmitted electron beam were also investigated ( in Supplementary Figure 10 )  We found that the sample transits from crystalline to amorphous phase when it is exposed to electron beam longer than 5 s38  Thus  all TEM images were taken within 5 s Transient absorption spectroscopy Transient absorption experiments are conducted with a 45 fs  4 mJ Coherent Libra with a 1 kHz repetition rate  The 570 nm pump beam is from a visible continuum generated by focusing 15 mJ of the 800 nm fundamental into a 4 m long tube  An all-reflective 4 F setup is utilized to filter the desired portion of the spectrum  The spectrally filtered pump pulses have 5 nm widths and 250 fs durations  Continuum probe pulses are generated in a sapphire window and relayed to the sample with reflective optics  Signal detection is accomplished with a CMOS ( complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor ) array detector that is synchronized to the 1 kHz repetition rate of the laser system  TPC measurement During this measurement  a nanosecond pulsed N2 laser was used to generate charge carriers close to the anode of the device that were driven toward the cathode by the built-in electric field  and the photocurrent was recorded by a GHz oscilloscope with an input resistor of 50 Ω  For the as-fabricated device with working area of about 8 mm2  the measured response time of the device was comparable to its RC time constant  ie  175 ns ( Fig  7c )  This indicates that the intrinsic charge transit time across the device is smaller than the RC time constant  which is consistent with our previous reports  To eliminate the influence of RC time constant on the TPC signal  we gradually decreased the working area of the same device so that the device capacitance was reduced  It is found that the discrepancy between the device RC time constant and the TPC decay time is becoming larger when decreasing the device area  implying the charge transit time gradually dominates the TPC signal  Based on the response time of the smallest area device ( τ )  we can derive the carrier mobility in the vertical direction with the following expression : mu = frac { { d^2 } } { { V_ { mathrm { b } } tau } }  ( 2 ) where d is the film thickness and Vb is the built-in potential  Data availability The data that support the plots within this paper are available from the corresponding author upon requestThe efficiencies of perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) are now reaching such consistently high levels that scalable manufacturing at low cost is becoming critical  However  this remains challenging due to the expensive hole-transporting materials usually employed  and difficulties associated with the scalable deposition of other functional layers  By simplifying the device architecture  hole-transport-layer-free PSCs with improved photovoltaic performance are fabricated via a scalable doctor-blading process  Molecular doping of halide perovskite films improved the conductivity of the films and their electronic contact with the conductive substrate  resulting in a reduced series resistance  It facilitates the extraction of photoexcited holes from perovskite directly to the conductive substrate  The bladed hole-transport-layer-free PSCs showed a stabilized power conversion efficiency above 200 %  This work represents a significant step towards the scalable  cost-effective manufacturing of PSCs with both high performance and simple fabrication processes  Similar content being viewed by others Advances in the Application of Perovskite Materials Article

2020–2021 Article Open access 07 July 2021 Introduction Since their first report in 2009  halide perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted enormous interest as emerging light-to-electricity conversion optoelectronic devices with both high efficiency and ease of solution processability123  To date  the power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of solution-processed PSCs have been certified at well above 20 % 456  However  all top-performing PSCs were fabricated by a spin-coating method which is unsuitable for high throughput and scalable module production  Several scalable film deposition techniques have been developed for PSC fabrication  such as doctor-blading78910  spray deposition11  slot-die coating12  solution printing13  and electrodeposition14  In particular  doctor-blade coating with a controlled substrate temperature has gained most success in depositing high-quality perovskite films with large grains and controllable optoelectronic properties15  Moreover  blade coating has great potential to be scaled up for roll-to-roll fabrication  Encouragingly  the PCEs of PSCs with bladed perovskite layers have steadily increased to above 19 %  approaching the levels of their spin-coated counterparts1316  A next step towards the scalable fabrication of PSCs is to coat the charge transport layers by scalable processes  However  the existing multiple-layer device structures  either p–i–n or n–i–p structures with a hole transport layer ( HTL )  perovskite  and electron transport layer ( ETL )  impose a great challenge on the scalable fabrication of PSCs in a cost-effective manner17181920  First  high-performance organic hole-transporting materials  such as 22′77′-Tetrakis [ N  N-di ( 4-methoxyphenyl ) amino ] -99′-spirobifluorene ( spiro-OMeTAD )  are much more expensive than perovskite materials  Second  for the devices with p–i–n structure  it is difficult to blade-coat perovskite films onto a hydrophobic HTL  eg  poly ( bis ( 4-phenyl ) ( 246-trimethylphenyl ) amine ) ( PTAA )  while a hydrophilic HTL  eg  NiO x  is difficult to form on plastic substrates at low temperature  nor can easily be coated at optimal thickness and electronic quality to achieve the highest device efficiency  Hence  we believe that the elimination of the HTL from the PSC device architecture can be an effective way to solve this challenge  By reducing one step of the standard coating process  at least one third of the manufacture cost and time can be saved  in addition to savings of material cost for the HTL  The reported ambipolar charge transport characteristics of halide perovskite materials endow them with great potential to construct PSCs with simplified device architecture  such as HTL-free PSCs with either conventional or inverted structure212223  Yet  a critical challenge for HTL-free PSCs is the ineffective hole collection by indium tin oxide ( ITO ) because of mismatched work functions between ITO and the perovskite  which generally causes significant efficiency loss232425  In addition  the construction of HTL-free devices by the blade-coating method faces more challenges due to rougher and more non-uniform perovskite films  than do those prepared by spin-coating with the anti-solvent method  Here we report a molecular-doping strategy for a perovskite layer to doctor-blade HTL-free PSCs with a simplified device structure of ITO/perovskite/ETL/Cu  Doping methylammonium lead iodide ( MAPbI3 ) films with 2356-tetrafluoro-7788-tetracyanoquinodimethane ( F4TCNQ )  a strong electron-withdrawing molecule  leads to a modified ITO/MAPbI3 interface with favorable band bending  which facilitates the extraction of photoexcited holes from perovskite to ITO electrode  Combining additive engineering and solvent annealing  high-quality MAPbI3 films are obtained with full surface coverage  micrometer-sized grains  and improved crystallinity  By employing a bladed and doped MAPbI3 film as the photoactive layer in a HTL-free device structure  a stabilized PCE over 200 % with almost no J–V hysteresis is obtained  Results Perovskite films fabrication and molecular doping The MAPbI3 perovskite films were directly deposited onto blank ITO glass substrates by a previously reported doctor-blading method9  which is schematically illustrated in Fig  1a  Before blade coating  the ITO substrates were cleaned by a UV-ozone treatment to improve their wettability to perovskite solution23  MAPbI3 precursor dissolved in N  N-diethylformamide ( DMF ) containing p-type dopant ( F4TCNQ ) was dripped onto substrates which were heated at 150 °C  followed by a quick blading process to spread the solution onto the substrates  After blading  the perovskite precursor solution dried in a few seconds  and the substrates were quickly removed from the hot plate and annealed at 100 °C for varied durations  The bladed perovskite films showed thicknesses of 500 ± 20 nm from cross-sectional imaging ( Fig  1b ) by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM )  To implement molecular doping of the perovskite layer  F4TCNQ with chemical structure shown in Fig  1a was dissolved in DMF separately  and then added to the as-prepared MAPbI3 precursor solution  Perovskite films made without or with F4TCNQ were denoted as MAPbI3 or MAPbI3 : F4TCNQ  respectively  Fig  1 figure 1 Doctor blading and doping of perovskite films by F4TCNQ  a Schematic illustration of a doctor-bladed perovskite film and the chemical structure of F4TCNQ dopant  b Cross-sectional SEM image of the MAPbI3 film deposited directly onto ITO

diagram and electron transfer process for MAPbI3 : F4TCNQ blends Full size image The doping of perovskite is expected to change the work function of the films  Kelvin probe force microscopy ( KPFM ) was used to determine the surface potential change of perovskite films upon F4TCNQ mixing  In addition to direct mixing of F4TCNQ and MAPbI3 in precursor solution  MAPbI3 : F4TCNQ was prepared by solid diffusion via heating F4TCNQ powder on MAPbI3 and then removing the excess F4TCNQ  The topography and contact potential difference ( CPD ) images of pristine MAPbI3 and MAPbI3 : F4TCNQ films by either standard solution mixing or solid diffusion are shown in Fig  1c–h  For better comparison  the three CPD images are flattened and presented in the same color scale  while the histograms of the absolute CPD values of the three types of films are plotted in Fig  1i  The pure MAPbI3 film has coarse grains and uniform CPD distribution ( Fig  1c  f )  In contrast  solution mixed MAPbI3 : F4TCNQ film  in which uniform doping is expected  has fine grains and greater heterogeneity of the CPD distribution ( Fig  1d  g )  For the sample with solid-diffused F4TCNQ  some small F4TCNQ particles were placed on top of a MAPbI3 film  and the CPD imaging was conducted around the edge ( the green color line as indicated in Fig  1h ) to include both neat and doped perovskite regions  Such method leads to a clear edge between diffused and undiffused regions that can be visualized in the CPD image ( Fig  1h )  thus the CPD heterogeneity is even higher  The change of absolute CPD caused by F4TCNQ doping is clearly demonstrated in Fig  1i  A decrease of surface potential or in other words an increase of work function was observed for the MAPbI3 : F4TCNQ films  irrespective of direct mixing or solid diffusion  The increase of heterogeneity for the MAPbI3 : F4TCNQ films is also reflected in the broadening of the curves  This confirmed p-type doping of MAPbI3 by F4TCNQ  Specifically  after the addition of electron-withdrawing F4TCNQ molecule to the MAPbI3  owing to the deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) level of F4TCNQ  electrons in the valance band of MAPbI3 can be thermally activated into the LUMO level of F4TCNQ  which leaves holes in MAPbI3 and thus causes its p-doping ( Fig  1j )  As a result  the hole concentration in the MAPbI3 film increased  The carrier concentration change upon F4TCNQ doping has been evaluated by analyzing the dark capacitance vs voltage ( C–V ) characteristics of the perovskite devices ( Supplementary Fig  1 )  Charge density profiles were extracted from the C–V curves using Mott–Schottky analysis2627  The carrier concentration in the perovskite layer was calculated to be 06 × 1016 cm−3 in the neat MAPbI3 film which increased to 24 × 1016 cm−3 after the addition of 003 wt % F4TCNQ  This molecular p-type doping strategy enabled the fabrication of an HTL-free PSC with a simplified device configuration but still effective p–n heterojunction ( ie  p-doped perovskite and n-type ETL )  and thus enhanced device performance  Electronic properties of doped perovskite films The electronic properties of the MAPbI3 : F4TCNQ films were investigated by comparing their current density–voltage ( J–V ) characteristics with pristine MAPbI3 films deposited on glass substrates in the dark condition  The lateral conductivity was measured across gold electrodes spaced 100 µm apart ( Fig  2a )  As shown in Fig  2b  the MAPbI3 : F4TCNQ film exhibited a nearly tenfold increase in conductivity over the neat MAPbI3 film  which confirmed that F4TCNQ doped MAPbI3  The charge transfer from MAPbI3 to F4TCNQ is expected to cause quenching of photoluminescence ( PL ) from the MAPbI3 layer  which was measured by using time-resolved photoluminescence ( TRPL ) decay for MAPbI3 films deposited on glass substrates ( Fig  2c )  The MAPbI3 : F4TCNQ prepared on glass substrate showed a PL lifetime of 65 ns  which is fourfold shorter than the PL lifetime of pristine MAPbI3 film ( 268 ns ) on glass  Fig  2 figure 2 Conductivities and photoluminescence lifetimes of neat or doped perovskite films  a Geometry for the lateral conductivity measurement : the perovskite films were 500 nm thick  with 1 mm gold ( Au ) electrodes separated by 100 μm  b J–V curves of neat or F4TCNQ-doped MAPbI3 deposited on normal glass

c-AFM setup  Topographic AFM images of e MAPbI3 and g MAPbI3 : F4TCNQ films  with locations where the c-AFM tip measured the grain and GB currents  Local dark currents measured at the GBs and on the grains for the f MAPbI3 film and h MAPbI3 : F4TCNQ film Full size image The relative large molecular size of F4TCNQ likely prevents its integration into the lattice of MAPbI3  Therefore  we speculate that F4TCNQ molecules most probably remain at the grain boundary ( GB ) regions of perovskite films and/or perovskite/electrode interfaces  To determine the lateral distribution of F4TCNQ molecules  the local dark conductivity at grains and GBs was measured using conducting atomic force microscopy ( c-AFM )  Figure 2d illustrates the c-AFM setup  where the microscope tip was positioned at locations randomly chosen from topographic AFM images ( Fig  2e  g )  The tip bias was scanned in the range +20 to −20 V at a rate of 014 V s−1  For the neat MAPbI3 film  the dark currents were similar at the grain and GB regions ( Fig  2f and Supplementary Fig  2a  b )  which is in accordance with previous reporting28  In sharp contrast  the dark currents measured at the GB regions of the MAPbI3 : F4TCNQ film were notably higher ( Fig  2h and Supplementary Figs  2c  d )  elucidating the remarkably improved conductivity at the GB region after molecular doping of MAPbI3 by F4TCNQ  At the regions close to GBs  the F4TCNQ molecules and MAPbI3 undergo charge transfer  leading to an increase in carrier density in MAPbI3 and thus the enhanced dark conductivity29  Morphologies and crystallinities of perovskite films High-quality perovskite films with large grains  high crystallinity and complete surface coverage are also crucial to achieving high-performance HTL-free devices  The blending of F4TCNQ in the perovskite in a small percentage ( ranged from 001 to 005 wt % ) did not notably change the morphology and grain size of the perovskite films  as shown by the SEM images in Supplementary Fig  3  nor cause a drastic change of crystallinity  as shown by the XRD patterns of bladed MAPbI3 films prepared with different amounts of F4TCNQ in Supplementary Fig  4  Accordingly  methylammonium hypophosphite ( MHP ) and methylammonium chloride ( MACl ) were introduced as additives to the precursor solution  and co-solvents ( dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) / chlorobenzene ( CBZ ) ) post-annealing process was also combined to achieve a high-quality and high-crystalline MAPbI3 film ( Supplementary Figs  5  6 and 7 for SEM images and XRD patterns of bladed MAPbI3 films prepared with different amounts of MHP as well as using co-solvents annealing technique in the absence or presence of MACl ) 910163031  Figure 3a  b show representative SEM images of the bladed perovskite films after optimization  which featured a uniform morphology that extended hundreds of micrometers  The perovskite domains were densely packed together  and without observable voids at domain boundaries ( Fig  3a )  It should be noted that these domains are not single crystalline grains  Each micrometer-scale convection domain was comprised of micro-sized grains ranging from 800 to 1700 nm

concentrations have been displayed in the Supplementary Table 1  which indicated the optimal F4TCNQ concentration was 003 wt %  Figure 3d shows the current density vs voltage ( J–V ) characteristics of PSCs based on the pristine MAPbI3 films and MAPbI3 : F4TCNQ films ( with 003 wt % F4TCNQ )  with photovoltaic parameters summarized in Table 1  The reference PSC without F4TCNQ ( ie  MAPbI3 ) exhibited a poor PCE of just 110 %  which is in accordance with that of most reported HTL-free PSCs2324  Surprisingly  with the addition of F4TCNQ  notable concurrent enhancements of the Jsc  Voc  and FF have been achieved  The champion cell based on MAPbI3 : F4TCNQ film achieved the highest PCE of 202 %  with a Jsc of 227 mA cm−2  a Voc of 110 V  and a FF of 081  To the best of our knowledge  this is the record efficiency for the bladed PSCs in the absence of HTLs  For comparison  the PSC based on the PTAA HTL and undoped MAPbI3 layer has been fabricated  which showcases a PCE of 195 %  along with a Jsc of 221 mA cm−2  a Voc of 112 V  and a FF of 079  This result is in good agreement with our previous reports8916  It is worth noting that the demonstrated HTL-free device showed similar or even better photovoltaic performance  highlighting the effectiveness of such a doping strategy for constructing high-performance PSCs with not only a simpler structure  but also less deposition steps and lower material cost  The J–V curves of MAPbI3 : F4TCNQ-based device were measured in both reverse and forward scan modes at a scan rate of 01 V s−1  and almost no hysteresis was observed ( Supplementary Fig  8 )  Figure 3e shows the stabilized photocurrent density of this device as measured at 093 V  giving a stabilized PCE exceeding 200 % under continuous light soaking  This high stabilized PCE output is among the best record for HTL-free PSCs  and is quite remarkable given that the device is prepared using a scalable fabrication method  Figure 3f shows the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of the champion device  The integrated Jsc from the EQE measurement agreed well with the Jsc values measured under AM 15 G one sun illumination ( Fig  3d )  The fabrication procedure was repeated to confirm the reliability and reproducibility of the results  The PCE histogram was collected from 30 independent cells ( Fig  3g )  revealing that more than 73 % of the cells had PCEs above 180 %  and more than 93 % had PCEs higher than 170 % under one sun illumination  A study of the stability for the devices with or without HTL has been conducted  The devices were stored under ambient conditions ( where humidity and temperature were about 20 % and 25 °C  respectively ) without any encapsulation  As compared to the devices with HTL  the HTL-free device exhibits a slightly better stability  which maintained over 92 % of its initial PCE after storage for 500 h ( Supplementary Fig  9 )  Table 1 Photovoltaic parameters of PSCs employing neat or doped perovskite layers under one sun light illumination ( AM 15 G  100 mW cm−2 ) Full size table It is noted from Fig  3d and Table 1 that the almost twofold efficiency enhancement in the F4TCNQ-doped devices primarily originates from the remarkable FF increase  Further analysis of the J–V curves in Fig  3d revealed that F4TCNQ doping of the perovskite layer significantly reduced device series resistance ( Rs ) from 256 Ω cm2 for undoped device to 26 Ω cm2 for doped device  The influence of Rs on device FF has been well established in diode based solar cells32  according to the classical equation based on diode equation : I = I_ { mathrm { L } } - I_ { mathrm { 0 } } { mathrm { exp } } left [ { frac { { q ( V + IR_ { mathrm { s } } ) } } { { nkT } } } right ] ( 1 ) where I is the device output current  IL is the maximum light generated current  I0 is saturated dark current  Rs is series resistance  n is ideal factor  k is Boltzmann constant  T is temperature  Assuming a diode ideal factor of 1  the FFs for the undoped and doped devices were calculated to be 53 % and 83 % from Eq  ( 1 )  which are very close to measured values of 56 % and 81 %  respectively  This indicates the increased FF for the devices with doped MAPbI3 is mainly caused by the reduction of the series resistance  To find out the origin of reduced series resistance by F4TCNQ doping  energy level diagrams are constructed and shown in Fig  4 for the perovskite/ITO interface with or without F4TCNQ doping  Here the energy levels were extracted from the literature for the films made with same composition and similar method3334  For undoped MAPbI3  the Fermi level of pristine MAPbI3 ( nearly intrinsic ) is slightly lower than that of ITO ( −47 eV ) 34  The Fermi level lines up during contact formation and causes a downward band-bending in MAPbI3  which forms a barrier for hole extraction from MAPbI3 to ITO ( Fig  4a )  This would also increase the possibility of charge recombination and increase series resistance at the ITO/perovskite interface  In contrast  the incorporation of F4TCNQ in the MAPbI3 films turns the MAPbI3 to more p-type  particularly at the interface of ITO and MAPbI3  which should avert band-bending direction ( Fig  4b )  This was confirmed by surface potential measurement that the F4TCNQ doping can increase work function of perovskite by ~01 to 02 eV ( Fig  1i )  As is shown in Fig  4b  the F4TCNQ doping results in an upward band bending at the ITO/MAPbI3 : F4TCNQ interface  In this case  the hole transfer from F4TCNQ-doped MAPbI3 to ITO is thus facilitated  resulting in a reduced series resistance to increase FF35  Fig  4 figure 4 Interfacial hole transfer dynamics  Schematic illustrations of hole transfer at the a ITO/MAPbI3 or b ITO/F4TCNQ-doped MAPbI3 interface Full size image The diode Eq  ( 1 ) predicts that Rs variation has no influence on device Voc  while in our case  the F4TCNQ doping increased device Voc from 100 to 110 V This discrepancy indicates there is another factor  in addition to Rs  which leads to the Voc enhancement  To find out the reason  a transient photovoltage spectroscopy ( TPV ) measurement was also carried out to understand the charge carrier recombination dynamics  As shown in Supplementary Fig  10  the MAPbI3 : F4TCNQ-based PSC had a longer carrier lifetime ( 069 μs ) than the reference device based on neat MAPbI3 ( 030 μs ) under one sun illumination  This result was consistent with the larger Voc for the device with doping  The observed carrier recombination lifetime enhancement could be a result of band-bending configuration change due to doping  though there may be other reasons that may also change the carrier recombination lifetime  For instance  for the device with undoped MAPbI3  the retarded hole extraction would increase the possibility of charge recombination  because they can not be effectively extracted out  Discussion We demonstrated how molecular doping influences the series resistance and interfacial charge transfer within HTL-free PSC devices with or without F4TCNQ incorporated in the perovskite layer  In the absence of HTL  both the electrons and holes can transport to the ITO/perovskite interface and recombine there  leading to serious interfacial charge recombination and thus inferior charge collection36  In addition  the mismatched work functions between perovskite and ITO would induce an undesirable energy barrier that leads to inferior hole transfer  These situations are all very detrimental to device performance  Molecular doping of perovskite by F4TCNQ to some extent induces favorable interfacial band bending  which allows efficient transport of holes at ITO/perovskite interface ( Fig  4b ) 35  Choosing an appropriate p-type dopant with proper molecular size and selected surface hydrophility with ITO substrate is promising to further improve the ITO/perovskite interfacial affinity  Owing to the larger molecular size of F4TCNQ than the interstitial sites in perovskite structure  the F4TCNQ concentrated at the grain boundary regions  The dopant assisted with charge dissociation and thus resulting in more balanced transfer of electrons and holes to their respective electrodes  which decreased the possibility of the charge carrier recombination  We found the charge trap density within MAPbI3 : F4TCNQ-based PSC was even slightly smaller than its pristine MAPbI3 counterpart ( Supplementary Fig  11 )  It has been demonstrated that the trap sites within the organic semiconductors can be reduced due to partial filling by doping  typically at very low doping levels37  In summary  an additive-assisted strategy for p-type molecular doping of solution-bladed perovskite films was demonstrated  F4TCNQ-doped MAPbI3 films show increased electrical conductivity  especially at grain boundary regions  and increased charge carrier concentrations  The incorporation of F4TCNQ in perovskite layers could modify the ITO/perovskite interface with reduced series resistance  which could be attributed to the favorable interfacial band bending for facilitated hole transfer and extraction from perovskite to ITO  The simple but effective approach enabled the scalable fabrication of HTL-free PSC devices with a simplified device geometry  Molecular doping of perovskite film by F4TCNQ led to the considerable enhancement of photovoltaic performance from 110 to 202 %  The MAPbI3 : F4TCNQ-based device exhibited a stabilized PCE that exceeded 200 % and negligible hysteresis  This effective doping strategy eliminates the HTL preparation step  thus simplifying the PSC fabrication process and reducing costs  Extending the application of this doping technique to a broader range of semiconducting materials will definitely benefit the construction of other high performance  printed optoelectronic devices  Methods Materials preparation Lead iodide ( PbI2  999985 % ) was purchased from Alfa Aesar

Introduction The dielectric properties of BaTiO3 are controlled by purity and microstructure which are dependent on the methods of preparation [ 1 ]  Controlling the phase  composition homogeneity  particle size and monodispersity are other concerns in developing techniques for synthesizing barium titanate  The electrical properties of ceramic materials are a direct result of their microstructure [ 2 ]  while it is well known that there is a connection between microstructure and type of porosity  grain size distribution and second-phase content [ 3 ]  Generally  the properties of BaTiO3 depend on the synthesis method and sintering regime  The traditional solid-state method used in our research for BaTiO3 synthesis has strict criteria with regard to particle size and purity of the raw material  while it is also easy to produce non-homogeneous powders [ 4 ]  The advantages of the solid-state reaction used in mass production are its simplicity  precise stoichiometric control and low cost  with the main disadvantage being that the high calcining temperature results in very large and non-uniform grain sizes [ 5 ]  As a consequence  this method does not allow the production of materials with a high dielectric constant [ 5 ]  In order to eliminate the disadvantages of the solid-state reaction  a variety of novel wet chemical synthesis methods have been developed [ 6 ]  In this study  we analyse the manufacture of BaTiO3 material destined for use in stacked-disk multilayer actuator production  SEM microstructures and electric properties of the fabricated pellets are also presented and discussed  The problem of metal layer deposition on barium titanate ceramics during actuator fabrication is considered  2 Results and Discussion The BaTiO3 pellets were obtained in a mould of external diameter 115 mm  with home-made BaTiO3 granulate of weight 06 g and uniaxial pressing under a pressure of 1 MPa  The beams were uniaxially pressed under a pressure of 5 MPa in a full mould filled for beam execution with barium titanate granulate  The green discs and beams obtained in this manner were then isostatically pressed under a pressure of 150 MPa  The dilatometric curve was executed using the high temperature dilatometer from BÄHR-Gerätebau GmbH company in order to determine at which temperature barium titanate pellets and beams should be sintered to receive full dense sinters  On the basis of the obtained dilatometric curve ( Fig  1a )  the maximal sintering temperatures were estimated as 1250 °C  Pellets and beams were sintered in the electric furnace with the rate of both heating and cooling equal to 100 °C/h and the dwell time—4 h Sintered pellets and beams are hereafter denoted as BT_0  Fig  1 figure 1 The dilatometric curve of beam before sintering ( a ) and AC conductivity versus frequency ( b ) Full size image The electrical properties of BT_0 pellets were determined  with pellet AC conductivity measured as a function of frequency at 150 °C as shown in Fig  1b  It is well known that at room temperature  conductivity is almost independent of temperature and instead depends strongly on frequency  Analysis of AC conductivity versus frequency plot ( Fig  1b ) reveals that BT_0 conductivity increases with increasing frequency  However  there is a little signature of a plateau in the curve at higher frequencies  beyond the measuring range  It is therefore evident that the linear ( dispersion ) region represents some sort of relaxation process  The dependence of AC conductivity on frequency may be influenced by carrier transport excited to localised states near the band edge  as well as hopping of the charge carriers through trap sites separated by energy barriers of various heights  In other words  AC conductivity contributes in the form of the hopping of localised and free charge carriers [ 7 ]  Particularly  at low temperature  AC conductivity can occur through the carrier motion over a shorter distance between sites in the potential well  In the present study  the AC conductivity for BT_0 was found to be of the order of 10−9  which is close related with literature  It is considered that the AC conductivity is contributed by hopping of localized and free charges  At room temperature  the dielectric constant value for BT_0 pellets was found to decrease with frequency ( Fig  2a )  BT_0 thus exhibits normal dielectric dispersion because the dielectric constant ( ε′ and ε′′ ) decreases with increasing frequency  The phenomenon of dielectric dispersion is attributed to Maxwell–Wagner type interfacial polarisation in accordance with Koop ’ s phenomenological theory [ 8 ]  This theory states that the conductivity of grain boundaries contributes more to dielectric permittivity at lower frequencies and temperatures  The sintering of polycrystalline perovskite involves the formation of grains with high conductivity  These grains are separated by poorly conducting grain boundaries  as can been seen in SEM images  and exhibit low conduction ; BT_0 perovskite thus behaves as a heterogeneous dielectric material  Fig  2 figure 2 Dielectric constant versus frequency ( a ) and dielectric loss versus frequency ( b ) Full size image In addition Ti4+ is reduced to Ti3+ and formed a conduction electron ( Ti4+•e ) in order to keep charge neutrality  It can be found that dielectric permittivity measured at lower frequency is always greater than higher frequency  With the increasing frequency  dielectric constant decreases very fast up to 105 Hz and in frequency range from 106 to 107 Hz it is almost constant  The higher value of dielectric constant of 1700 may possibly also strongly depend on the density of the sample due to the sintering process of BaTiO3  The dielectric loss represents a combined result of electrical conduction and orientational polarization of the matter  Figure 2b shows the variation of dielectric loss tangent δ ( tanδ ) with frequency for BT_0  The investigated material shows a normal dielectric behaviour  Dielectric loss tangent decreases with increasing frequency of the alternating field  and the maximum value of 05 was obtained at low frequencies  The permittivity loss curve at 30 °C shows two relaxation peaks which occurs when the frequency jumping of electrons Ti4+ ↔ Ti3+ is equal to the frequency of the applied AC field [ 9 ]  Moreover  the values of tanδ decrease at higher frequency in the range 0007–0001  Therefore  the energy losses were due to conductivity and dipole relaxation  The loss factor tan δ of a dielectric material is a useful indicator of the energy loss as heat  The first stage of actuator fabrication is frequently characterised by the problem of metal layer deposition on barium titanate ceramics  In order to ensure the most suitable adhesion of layers  pellets were polished using abrasive paper 320  which also enabled the production of the expected pellet thickness of 071 mm and diameter of 966 mm  Two commercial products ( Technicqll  Chester Molecular Metal Super ) developed for metallic layer deposition were applied  Technicqll is a silver-based product  which allows the creation of adhesive layers that conduct an electric current  and is characterised by a low resistance equal to 001 Ω  The second product—Chester Metal Super—is a two-element tixotropic epoxy-metallic composite  Both commercial products were utilised during trials of metallic layer deposition on BT_0 pellets  The treated samples are hereafter denoted as BT_0_S for Technicqll and BT_0_M for Chester Molecular Metal Super treatments  Analysis of the top-most metallic layers deposited on the barium titanate pellets revealed their high quality at the macroscopic scale  However  in order to verify whether the bonding layers adhered well to the ceramic pellets  SEM images of fracture surfaces for BT_0_S ( Fig  3a  b ) and BT_0_M ( Fig  3c  d ) were obtained  Fig  3 figure 3 SEM images of ( a  b ) BT_0_S and ( c  d ) BT_0_M fracture surfaces at two different magnifications : ( a  c ) ×50 and ( b  d ) ×200 Full size image Considered fracture surfaces of BT_0_S and BT_0_M samples with indicated three areas under observation are presented in Fig  4  In both samples  areas number 1 and 3 are placed on barium titanate ceramic and area number 2 is situated on bonding layers  Fig  4 figure 4 SEM microstructure of fracture surface of BT_0_S ( a ) and BT_0_M ( b ) samples with identified three considered areas Full size image Results of weight % of chemical elements presented in these three indicated areas for BT_0_S and BT_0_M samples  were determined  As one can expected  on areas number 1 and 3  Ba and Ti elements are presented and the weight percent of these elements is very similar in all area  569 % ± 04 and 235 % ± 01 respectively for Ba and Ti  In the case of BT_0_S sample  the metallic layer is mainly composed from silver ( 664 % )  which is also according to expectation  A small amount of Si ( 33 % ) in bonded layer comes probably from the applied product composition  The chemical composition of Chester Molecular Metal Super was not presented on the product datasheet but from obtained results follow that this product is composed from Fe ( 107 % )  Cr ( 254 % )  Ti ( 128 % ) and Si ( 223 % )  It should be underlined that at both metallic layers Ti element is present but it is not sure whether its appearance is connected with local migration from ceramic layers to bonding one  The first short actuator presented in Fig  5  was made from a piece of BT_0 beams with cutting three gaps by saw  Finally  these gaps are filled in using Technicqll product to obtain metal layers  Fig  5 figure 5 Photo of the actuator manufactured from barium titanate ceramic and three metallic layers Full size image 3 Conclusions The investigated material shows a normal dielectric behaviour  Dielectric loss tangent decreases with increasing frequency of the alternating field  and the maximum value of 05 was obtained at low frequencies  What is interesting  the sintering temperature did not increase considerably the size of grains  The obtained in this approach the sinter microstructure  is very similar to this presented in literature by other authors  In order to receive better result of the barium titanate dielectric constant  the microstructure of sinter must be improved in the direction of the smaller grains getting  The SEM images of both BT_0_S and BT_0_M samples reveal high quality ceramic-metallic-ceramic bonding  with very good adhesion properties and without any fractures  In the case of BT_0_S  additional intermediate layers between the barium titanate and metallic material were created  These thin layers should ensure better adhesion of appropriate materials  Therefore  Technicqll was selected for use in further investigations  Referencesor organic-inorganic perovskite to be considered as the most promising materials for light emitting diodes and solar cell applications  the active materials must be proven to be stable under various conditions  such as ambient environment  heat and electrical bias  Understanding the degradation process in organic-inorganic perovskite light emitting diodes ( PeLEDs ) is important to improve the stability and the performance of the device  We revealed that electrical bias can greatly influence the luminance and external quantum efficiency of PeLEDs  It was found that device performance could be improved under low voltage bias with short operation time  and decreased with continuous operation  The degradation of perovskite film under high electrical bias leads to the decrease of device performance  Variations in the absorption  morphology and element distribution of perovskite films under different electrical bias revealed that organic-inorganic perovskites are unstable at high electrical bias  We bring new insights in the PeLEDs which are crucial for improving the stability  Similar content being viewed by others Role of electrodes on perovskite solar cells performance : A review Article 17 January 2022 Recent progress in electron transport bilayer for

halide perovskite materials  methylammonium lead halide ( MAPbX3  X = Cl  Br  I ) and formamidinium lead halide ( FAPbX3  X = Cl  Br  I )  have attracted much attention for photovoltaic recently  due to high absorption coefficients  long charge carrier diffusion lengths and solution processability12345  In less than five years  the power conversion efficiency of organic-inorganic perovskite ( OIP ) solar cell increased from 38 % to 22 % 6  Being excellent light conversion materials  perovskites are also being considered as good light emitting materials  which have tunable band gaps  high color purity  benefit from facile solution processing  and low material cost78910  Researchers made great efforts to improve the photoluminescence quantum yield and the device performance by compositional engineering  processing techniques  and interfacial engineering  The perovskite LEDs ( PeLEDs ) based on solution-processed method were first demonstrated by Tan et al  in 2014  which achieved a luminance of 364 cd m−2 and an external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of 01 % 11  Recently  an EQE of 85 % was reported for methylammonium lead bromide ( MAPbBr3 ) -based green LEDs12 and 35 % for methylammonium lead iodide ( MAPbI3 ) -based near-infrared LEDs13  which are the highest EQEs reported so far for PeLEDs composed of pure MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 films  respectively  More recently  an EQE of 88 % was achieved for near-infrared LEDs using layered PEA2 ( CH3NH3 ) n−1PbnI3n+1 ( PEA = C8H9NH3  phenylethylammonium ) perovskite films14 and an EQE of 117 % was achieved by introducing excess large group ammonium halides in the precursor15  Despite these high efficiencies  the stability of the device under electric bias has not been well studied  A well-known weakness of OIP is that they are moisture-sensitive and can degrade to PbX2 after exposure to air  Besides material degradation  perovskite solar cell device also suffered significantly from electrical bias in different condition161718192021  Tomas et al  found out that the application of an electric field in inert conditions lead to reversible degradation of perovskite thin film  but in presence of moisture lead to irreversible degradation16  Soohyun et al  revealed that perovskite solar cell is severely degraded under forward bias ( > 1 V )  even with dark condition17  Deng et al  monitored the electric field induced both irreversible ( > 04 V μm−1 ) and reversible ( < 04 V μm−1 ) PL response in CH3NH3PbI3 in air with a relative humidity of 40 % 18  Yuan et al  presented a reversible conversion between MAPbI3 and lead iodide phases under a small electric field ( 3 V μm−1 ) in air19  Recently  Zhao et al  observed an interesting phenomenon that for pure MAPbI3 PeLEDs under the influence of subsequent electrical scans  the EQE was improved from an initial 59 % to 74 % 22  This observation is different from what are often observed  where electrical bias/scan generally degrade the device  It was suspected that ion migration is the root cause of this improvement in Zhao ’ s experiment  There is a pressing need for understanding the mechanisms behind  In this work  electrical bias effect on PeLED has been systematically studied  It is shown that electrical bias can improve or degrade the device performance depending on the magnitude of the bias  By investigating absorbance  SEM surface image and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ( EDX ) data including point and mapping analysis of perovskite layer before and after electrical bias  the improvement and degradation effect under different electrical bias can be understood  Experimental Section Synthesis of MAPbBr3 Nanocrystals First MABr was synthesized by mixing the same mole ratio of methylamine ( 30 % in methanol ) and hydrobromic acid ( 48 % in water ) at 0 °C for 2 h with stirring  The precipitate was collected by evaporation of solvent at 60 °C for 1 h and purified the products by dissolving in ethanol  recrystallizing from diethl ether five times and finally dried in vacuum for 24 h For MAPbBr3 synthesis  a 200 μL solution containing 01 mmol PbBr2  015 mmol MABr  20 μL oleylamine and 500 μL oleic acid in dimethylformamide were added into 10 ml toluene at room temperature to produce the colloidal solution  Acetonitrile was added as a demulsifier in the demulsion process  The green product was collected after centrifugation at 5500 rpm for 4 min  then the precipitates were dissolved into 1 ml n-hexane  a bright green supernatant was obtained after another centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 4 min  Fabrication of PeLEDs MAPbBr3 perovskite LEDs were fabricated using ITO patterned glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1  ITO substrates were sequentially cleaned using soapy water  deionized water  isopropylalcohol  and acetone in ultrasonicator for 20 min each  and then treated with O2 plasma for 30 min prior to film deposition  PEDOT : PSS was spin-coated onto ITO substrates at 3000 rpm followed by thermal annealing at 130 °C for 20 min in air  Then these ITO substrates were transferred into N2 glove box for further use  TFB in chlorobenzene was spin-coating on top of PEDOT : PSS at 4000 rpm  baked at 120 °C for 20 min  Perovskite were deposited at 2000 rpm without any annealing  Finally  TPBi  LiF and Al were deposited using thermal evaporation at rate of 10  01 and 10 nm s−1  respectively  under a high vacuum ( < 15 × 10−6 Torr )  The device area was 2 × 2 mm2  Characterization The EL spectra of the PeLED were measured with a fiber optic spectrometer ( Ocean Optics USB2000 )  Device performance was achieved consisting with a calibrated PIN-25D silicon photodiode  a dual-channel Keithley 2614B source measure unit  Light emitted from PeLEDs was absorbed by the photodiode  which had a known responsivity and was measured as photodiode current  which were monitored by Keithley source  Then these two quantities were used to calculate the EQE  Surface image

transporting layer respectively  TPBi as electron transporting layer  The current density vs voltage curve is shown in Fig  1a  which is clearly a rectifying curve of a diode  The corresponding luminance and external quantum efficiency curve is shown in Fig  1a  b  with a maximum luminance of 15000 cd m−2 and a EQE of 4 % at 916 mA cm−2  revealing a relatively good performance  The roll-off started at 8 V  which is no significant break down during our measurement ( Fig  S2  Supporting Information )  Figure 1 figure 1 ( a ) Current density and luminance versus voltage and ( b ) EQE versus current density of PeLED measured after fabrication  Full size image Interestingly  we find that the luminance and EQE first increase and then decrease after several electrical scans ( Fig  2a  b )  As shown in Fig  2b  EQE increased at the second measurement  then decreased after the third measurement  But there is little change in J-V curves  as shown in Fig  S3  which indicates low emitting efficiency of PeLED  The enhancement under low current density is due to the motion of excess ions22  like excess MA or bromide in perovskite nanocrystals fill vacancies and reduce the defects  but under high current density  the degradation of perovskite film leading to more defects  which in turn decrease device performance  The same phenomenon also happens in luminance ( Fig  2a )  Figure 2 figure 2 ( a ) Luminance versus voltage and ( b ) EQE versus current density of PeLED with subsequent scans  Full size image In order to understand the reason behind this decrease in performance  we have applied different electrical biases to the PeLEDs ( Fig  3 )  Figure 3a shows the variation curve of EQE under 3 V bias for one minute  The EQE of PeLED under 3 V bias has the same trend as device without any bias  The EQE can be improved almost 20 % at 15 mA cm−2 after 3 V 10 seconds bias  but decreases with continues bias  After applying the bias for one minute  the EQE decreased by 51 % at the current of 50 mA cm−2  The variation curves of EQE under 4 V  5 V and 6 V biases are different from that of 3 V bias  which shows only decay with continue electrical bias  Under 4 V continues bias ( Fig  3b )  the EQE are dramatically decreased from 38 % to 14 % within 10 s bias stress  then decreased to 05 % after another 50 s The PeLED devices immediately failed under 5 V and 6 V bias stress for 10 s Figure 3 figure 3 EQE versus current density of PeLED under different electrical bias ( a ) 3 V  ( b ) 4 V  ( c ) 5 V  ( d ) 6 V Full size image To identify the degradation products left behind after the electrical bias  we further characterize the perovskite film by measuring absorption and fluorescence microscope  In Fig  4a  we plot the absorption of perovskite film after different electrical bias  As electrical bias increases  we observed a reduction in absorption which means the degradation of perovskite film  The fluorescence microscope images indicate that the emission of perovskite film under UV light is relative uniform without electrical bias  After electrical bias  perovskite films start to degrade which shows that there is no emission for some areas sparsely distributed across the area examination  To further confirm the degradation of perovskite film  X-ray diffraction was performed  which observed the decrease of peaks intensity for perovskite crystals ( Fig  S4a )  And after the electrical bias  the diffraction peak of PbBr2 appears ( Fig  S4b )  which means PbBr2 is one of decomposed products  Figure 4 figure 4 ( a ) Absorbance of

PSS/TFB/perovskite  LiF/Al was removed by tape  The scale bar is 100 μm )  Full size image To further investigate the degradation mechanisms of perovskite film under electrical bias  we analyzed EDX elements distribution under different electrical bias  Figure 5 displays the morphology of perovskite film driven in one minute at three different voltages ( 0  3  and 5 V )  As seen in Fig  5a  the perovskite film has smooth morphology  Significant islands start to appear after reaching 3 V bias in one minute  and the number of these islands grows with the increase of the electrical bias accordingly  In order to find out the elemental composition of the island  we conducted the EDX point analysis  shown in Fig  5d  which contains Pb and Br only  But C  N  Pb and Br can be detected in perovskite film before electrical bias  shown in Fig  S5  And XPS results ( Fig  S6 ) show that there is no Pb metal peak after electrical bias  So combining with the XRD  XPS and EDX results  the possible mechanism of degradation is shown as follows1924 : begin { array } { c } { { rm { CH } } } _ { 3 } { { rm { NH } } } _ { 3 } { { rm { PbBr } } } _ { 3 } to { { rm { CH } } } _ { 3 } { { { rm

different electrical bias  To observe degradation induced by electrical bias  biasing tests were conducted under different voltage  Under low electrical bias  the efficiency can be improved  owing to the excess ions ( like Br− ) filling vacancies  On the other hand  under long time operation or high electrical bias  the performance will immediately decay  mainly due to degradation of the perovskite film  Additionally  the degradation rate of perovskite depends on the magnitude of the forward electric bias  This work highlights the necessity of further research to improve the stability of PeLEDn this study  quick route-coating is practiced to substitute methyl ammonium ( MA ) cation with formamidinium ( FA ) at different ratios  Through optimizing the MA : FA ratio  a maximum power

solar cell with HCl as an additive Article 16 February 2024 1 Introduction Over the past few years  the use of traditional forms of energy  such as fossil fuels  has declined due to the serious environmental problems that they cause [ 1 ]  In the face of these problems  man has looked for clean and renewable forms of energy [ 2 ]  As the literature shows  the research on perovskites has been so intense that  after only a few years  the efficiency of PSCs has increased dramatically from 38 to 221 % [ 3  4 ]  The prominent performance of PSCs takes benefit of some unrivaled properties of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites  such as high-light absorption  acceptable optical band gap  long diffusion length of carriers [ 5 ]  adjustable direct band gap  and ability of charge separation and transport [ 6 ]  Yet  a vital issue that remains to resolve is the stability of devices [ 7 ]  Generally  perovskite materials that are based on organic–inorganic hybrids have ABX3 structures  where A position is a large cation in a single or combined form such as methyl ammonium ( CH3NH3+ or MA+ ) or formamidinium ( HC ( NH2 ) 2+ or FA+ )  B position represents a bivalent metal compound-like Pb+  Sn+  Ga+  and X position is an anion  such as I  Br  Cl or a mixed ratio of halogens [ 8 ]  Miyasaka group used it in dye-sensitized solar cells ( DSSCs ) as a light harvester [ 9 ]  MAPbI3 is the most prevalent perovskite material in the structure of PSCs  but it shows drastic instability [ 10 ]  To attain PSCs with much better performance and reasonable stability  it is necessary to control the morphological and optoelectronic properties of perovskite layers [ 11 ]  One of the efficient ways of adjusting and enhancing the optoelectronic properties of PSCs is compositional engineering in which cations and halides are used in different ratios [ 12  13 ]  MAPbI3 perovskites possess a desirable capability of absorption throughout the visible range in the spectrum ( with the band gap of 157 eV )  but they suffer a structural phase transition at nearly 55 °C  which converts a tetragonal phase to a cubic one  In addition  thermal destruction and decomposition occur above 100 °C  This can adversely affect the device performance and stability  Thus  MAPbI3 is inappropriate for long-time exposure to environmental conditions [ 14  15 ]  As a substitute  an alternative material is needed with a lower band gap and longer stability so as to make PSCs efficient  A promising alternative is formamidinium ( FAPbI3 )  Application of FA+ cations leads to a red shift at the onset of light absorbance and the improvement of light harvesting  This occurs due to the modified metal-halide-metal bond angle and the larger ionic radius of FA+ than MA+  It provides a narrower band gap ( 148 eV ) [ 16  17 ]  More importantly  FAPbI3 films present a longer charge diffusion length  better stability and higher charge mobility as compared to MAPbI3 films [ 18 ] Composition engineering for perovskite structures has proved to be an efficient way to upgrade the performance and properties of perovskite cells  This can be done through adjusting the ratio of the mixed materials in perovskites  especially the combination of cations [ 12  19  20 ] We have  however  developed a novel technique to reach excellent and pinhole-free films  In this regard  additive engineering  as compared to other methods  is a useful technique to obtain high-quality perovskite films with larger crystal grains and lower defects [ 21 ]  So far  different types of additives have been used to dope perovskite films  such as inorganic and organic salts  acids  fullerenes  and polymers  Briefly  the quality and crystallinity of perovskites have been improved through the additive doping of perovskite layers  This process leads to the formation of a dense layer  providing PSCs with more stability [ 22 ]  With the incorporation of additional molecules/polymers into perovskite films  defects are passivated by bonding interactions [ 21 ]  Oxygen atoms in a polymer can form hydrogen bonds with H atoms in a perovskite cation  leading to high stability and resistance against environmental conditions [ 23 ]  In addition  S and N atoms in a polymer have a pair of electrons which interact with Pb ions strongly and can stabilize the frame structure  Through incorporation of polymer additives into perovskite films  crystallization is promoted  the growth kinetics of crystalsis optimized  and device performance is improved  Herein  first  composition engineering is applied to PSCs by the alteration of the cation ratio ( MAI and FAI ) ; it is a quick one-step technique to make smooth and dense mixed perovskite films ( MAXFA1−XPbI3 ; X = 0  02  05  08  1 ) for mesostructured PSCs without any HTMs  After optimal mixed-cation PSCs ( MA08FA02PbI3 ) were obtained via J–V characterization  different additives ( ie  PVA  PVP  PEG and EC ) each with a certain weight percentage ( about 3 wt % compared to PbI2 ) were incorporated into the perovskite layers  This leads to an obvious improvement in PCE and stability  Then  the morphology  crystal structure  optical absorption  photovoltaic properties  carrier transport dynamic  and resistance were studied as the function of different MA : FA ratios and the kind of additives  2 Experimental details 21 Preparation of the perovskite A perovskite solution was prepared through dissolving PbI2 ( 461 mg ) in a mixed solvent of N  N-dimethyl formamide ( DMF ) /dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) ( V/V : 4/1 ) The solution was heated at 70 °C for 60 min so as to solve the PbI2 completely  After cooling  different amounts of a combination of MAI and FAI were added to the solution under stirring at room temperature to obtain MAxFA1−xPbI3 ( x = 0–1 ) perovskite  Synthesis of MAI and FAI powder was explained in S1 section in Supporting Information  Finally  polyethylene glycol ( PEG )  polyvinyl pyrrolidine ( PVP )  polyvinyl alcohol ( PVA ) and ethyl cellulose ( EC ) were added to an optimum composition of perovskite in 3 wt % versus PbI2 as an additive  and the product was stirred at room temperature overnight  22 Device fabrication First  a thick TiO2 compact layer containing titanium tetra-iso-propoxide ( TTIP ) and 2 M HCl in absolute ethanol was coated on an FTO substrate by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 40 s and then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min  After that  a diluted paste of TiO2 nanoparticles ( 25 nm ) was spin coated at 4000 rpm for 40 s to be used as a mesoporous layer for electron transporting  In the next step  to synthesize a cation-mixed perovskite layer ( MAxFA1−xPbI3 ) and an optimum mixed perovskite ( MA08FA02PbI3 ) with additives ( PEG  PVP  PVA and EC ) on a TiO2 layer  the prepared solutions were deposited through spin coating in a quick step  Photovoltaic parameters and J–V curves of mixed PSCs was mentioned in Supporting Information ( S3 )  In this way  the solutions were dropped on the substrate to completely cover it  It was then spun at 4000 rpm for 12 s  and 150 µl of diethyl ether as an anti-solvent was drop-coated within 5 s of spinning  This led to the formation of a shining brown layer  while the sample was exposed to a nitrogen flux  Then  the perovskite films were held at an optimized temperature for 30 min to become high-quality with the least undesirable yellow phase of FAI  There were no HTMs in the samples  Eventually  after masking  a 60-nm layer of Au was sputtered [ 24 ]  23 Characterization The X-ray Diffraction ( XRD ) of the perovskite films were measured with a D8 advanced diffractometer ( Bruker  Germany ) to study their crystal structure  UV–Vis absorptions were characterized with a SPECORD 250 spectrometer ( Analytik Jena AG  Germany )  The investigation of the surface morphology was performed with a scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) VEGA3 TESCAN  Current density–voltage ( J–V ) characterization was done for the solar cells with Keithely 2400 and a solar simulator under 15 AM at 100 mw/cm2  The photoluminescence ( PL ) spectra of the cells were derived by FL_Ar  ( Iran )  and electrical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS ) was done by means of an Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat model PGSTAT 30 ( Eco chemic Utrecht  Netherlands ) in dark  In addition  Sharif Solar IPCE-020 was used to measure the IPCE  and FTIR spectroscopy was carried out with Bruker  EQUINOX ( Germany )  3 Results and discussion Figure 1a shows the schematic diagram of the preparation process of the uniform and excellent-quality perovskite layers employed in this study  The detailed information is provided in the experimental section  The device architecture is presented in Fig  1b  As it can be seen in this figure  compact TiO2  mesoporous TiO2  perovskite and Au are coated consecutively on an FTO substrate  Fig  1 figure 1 a Schematic display of the preparation process  b schematic display of the device structure Full size image The molecular structures of the additives used in this study are shown in Fig  2  whose functional groups are responsible for the interaction with the perovskite component  Fig  2 figure 2 The chemical structures of polymer additives with their functional groups Full size image PVP can be a suitable additive because it has a strong polar C=O bond  with which it interacts with the components of perovskites and stabilizes crystal structures  PVP is rich in lewis base pyridine groups  PEG has an excellent property of retaining moisture  PEGs with low-molecular weights are hygroscopic in nature  These polymers have low toxicity and are used in a variety of products  They contain O atoms and interact with perovskites via strong hydrogen bonds with the H atoms in them [ 25 ]  PVA is stable  non-toxic  odorless and eco-friendly in dry conditions  For fabrication of films  it has high tension  flexibility and chemical resistance  It is also resistant to penetration of vapors and gasses and creates strong bonds with perovskite atoms  EC  as a subset of the cellulose family  is low-cost  safe for health and abundantly found in earth  The unique and attractive EC is suitable for doping in perovskites  This is owing to its hydrogen bonds  thermal and light stability  and ability to stabilize crystal structures and modify charge mobility and transition  To examine the phase purity of the synthesized perovskite film  XRD characterization was conducted ( Fig  3 )  As a matter of fact  there are perovskite peaks in all samples  As Fig  3 shows  there is a very fine and negligible peak for PbI2 at 126°  which is related to non-reacted PbI2  The perovskite peaks are located around 14°  20°  24°  28°  32°  40° and 42°  According to zoomed-XRD patterns ( Fig  3b )  the incorporation of additives pushes the peak position toward larger angles and changes the perovskite crystal structure  Samples with PVA and PVP have higher peaks intensity  which indicates better crystallinity  In addition  samples possess a larger full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) This hold true particularly about the samples containing PEG and EC  which are smaller in size according to the Debye–Scherrer relation [ 26 ]  In our study  introducing of additives in precursors prevented mass diffusion and provided smaller grains in the films  Fig  3 figure 3 a The XRD patterns of optimal perovskite films ( MA08FA02PbI3 ) with and without additives ( PVA  PVP  PEG and EC )  b the enlarged XRD patterns for all the samples around 14° and 28° Full size image The presence of polymers in perovskite films and the bonding interaction between perovskite and polymer could be evaluated by Fourier transform infrared ( FTIR ) spectroscopy  The samples were provided by the same method of device fabrication  In Fig  4  the FTIR spectra in the area of 4000–1000 cm−1 are presented for pure polymer and perovskite–polymer films  As it can be seen in Fig  4a  the main spectral features to be considered for the PVP film are the C–N stretching at 1273 cm−1 and the carbonyl group vibration ( C=O ) at 1680 cm−1  For the PVP-treated perovskite film  the peaks shift to a lower wavenumber as the C=O peak moves to 1642 cm−1  which can be attributed to the strong interaction between the electron pair of the oxygen atom in the C=O bond of PVP and Pb2+ ions [ 27  28 ]  The pure EC spectrum ( Fig  4b ) has a broad peak at about 1051 cm−1 which is related to the C–O stretching vibration contributed by oxygen in ether  hydroxyl and heterocycle units  However  as the perovskite-EC film indicates  the C–O peak moves to 963 cm−1  This change may be due to the interaction of the oxygen in EC with the Pb2+ in perovskite through Lewis acid-base reaction [ 29  30 ]  Figure 4c shows the pure PVA spectrum with a wide peak for the OH stretching vibration in 3332 cm−1 and a sharp peak for the C–O bond around 1243 cm−1  However  once the perovskite is doped with PVA  the peaks shift to a lower wavenumber  This is similar to what occurs in the case of PVP  Finally  several strong peaks of PEG and perovskite-PEG can be seen in Fig  4d  There is a C–H bond near 2882 cm−1 and a sharp peak of C–O at 1096 cm−1  After the PEG polymer is added to the perovskite film  the peaks shift to a lower wavenumber  The C–O peak of the perovskite-PEG film located at 961 cm−1 is related to the interaction of the polymer and the perovskite component  Fig  4 figure 4 FTIR spectra of a PVP and perovskite-PVP  b EC and perovskite-EC  c PVA and perovskite-PVA  and d PEG and perovskite-PEG Full size image In Fig  5a  the UV–Vis absorption spectra illustrates an increased absorption at all the wavelengths for the samples with PVA and PVP additives  leading to the enhancement of charge injection and PCE in the cells  This enhancement is attributed to the more favorable morphology and the improved carrier transport dynamics in the perovskite films  On the other hand  after the addition of EC and PEG  The absorption increased over the wavelength of 500 to near 650 and 700 nm  respectively  and then it dropped slightly  This rise and fall was due to the increment of the grain size in the crystal as well as the interaction between the perovskite and the additives  Figure 5b shows the optical band gap changes that occur due to the addition of different polymer additives to the optimal mixed perovskite  The optical band gaps for the perovskites with no additives and with PVA  PVP  PEG and EC were 151  145  148  152 and 149 eV  respectively  Fig  5 figure 5 a The UV–Vis absorption spectra  b The Tauc plots for the optimal perovskite film ( MA08FA02PbI3 ) with and without additives ( PVA  PVP  PEG and EC ) Full size image Top-view scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) was carried out to investigate the morphology of the films with additives  The SEM images ( Fig  6 ) clearly indicated some morphological differences created by the incorporation of additives ( PVA  PVP  PEG and EC )  The perovskite films gained a dense layer and a deformed surface ( like flowers for PVP and EC and islands for PVA and PEG )  It seems that the deformation of the film surface could modify the charge transfer path and passivate the traps  Thus  the recombination of charges was reduced in the perovskite layer and the interface spatially  and the current density and the efficiency of the device were increased subsequently  Fig  6 figure 6 S1–S4 The SEM images of the optimal mixed perovskite films ( MA08FA02PbI3 ) treated with different additives ( S1 PEG )  ( S2 PVP )  ( S3 PVA ) and ( S4 EC ) Full size image After the incorporation of additives  the degradation of the perovskite films decelerated  which was proved by the contact angle measurements as shown in Fig  7  The water contact angles of the PEG ( S1 )  PVP ( S2 )  PVA ( S3 ) and EC ( S4 ) -doped perovskite films were 38°  68°  53° and 49° respectively  For PVA and PVP  the contact angles significantly increased  preventing the moisture attack on the perovskite films  However  the PEG and EC perovskite films had lower contact angles  and those films underwent more degradation along with the change of color from black to yellow  Fig  7 figure 7 The water contact angles on the perovskite films with different additives  ie  PEG ( S1 )  PVP ( S2 )  PVA ( S3 ) and EC ( S4 ) -doped perovskite films  are 38°  68°  53°and 49° respectively Full size image Figure 8a presents the current density–voltage ( J–V ) curves of the optimal perovskite solar cells containing different additives ( PVA  PVP  PEG and EC )  As it was discovered  the optimal mixed perovskite films in the absence of additives had the PCE of 831 %  the JSC of 1902 mA/cm2  the VOC of 0859 V  and FF of 5088 %  After treatment with the additives  however  an obvious improvement occurred in the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells  The best performance in the treated optimal PSCs was achieved by the incorporation of the PVA additive  yielding a PCE of 1276 %  JSC of 2197 mA/cm2  VOC of 0919 V and FF of 6320 %  In comparison  the other PSCs doped by PVP  PEG and EC had the PCE of 1128  1038 and 892 %  VOC of 0910  0890 and 0879 V  JSC of 2175  2052 and 1958 mA/cm2 and FF of 5697  5681 and 5108 %  respectively  The enhancement in the performance of the PSCs treated by additives can be ascribed to their matched band gap  modified crystal structure  improved charge injection  and reduced charge accumulation and recombination  all of which were confirmed through PL and EIS analyses  It also seems that different additives may differently passivate the defects in perovskite grains  which can improve the FF parameter of PSCs  So  as it appears  using additives ( polymers ) with different functional groups leads to interactions with perovskites  and this  in turn  results in passivation  Fig  8 figure 8 aJ–V curves of the optimal mixed PSCs with PVA  PVP  PEG and EC  b device stability of the optimal mixed perovskite solar cells with and without additive treatment under ambient air conditions at room temperature without encapsulation for more than 2 months Full size image The influence of additive treatment on the stability of the optimal mixed PSCs was studied  and the PCEs of the PSCs were investigated under ambient conditions at room temperature with no encapsulation in 20 % humidity for more than 2 months  According to Fig  8b  all of the devices with and without additives gained a slightly increased PCE after a day from the first J–V measurement  which could be because of the improved contacting features at the interfaces between the layers [ 31 ]  After about 20 days  the PCE of the reference PSC ( ie  the one without additives ) was reduced severely  but the devices passivated by additive treatment showed better stability  especially the ones treated with EC and PVP  This was proved by the water contact angle tests on different perovskites  Generally  after about 2 months  the cells with EC  PVP  PEG and PVA showed diminished PCE at different rates  Incorporation of EC  PVP  PEG and PVA into the perovskite films led to 7495  7358  4484 and 3479 % of their best PCE values for over two months  respectively  The sample with PVA experienced faster degradation than the others  which was probably because of the appearance of the defects on the surface exposed to the light  enhanced charge accumulation and recombination  conversion of the perovskite phase to a non-perovskite phase and destruction of contact properties  Figure 9 indicates the statistics of 10 devices for each cell type  There are box plots given of JSC  VOC  FF and PCE for devices with and without different additives  The average statistical values for the JSC  VOC  FF and PCE of the devices point to characteristics similar to those for the best-performing devices in Table 1  Fig  9 figure 9 Statistical results for aJSC  bVOC  c FF and d PCE

spectroscopy  the incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency ( IPCE ) can be measured to specify the ratio of the extracted electrons to the incident photons at a given wavelength  This directly addresses JSC and its validity  Figure 10 presents the IPCE spectra of mixed PSCs with and without different polymer additives ( PVA  PVP  PEG and EC )  As it can be seen  in comparison with the IPCE spectra of the cells without polymer treatment  those of the additive-treated cells broaden significantly in a wide wavelength range from 400 to 750 nm  Generally  as the wavelength rises from 350 to 400 nm  the IPCE value is enhanced for all the samples but then remains almost constant in a broad range ; the gradual decline in this case can be ignored  Finally  it decreases drastically with further rise in the wavelength  It is also noted that the IPCE response onset about 800 nm is in agreement with the absorption onset of the perovskite layer in Fig  5  Fig  10 figure 10 IPCE curves of PSCs with and without additives ( PVA  PVP  PEG and EC ) Full size image Figure 11a displays the steady-state photoluminescence ( PL ) quenching of the perovskite films with and without additives  This measurement was performed to analyze the carrier transport dynamic and  thereby  to investigate the mechanism involved in the modified photovoltaic performance of PSCs with and without additives  As it can be seen in the figure  through the incorporation of additives  the PL spectra change clearly  and the PL quenching of the devices is enhanced with PVA and PVP additives  as compared to PEG and EC  A device with PVA presents the best PL quenching  implying more effective electron injection into the electron transport layer ( TiO2 ) as well as the inhibition of charge recombination through the passivation of the traps [ 32  33 ]  Fig  11 figure 11 a Steady-state PL spectra  b the Nyquist plots of optimal PSCs with different additives for evaluation of EIS Full size image Electrical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS ) was done to explain the altered charge transport resistance in PSCs with and without different additives ( ie  PVA  PVP  PEG and EC )  as presented in Fig  11b  The Nyquist plots of the devices were obtained at 08 V within the frequency range of 1 MHz to 100 mHz in dark  An equivalent circuit was used for the device to fit the EIS data as reported in the Figure  The charge transport resistance of the PSCs with PVA  PVP  EC and PEG were found to be 200  275  468 and 812 Ω respectively  The charge transport resistance obviously decreased for all the samples treated with additives  as compared to the device without any additives  This was due to the growth of FF in the corresponding PSCs  What occurred in this case actually reveals the improvement of charge injection in devices  4 Conclusion In summary  a quick technique was used to fabricate smooth and dense ( MAXFA1−XPbI3 ) mixed-cation perovskite films for light harvesting in mesostructured PSCs  The highest PCE of 831 % belonged to the MA08FA02PbI3composition  as optimal mixed PSCs  Composition engineering  thus  proved to be an effective approach to improve the performance of PSCs  To enhance the performance  stability  carrier transport  surface modification and interface properties of the cells  several additives including PVA  PVP  PEG and EC ) were used in the perovskite layers

great deal of attention because of their low-cost  facile solution-processible manufacturing and high photovoltaic performance12 MAPbX3 ( MA = CH3NH3  X = Cl  Br  I ) as photo-active materials of PSC devices exhibit unique optical and electronic properties such as high absorption coefficients  long charge carrier diffusion lengths3–5 low exciton binding energy6 ambipolar charge transport7 and photon recycling properties8 The power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of PSC devices has increased from 38 % up to a certified efficiency of 227 % in only five years9 thanks to the improvement of solvent engineering  deposition methods and device architecture10–12 which allow the growth of MAPbX3 with the desired morphology and high crystallinity  Generally  the perovskite layer can be prepared by either one-step coating or sequential two-step coating methods  In both methods  growth of intermediate phases during the conversion of lead-halides to perovskite crystals is critical for the formation of the perovskite layer13 It is well accepted and illustrated in the literature that the morphological manipulation could be beneficial to facilitate film reconstruction and accelerate crystallization kinetics in perovskite materials1415 In addition  high crystallinity with minimum defects is a critical factor for high quality perovskite films to achieve high photovoltaic performances1617 Hence  much effort has recently been made to control the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite film using various solvent engineering methods111819 Until now  different solvents have been applied with various strategies during the device fabrication process to attain a complete conversion of lead-halides to perovskite crystals  thus forming a pinhole-free perovskite film1320–22 Zuo et al20 exposed mixed perovskite precursor films to saturated vapor atmospheres of N  N-dimethylformamide ( DMF ) and dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO )  resulting in highly crystalline perovskite films that afford a PCE of up to192 %  Tu et al1 have completely removed residual PbI2 and converted the precursor into a high-quality perovskite film by solvent engineering with isopropyl alcohol rather than using the common thermal annealing of the PbI2 film  Recently  Fang21 investigated the impact of the toluene drop-casting process during spin-coating as a solvent engineering technique on quality of the perovskite films  With no annealing posttreatment  they successfully fabricated a high quality perovskite film with a uniform microstructure and high crystallinity  Diethyl ether was used by Ahn and co-workers13 to improve the perovskite film quality  Employment of diethyl ether during spin-coating of perovskite solution resulted in elimination of a Department of

the perovskite film associated with a crystallinity improvement under different atmospheric conditions was reported by Liu et al22 Triethylenetetramine ( TETA ) has various clinical applications in particular as a potent telomerase inhibitor in the biomedical industry23–25 TETA has a strong chelating capability with metal ions  which makes it suitable for potential application as the growth-orientator of nanomaterials26 To the best of our knowledge  there is no report on the use of TETA to control the orientation of perovskite crystals in PSC applications  In the present work  PbI2 is dissolved in a mixture of DMF and DMSO  followed by deposition of perovskite films on compact/mesoporous TiO2 underlayers through a commonly used sequential two-step method  Moreover  a vapor assisted solution process ( VASP ) is exploited to heal the morphology of the perovskite films by exposing the samples to MAI vapor  Subsequently  solvent engineering is carried out by applying TETA on either PbI2 or perovskite films  Some conventional solvents including isopropyl alcohol ( IPA )  acetone ( ACE )  diethyl ether ( DEE ) and dichloromethane ( DCM ) are also used for the solvent engineering as comparative examples  Finally  PSC devices with the perovskite films solvent-engineered by TETA demonstrated a 55 % increase in photoconversion efficiency compared to the control devices with the perovskite films treated with conventional solvents  2  Experimental procedures 21  Materials A SnO2 : F ( FTO ) transparent conductive substrate  22′77′-tetrakis [ N  N-di ( 4-methoxyphenyl ) amino ] -99′-spirobifluorene ( Spiro OMeTAD ) and TiO2 paste were purchased from Solaronix  Titanium ( IV ) tetraisopropoxide ( TTIP  98 % )  dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO  999 % )  CH3NH3I ( MAI  99 % )  lead iodide ( PbI2  9999 % )  lithium bis ( trifluoromethane sulfonyl ) imide ( LiTFSI )  N  N-dimethyl formamide ( DMF  99 % ) and isopropyl alcohol ( IPA ) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and all of the reagents were used without further purification  22  PSC device fabrication FTO substrates were cut into 14 mm × 14 mm size and etched with Zn powder and hydrochloric acid  The patterned substrates were sequentially cleaned with detergent  deionized water  acetone and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath  Afterward  in order to prepare TiO2 sol  369 μL TTIP was dissolved in 253 mL ethanol and then a solution of 253 mL ethanol containing 35 μL HCl ( 37 % in water ) was added dropwise under stirring  A TiO2 compact layer as a blocking layer was deposited on FTO substrates by spin-casting of the TiO2 sol at 2000 rpm for 30 s followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min  Subsequently  a mesoscopic TiO2 scaffold with a thickness of ∼400 nm was spin coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s using commercial TiO2 paste diluted in ethanol  The deposited film was dried at 125 °C for 15 min and calcined at 500 °C for 30 minutes to eliminate the additives from the mesoscopic scaffold  Photo-active perovskite films were deposited by a sequential two-step method  First  13 M PbI2 solution was prepared in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO ( 4 : 1 )  70 μL PbI2 solution was spun onto the TiO2 mesoporous film and spincoated at 5000 rpm for 5 s with no post-annealing treatment  In the second step  the perovskite material was formed on PbI2-included substrates either by exposing to MAI vapor at 150 °C for 2 h or by spin-coating 200 μL MAI solution ( 10 mg mL−1 in IPA ) at 4000 rpm for 20 s after 60 s time-loading  A solvent treatment process was carried out by IPA  ACE  DEE  DCM and TETA after both deposition of the PbI2 layer and complete formation of the perovskite film  A solution of spiroOMeTAD as the hole-transporting material ( HTM ) was prepared by dissolving 723 mg of this compound in 1 mL chlorobenzene at room temperature  In order to improve its conductivity  288 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine ( TBP ) and 175 μL of a stock solution of Li-TFSI in acetonitrile ( 520 mg/1 mL ) were added into the solution27 All procedures were carried out under ambient air conditions of 30–35 % relative humidity  HTM was deposited by spin-coating of 70 μL spiro-OMeTAD solution at 4000 rpm for 20 s  followed by keeping in oxygen stream to encourage oxidation of the HTMs  Finally  a gold electrode with a thickness of about 80 nm was deposited by the vacuum evaporation method  23  Characterization and measurements Thin-film characterization was carried out by XRD  UV-vis absorption and FESEM  XRD measurements of the films were carried out using a PANalytical X ’ Pert Pro system with grazing incidence angle configuration  which is operated at 30 kV  10 mA at 2θ ( Cu Kα ) 10–80°  step size of 002°  and step time of 23° 1 min−1  Absorption spectra were recorded with an Avaspec 2048 TEC spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere detector  A field emission scanning electron microscope ( FESEM  Mira3 ) was used to study the surface morphology of the samples  The current–voltage characteristics of the PSC devices were measured using a Solar Simulator model no  SS150 with a Nova Sca current/voltage source  It should be noted that each batch included 5 different PSC devices and the average values were reported  The light intensity was calibrated at one Sun ( 100 mW cm−2  AM15G ) using a certified Fraunhofer CalLab reference cell  The perovskite cell was illuminated and maintained under open-circuit conditions until it reached a steady-state prior to the measurement  3  Results and discussion Fig  1 shows the schematic illustration of two different solvent engineering approaches ( ie  solvent engineering of either the PbI2 layer or perovskite film ) to form a uniform NH3CH3PbI3 film in mesoscopic PSC devices  Both approaches were started by spin coating the PbI2/DMF–DMSO solution on the substrates  For the solvent engineering of PbI2 ( ie  process A )  Photochemical & Photobiological Sciences Paper This

resulting in a shiny yellow film  The obtained film was annealed on a hot plate at 110 °C for 10 min and exposed to MAI vapor at 150 °C for 2 h For the solvent engineering of the perovskite ( ie  process B )  the PbI2/DMF–DMSO film was dried at 110 °C for 10 min  followed by exposing to MAI saturated vapor at 150 °C for 2 h  turning the sample ’ s color from yellow to dark-brown  The resulting perovskite layer was then exposed to a saturated vapor of TETA and a mixed solution of DCM/DEE ( 50–50 vol % )  and finally dried at 100 °C for 10 min  Fig  2 shows the XRD patterns of the perovskite films treated by two different solvent engineering routes  All X-ray diffractograms indicate similar peaks corresponding to the TiO2 underlying layer and the perovskite film on the top  The TiO2 layer is featured by two peaks at 2450° and 3780°  The peaks located at 1420°  2016°  2851° and 3192° were identified to the tetragonal perovskite phase diffracted from ( 1 1 0 )  ( 1 1 2 )  ( 2 2 0 ) and ( 3 1 0 ) crystal planes  respectively28 The residual PbI2  which has the strong characteristic peak at 2θ = 127° corresponding to the ( 0 0 1 ) plane22 was observed for the control layer ( ie  the sample with no solvent engineering )  On the other hand  the residual PbI2 was completely eliminated by washing the PbI2 layer in process ( A ) with solvents except for ACE  This shows partial decomposition of the perovskite film which is in agreement with the previous study22 Meanwhile  PbI2 solvent engineering by IPA  ACE and the IPA/ ACE mixture resulted in the appearance of some new peaks such as 1533° and 2601°  attributed to the presence of the intermediate phases21 No residual PbI2 was detected by solvent engineering of the perovskite film using TETA  The peaks attributed to the tetragonal perovskite phase obtained by process ( B ) ( ie  solvent engineering of perovskite ) using TETA and DCM/ DEE are much more intense than those achieved by process ( A ) ( ie  solvent engineering of PbI2 )  This means a higher degree of perovskite recrystallization  resulting in rearrangement of the grains into a more desirable packing orientation  It seems that TETA-vapor treatment allows penetration of the perovskite solution into the mesoscopic layer  where the perovskite crystals show different orientations compared to those in the capping layer  Moreover  a relative amount of perovskite material may have changed in the mesoscopic and capping layers after solvent treatment  thus affecting the intensity ratio of the peaks located at 1420° and 3192°29 Fig

perovskite films by : ( a ) process ( A ) ( ie  solvent washing of the premier PbI2 film ) and ( b ) process ( B ) ( ie  solvent washing of the final perovskite film )  Paper Photochemical & Photobiological Sciences 1230  Photochem  Photobiol  Sci  2019  18  1228–1234 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry and Owner Societies 2019 The top-view FESEM images of the perovskite films engineered by different solvents for PbI2 and CH3NH3PbI3 layers are presented in Fig  3  All VASP-treated perovskite films exhibited a continuous  smooth and full coverage texture with fairly uniform pinhole-free morphology and a sufficiently large grain size  It is evident that the solvent engineering protocol had important impact on the morphology and size distribution of the perovskite crystals  As shown in Fig  3a–c  a bimodal grain size  containing coarse ( more than 1 μm in diameter ) and fine ( 200 nm in diameter ) grains  was obtained for process ( A )  whereas uniform large perovskite crystals ( Fig  3d and e ) were achieved for VASP-treated films for process ( B )  This confirms crucial influence of the solvent engineering process on perovskite morphology for PSC devices  Some undesirable defects appeared in the form of narrow gaps at the grain-boundaries of perovskite polycrystals  Defects may act as trap centers for charge carriers  leading to a limit diffusion length and lifetime of electron–hole pairs in the perovskite absorbers  As shown in Fig  3e  the lowest density of such defects ( ie  the most compactly arranged structure ) was achieved for the TETA-treated perovskite film  This makes TETA as a promising candidate for solvent engineering of perovskite films for high-performance PSC devices  The UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite films treated by different solvents are shown in Fig  4  There is a clear absorption edge at about 780 nm  which corresponds to an optical band gap of 16 eV  The absorption onset edge of the perovskite films is not much affected using various solvent engineering protocols  The films produced by process ( A )  in particular by using the TETA solvent  showed stronger light Fig  3 FESEM

wavelengths compared to those treated by process ( B )  The high-level light absorbance of the TETA-treated film may be related to both the high crystallization degree of the perovskite film as an intensive light absorber  as verified by XRD analysis  and remarkable surface coverage of the perovskite film  as verified by FESEM graphs  The superior light absorption characteristics of the perovskite film lead to a high current yield in the PSC devices  which is discussed in the following  Fig  5 illustrates photocurrent density–voltage ( J–V ) curves of the PSC devices recorded under ambient air conditions  and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1  The solvent engineering approaches adopted in this work had beneficial impact on photovoltaic performance of PSC devices  However  the cells fabricated by process ( B )  solvent washing of the final perovskite film ( ie  Fig  5b )  showed higher PCEs than those treated by process ( A )  solvent washing of the premier PbI2 film ( ie  Fig  5a )  Amongst all fabricated PSCs  the one with the solvent engineered MAPbI3 film using TETA demonstrated the highest PCE of 771 % with a short-circuit current density ( JSC ) of 2044 mA cm−2  an opencircuit voltage ( VOC ) of 081 V and a fill factor ( FF ) of 046  The control device with no solvent engineering showed a lower PCE of 495 % with a JSC of 1354 mA cm−2  a VOC of 082 V and a FF of 044  Since the devices were constructed under ambient air conditions of 30–35 % relative humidity  the highest achieved PCE in the present work is lower than that of those prepared in the glove box with a PCE beyond 22 %  When a mixture of IPA/ACE was applied on a lead iodide film in process ( A )  the device yielded better photovoltaic performance than those layers treated by pure IPA or ACE separately  Keeping in mind XRD and FESEM analyses  we can declare that IPA/ACE-treatment of the PbI2 film has positive impact not only on annihilating the impurities from the surface of the perovskite film  but also converting the residual PbI2 into the perovskite compound  Such structural modification of the perovskite film induced an improved photovoltaic performance of PSC devices  thanks to JSC enhancement  For process ( B )  solvent engineering with TETA and DCM/ DEE improved cell efficiency in comparison with the control device ( eg  sufficiently higher JSC for TETA  and mildly higher JSC and VOC for DCM/DEE )  The fact that the DCM/DEE-treated perovskite film contained some PbI2 impurity ( Fig  3 )  but its PSC device showed better cell performance compared with the devices using the perovskite films fabricated by process ( A ) suggests that the different crystal orientation of the perovskite film treated with DCM/DEE is beneficial for improving the cell performance  The TETA-treated perovskite film had similar crystal orientation to the DCM/DEE treated film  but it had non-detectable residual PbI2 ( Fig  3 ) and the most desirable morphology ( Fig  2 )  leading to its highest PCE  4  Conclusions In summary  we demonstrated the critical role of the solvent engineering treatment in tailoring the residual PbI2 content and MAPbI3 film morphology in the two-step preparation method of the perovskite film for PSC devices  By solvent engineering of premier PbI2 and the final perovskite layers by various solvents  the morphology of the resulting films and  therefore  the photoconversion efficiency of devices were remarkably improved  We found that solvent engineering of the perovskite film had more impact on device performance than solvent engineering of the premier PbI2 layer  This was accompanied by introduction of TETA as a new and outstandDeveloping fabrication method without glove-box is essential to industrialize the revolutionary development of perovskite solar cell ( PSC )  In this paper  infrared irradiation during the fabrication process was studied for the preparation of perovskite absorber layer in air ambience  The infrared irradiation could reduce the ambience moisture  And more importantly  it could offer stereoscopic uniform thermal radiation during the fabrication process to help prepare uniform perovskite absorber layer with decreased annealing temperature  The solar cell structure was Au/spiro-OMeTAD/CH3NH3PbI3/mesoporous TiO2/compact TiO2/FTO glass  The Au electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation  And the functional thin films 〈spiro-OMeTAD/CH3NH3PbI3/mesoporous TiO2/compact TiO2〉 were prepared by spin coating/spin coating and immersion method/spin coating/spin coating  respectively  The experimental result indicates that uniform and smooth perovskite absorber layer with good optical absorption and relative low Rs and Rsh can be obtained by this route  The element distribution through the thin film is very uniform  demonstrating the perovskite is uniformly filled into the mesoporous TiO2 layer  The atom ratio of the Pb and I is estimated to be 1:24  The fabricated PSC shows short-circuit photocurrent density ( JSC ) of 2571 mA/cm2  open-circuit voltage ( VOC ) of 800 mV  fill factor ( FF ) of 4245 % and power

Tandem Application Article Open access 21 March 2023 Review on Chemical Stability of Lead Halide Perovskite Solar Cells Article Open access 31 March 2023 1 Introduction Generally  perovskite has the formula of ABX3  where A is CH3NH3+  CH ( NH2 ) 2+  or Cs+  B is Pb2+ or Sn2+  and X is I−  Br−  or Cl− [ 1 ]  The perovskite can be applied into many fields such as photovoltaic device  photodetector and photodiode [ 234 ]  Perovskite solar cell ( PSC ) is one of the photovoltaic devices and it has obtained tremendous attention since the perovskite was introduced into dye-sensitized solar cell as solid-state light absorber layer in 2009 [ 5 ]  The power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the PSC has been boosted rapidly and it has reached 252 % now [ 6 ]  which is comparable to other well-studied solar cells such as commercial polycrystalline silicon solar cells [ 7 ]  The successes of the PSC can be ascribed to two main aspects  One is for its excellent properties  such as high optical absorption coefficient  long carrier lifetime  balanced electron hole diffusion length and efficient ambipolar charge transport [ 5  8  9 ]  The other is for its important merit of low fabrication requirement  for example it can be fabricated by simple and inexpensive solution-based fabrication methods  which makes it emerge as one of the most promising solar cells now  Usually  the perovskite is prepared by one-step [ 10 ]  two-step [ 11 ]  or vapor deposition method [ 12 ] that could obtain high efficiency PSC  Choi et al  proposed the preparation of CH3NH3PbI3-based PSC by continuous megasonic spray coating method  They studied the dependence of the crystal structure  morphology  optical  and photovoltaic properties of the perovskite absorber layer on the megasonic spray coating scan speed and found that the PSC prepared at scan speed of 15 mm/s exhibited the best performance with PCE of 169 % [ 13 ]  Yu et al  employed the vacuum co-deposition method to fabricate perovskite absorber layer by controlling the CH3NH3I vapor pressure  They studied the influence of CH3NH3I vapor pressure on the crystal structure  morphological  optical  and photovoltaic properties of the prepared perovskite absorber layer  And they found that highly crystalline perovskite thin film with micrometer size grain could be prepared at an optimal vapor pressure of 45 ± 03 × 10−3 Pa  resulting into solar cell PCE of 1574 % [ 14 ]  Seo et al  prepared perovskite absorber layer by two consecutive spin coating steps  They proposed a device architecture for high efficient perovskite solar cells that use poly ( 3-hexylthiophene ) ( P3HT ) as a hole transport material without any dopants  A thin layer of wide-bandgap halide perovskite was formed on top of the narrow-bandgap light absorber layer by an in situ reaction of n-hexyl trimethyl ammonium bromide on the perovskite surface to promote the carrier utilization efficiency  This method resulted into solar cell with PCE high to 252 % [ 6 ]  The PSC with low fabrication requirement shows excellent properties  which has prompted great interest in its large-scale industrial production [ 15  16 ]  However  almost all of state-of-the-art PSC are fabricated inside glove-box with controlled atmospheric conditions  For example  most high efficient PSCs are prepared inside nitrogen- or argon-filled glove-box ( H2O < 01 ppm and O2 < 01 ppm )  This significantly limits the fabrication processes to scale up and also causes extra budget for atmosphere control during the fabrication [ 17  18 ]  Therefore  developing fabrication technology that could prepare perovskite material in air ambience is extremely crucial to the practical application of the PSC  Considering the use of an inert atmosphere in large-scale industrial solar cell production would result in significantly increased manufacturing cost  some studies have been conducted on the preparation of perovskite absorber layer under air ambience  And several fabrication methods such as anti-solvent [ 19 ]  dual-step thermal engineering technique [ 20 ] and crystal engineering [ 21 ] have been reported  Xu et al  deposited the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layer in air ambience by the anti-solvent ( chloroform ) washing method  Smooth and coverage perovskite absorber layer with PCE high to 1772 % can be obtained ( almost the highest efficiency PSC prepared under air ambience in despite of the usage of anti-solvent ) [ 19 ]  Roy et al  proposed a dual-step thermal engineering technique to prepare perovskite absorber layer in air ambience  They deposited perovskite absorber layer via precursor solution by spin coating on to a mildly hot substrate which was heated at 60 oC for 10 min and then annealed the prepared thin film at 80 °C for 30 min  They found the pre-heated substrate could effectively help the perovskite growth during fabrication process similarly as an epitaxial growth  and thus high quality perovskite absorber layer with PCE of 11 % could be obtain [ 20 ]  The property of the PSC prepared under air ambience is acceptable as compared to that prepared in inert conditions [ 20212223 ]  which offers a very promising way for the large-scale industrial production of PSC  However  there is an unsatisfactory aspect  The preparation of perovskite absorber layer in air ambience usually applied complex process with relatively high temperature post annealing  Typically  for the preparation of perovskite  after a solution containing CH3NH3I and lead halide salt was deposited onto the substrate through spin coating  a heat treatment at around 100 °C should be followed in almost all of the fabrication methods to evaporate residual solvent as well as to control the crystallization of the perovskite material [ 13  19 ]  However  the annealing temperature at around 100 °C is relatively high for many perovskite materials  since it may cause perovskite re-decomposition  And the high temperature process is also not good for thermal budget and feasible industrial production route [ 19 ]  In addition  Schmidt et al  have reported a successful application of a large-scale manufacturing procedure for perovskite solar cells under air ambience [ 242526 ]  They adopted pulsed infrared light to replace the high temperature as post annealing to drive the crystallization of perovskite absorber layer for the first time  By this way  a compact and pinhole-free perovskite absorber layer can be prepared successfully with a PCE exceeding 10 % [ 24 ]  With further research  they proposed a flash infrared annealing as a rapid fabrication method to prepare perovskite solar cell with PCE as high as 18 %  the similar optoelectronic performance in terms of photoluminescence spectra and impedance spectroscopy with anti-solvent method as mentioned above  Therefore  the infrared light offer a unique perspective for the fabrication of PSC [ 25 ]  However  the preparation of the perovskite absorber layer by this method is still operated inside the glove-box and the applied infrared light for annealing is high intensity  which is also not good for a feasible industrial production route and cost budget  In this work  a facile and efficient fabrication route has been studied for the preparation of PSC under air ambience  The method employed simple infrared lamp irradiation during the perovskite absorber layer preparation  to reduce the ambience moisture  to evaporate the residual solvent and to warm up the TiO2 substrate for perovskite deposition  After that  the prepared perovskite absorber layer was post annealed at a moderate temperature around 50 °C to improve the crystallization of the prepared perovskite material  This fabrication route could decrease the annealing temperature and avoid the usage of high intensity light for post annealing process  The morphological  optical  crystal structure  and photoelectric conversion properties of the prepared perovskite absorber layer were studied by scanning electron microscopy equipped with an X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometer  UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer  power X-ray diffraction and I-V test system  respectively  2 Experiment 21 Preparation of precursor solution All materials were purchased from commercial sources and used as received  The TiO2 solution was prepared by diluting commercial TiO2

ter-butylpyridine ( TBP )  175 µl of pre-prepared solution from 52 mg lithium bis ( trifluoromethanesulfonyl ) imide ( Li-TFSI ) in 100 µl acetonitrile and 1 ml chlorobenzene were mixed to prepare the hole transport layer ( HTL )  22 Fabrication of CH3NH3PbI3-based PSC The fluorine-doped tin oxide ( FTO ) glass etching by machining was cleaned by standard process  For the purpose of facile and efficient fabrication route  the TiO2 which was one of the most potential candidates for the preparation of many semiconductor devices was chosen as electrode for the solar cell and it was deposited by spin coating [ 27  28 ]  A compact TiO2 ( c-TiO2 ) layer was spin coated at 5000 rpm for 30 s and then was sintered at 500 oC for 30 min  A mesoporous TiO2 ( m-TiO2 ) layer was then followed onto the c-TiO2/FTO glass by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s and the prepared sample was sintered at 500 °C for 30 min again  The PbI2 layer was deposited into m-TiO2 by spin coating sequentially at 200 rpm for 5 s and 5000 rpm for 20 s The sample then was followed by annealing at 70 °C for 10 min  After cooling down to the room temperature  the PbI2/m-TiO2/c-TiO2/FTO glass sample was immersed into the CH3NH3I solution for 20 s to form CH3NH3PbI3/m-TiO2/c-TiO2/FTO glass  The prepared sample was rinsed with IPA and then was annealed for 5 min at moderate temperature of 50 °C by hot plate  The HTL was spin coated onto the annealed CH3NH3PbI3/m-TiO2/c-TiO2/FTO glass at 5000 rpm for 30 s All these steps were conducted in air ambience  The infrared irradiation was from a simple home-built lamp ( Philips  BR125  250W )  The sample was kept at 10 cm away from the irradiation source within ambience temperature of 35 to 40 °C  Finally  Au back contact ( 033 cm × 033 cm ) was thermally evaporated onto the top of the HTL/CH3NH3PbI3/m-TiO2/c-TiO2/FTO glass to obtain complete PSC  23 Characterization Surface morphology and structure of the prepared sample were characterized by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM  S-3400N  JEOL ) equipped with an X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometer ( EDS )  The crystalline property of the sample was conducted with power X-ray diffraction ( XRD  18KW/D/MAX 2550 VB  RIGAKU  Cu Kα radiation )  Ultraviolet–visible ( UV–Vis ) absorbance spectra of the sample were measured with an UV–Vis-NIR spectrophotometer ( Lambda 950  Varian )  The photocurrent density–voltage ( J–V ) property of the device was obtained with a keithley model 2400 digital source meter and a solar simulator ( Oriel Sol3A  Newport )  which was calibrated to AM 15  100 mW·cm-2 by a standard silicon photodiode  3 Results and discussion 31 Deposition of the m-TiO2 layer The rough and highly porous scaffold m-TiO2 thin film was proved to be an excellent host material for perovskite growth and its thickness can affect the perovskite deposition [ 29 ]  The cross morphology of the prepared m-TiO2 layer with various thickness was observed  as shown in Fig  1a  b  and c As can be seen from the images  the thickness of the prepared thin films increased obviously with the increased concentration of the TiO2 solution  And the thickness of the m-TiO2 layer was measured to be 160  380  and 680 nm for the samples C6  C4  C2  respectively  Therefore  the thickness of the m-TiO2 layer can be controlled by the concentration of the TiO2 solution  which is very useful for the controllable deposition of subsequent perovskite absorber layer  Fig  1 figure 1 Cross-sectional SEM of m-TiO2/glass prepared from different m-TiO2 concentration solution a 1:6 ( C6 )  b 1:4 ( C4 )  c 1:2 ( C2 ) Full size image To test the deposition condition of the perovskite on the m-TiO2 layer  the optical absorption characteristic of the fabricated CH3NH3PbI3/m-TiO2/c-TiO2/FTO glass was measured and the result is shown in Fig  2  In Fig  2  the CH3NH3PbI3/m-TiO2 ( C6  C4  C2 ) /c-TiO2/FTO glass prepared with infrared irradiation during the process exhibits better absorption property with increased thickness of the m-TiO2 layer  The absorption of the CH3NH3PbI3/m-TiO2 ( C2 ) /c-TiO2/FTO glass is highest  indicating that more perovskite was filled  In this sample  the thickness of the m-TiO2 has reached 680 nm  which is much thicker than that reported in most references  The perovskite can be well-filled into such thick m-TiO2 layer  which may be due to the warmed m-TiO2 layer and the stereoscopic uniform thermal heating during the fabrication process that make the perovskite deposit into the whole m-TiO2 layer more easily [ 20 ]  Observing from the figure and considering the carrier transport distance that could reach 600 nm as reported in literatures [ 30  31 ]  we choose the m-TiO2 layer with thickness of 680 nm for the following experiment  Fig  2 figure 2 UV-vis absorbance spectra of perovskite absorber layer deposited on m-TiO2 layer prepared from different concentration solution a 1:6 ( C6 )  b 1:4 ( C4 )  c 1:2 ( C2 ) Full size image 32 Preparation of perovskite absorber layer under infrared irradiation The preparation of perovskite absorber layer with near-infrared irradiation annealing has been explored previously [ 2223242526 ]  However  the infrared irradiation was just used as post annealing for the absorber layer and the fabrication process was still inside glove-box  Herein  we conducted the infrared irradiation during the fabrication process  The experiment result demonstrated that the air humidity could be decreased with the infrared irradiation  which could be due to the thermal effect of the infrared irradiation [ 32 ]  According to the humidometer  air humidity was 55 % without infrared irradiation and it could be down to 25 % with infrared irradiation  which may be due to the stereoscopic uniform thermal radiation from the infrared light  The air humidity could significantly impact the morphology of the prepared perovskite  Figure 3a and b display the surface morphology of the perovskite absorber layer prepared without and with infrared irradiation during the process  The result indicated that the perovskite thin film prepared without infrared irradiation was rough and leaky  While the perovskite thin film prepared with infrared irradiation presented compact and uniform  with grain size of CH3NH3PbI3 estimated to be 220 nm  Gao et al  thought that moisture had a negative effect on the nucleation of the perovskite at the spin coating stage  thus leading to less film coverage [ 33 ]  Thus  the perovskite thin film prepared under infrared irradiation with low humidity showed better coverage  Besides  prior to the deposition of the perovskite  the m-TiO2 layer was heated to a moderate temperature by the infrared irradiation and this also helped form the smooth and uniform perovskite [ 16  20 ]  The heated m-TiO2 layer together with the stereoscopic uniform thermal radiation from the infrared light make the precursor solution spontaneously to develop a perovskite absorber layer over the substrate during the deposition process  which is similar as an epitaxial growth by utilizing the kinetic energy of the hot substrate and it serves as foundation layer for the high quality absorber layer  Therefore  the infrared irradiation during the fabrication process could be very useful for the preparation of perovskite absorber layer in air ambience  Fig  3 figure 3 Surface morphologies of perovskite absorber layer prepared a without infrared irradiation  b with infrared irradiation Full size image The resistance of the perovskite absorber layer prepared without or with infrared irradiation was also measured  and the result is shown in Table 1  As we all know that low series resistance ( Rs  ideal value is around 10 Ω cm2 ) and high shunt resistance ( Rsh  ideal value is around 100 Ω cm2 ) are beneficial for charge extraction and transport  which are important to the PSC ’ s performance as reported in the literature [ 34 ]  In Table 1  the device with infrared irradiation exhibited lower Rs and Rsh compared to that without infrared irradiation  although the value still can be optimized in the future  The perovskite absorber layer prepared with infrared irradiation showed better electronic performance  which may be due to the effect of stereoscopic and uniform heating from the infrared irradiation  as discussed above  Thus  the infrared irradiation during the process was fixed for the fabrication of the following PSCs  Table 1 Electronic property of the perovskite absorber layer prepared without and with infrared irradiation Full size table The Pb and I element distribution of prepared perovskite absorber layer on the substrate of m-TiO2/c-TiO2/FTO glass with infrared irradiation are given in Fig  4  Figure 4a shows the measured field of the sample  According to Fig  4b  c  and d  the atom ratio of Pb and I was estimated to be 1:24  which is between 1:3 of the CH3NH3PbI3 and 1:2 of the PbI2  The result indicates that the PbI2 may partly remain within the prepared sample  Although the stoichiometric ratio of the prepared perovskite was not perfect  the distribution of the Pb  I  and Ti through the film was very uniform  demonstrating the perovskite was uniformly filled into the m-TiO2 layer  The infrared irradiation applied during the process not only can low the ambience moisture  but also can offer stereoscopic uniform thermal radiation to warm up the m-TiO2 layer  The warmed m-TiO2 layer together with the heat conducted from the FTO glass help get the uniform perovskite [ 20  22 ]  The uniform absorber layer is quite important since perovskite solar cells prepared by traditional methods often suffer from inadequate filling of perovskite at the bottom  which increases the recombination of carriers [ 35  36 ]  Fig  4 figure 4 a Cross-sectional SEM of Au/HTL/CH3NH3PbI3/m-TiO2/c-TiO2/FTO glass ( the red wire frame indicated the test region for the EDS ) and EDS mapping of b Pb  c I and d Ti of CH3NH3PbI3 prepared on substrate of m-TiO2/c-TiO2/FTO glass with infrared irradiation ( Color figure online ) Full size image The XRD was conducted to identify the crystal structure of the CH3NH3PbI3 prepared with the infrared irradiation during the process on the substrate of m-TiO2/c-TiO2/FTO glass  and the result is shown in Fig  5  From the figure  the characteristic peaks of the CH3NH3PbI3 appear at 141 °  245 °  284 °  318 °  336 °  404 °  and 430 °  originating from ( 110 )  ( 202 )  ( 220 )  ( 310 )  ( 312 )  ( 224 )  and ( 314 ) of the tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3  respectively [ 11  363738 ]  The infrared irradiation was considered to help remove the uncoordinated solvent molecules such as DMF rapidly during the fabrication process and thus help regulate the crystallization process of perovskite from the precursor solution  Empirical Scherrer formula has been used to calculate the crystallite size of CH3NH3PbI3 : D = kλ/ ( β cos θ )  where D is the crystallite size ( nm )  β is the full width at half-maximum height ( FWHM ) of ( 110 ) peak  θ is the corresponding Bragg diffraction angle ( ° )  λ is the wavelength of the X-ray radiation ( Cu Kα = 015406 nm )  and K is the Scherrer constant which is a function of the crystallite shape but can be generally taken as 10 [ 39 ]  It is shown that the crystallite size of the CH3NH3PbI3 was about 396 nm  which is similar as the reported data in the literature [ 40 ]  The XRD pattern proved that the CH3NH3PbI3 could be successfully prepared  However  a diffraction peak at 126° still can be observed  which is identified to be ( 001 ) of PbI2 ( JCPDS No  73-1750 ) often observed in air ambience prepared perovskite [ 19 ]  Therefore  to promote the performance of the fabricated perovskite absorber layer  its purity should be further improved in the future study  Fig  5 figure 5 XRD pattern of the perovskite absorber layer prepared with infrared irradiation Full size image 33 Property of the fabricated perovskite solar cell Figure 6 shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the fabricated full-structured solar cell ( Au/HTL/CH3NH3PbI3/m-TiO2/c-TiO2/FTO glass )  From the image  the perovskite was clearly fully filled into the m-TiO2 layer  and the total thickness of perovskite/m-TiO2 was estimated to be 740 nm  The prepared thin film was smooth and uniform  which could be benefited from the infrared irradiation by its stereoscopic and uniform heating as discussed in Sect  32  Furthermore  the perovskite/TiO2 is a three-dimensional structure with huge perovskite-TiO2 interface similar as reported in other literature [ 41 ]  which is very beneficial to the collection and transmission of the carriers [ 42  43 ]  Fig  6 figure 6 Cross-sectional SEM of the full-structured solar cell prepared with infrared irradiation ( Au/HTL/CH3NH3PbI3/m-TiO2/c-TiO2/FTO glass ) Full size image Figure 7 presents the J–V characteristic of the prepared device ( the inset shows its photo with instructions of active area in dotted lines and etching line for FTO bottom electrode )  The PCE of the prepared device is 873 % with short-circuit photocurrent density ( JSC ) of 2571 mA/cm2  open-circuit voltage ( VOC ) of 080 V and fill factor ( FF ) of 4245 %  The high JSC may be attributed to two factors  One is the uniform perovskite/TiO2 three-dimensional structure that was prepared under the infrared irradiation during the fabrication process  The other is the thickness of the prepared absorber layer that is higher to 740 nm  The thick and uniform three-dimensional perovskite/TiO2 structure can fully absorb the incoming sunlight  effectively separate the generated carriers and reduce carrier recombination [ 424344454647 ]  However  the FF of the prepared PSC is low  which may be due to the high Rs and Rsh as mentioned above  In this study  the PSC was prepared totally in air ambience  annealed at 50 °C  without the usage of high temperature or high intensity light post annealing process  And it shows JSC high to 2571 mA/cm2  which indicate that the proposed facile fabrication route could be efficient  According to the above analysis  the properties of the PSC can be further improved by promoting the phase purity and reducing the Rs and Rsh of the CH3NH3PbI3  Fig  7 figure 7 The J–V curve of the device prepared with infrared irradiation  The inset shows the photo of the prepared device Full size image 4 Conclusion Fabrication of the most classical CH3NH3PbI3-based PSC in air ambience condition is a big challenge  In this study  a facile and efficient fabrication route for PSC under infrared irradiation during fabrication process in air ambience was developed  The infrared irradiation was chosen to reduce the ambience moisture and to help prepare good quality perovskite absorber layer with decreased annealing temperature  which also avoided high intensity light annealing process  A 680 nm thick m-TiO2 layer from TiO2 slurry/ethanol concentration of 1:2 resulted into 740 nm perovskite/m-TiO2 layer with good optical absorption  Due to the stereoscopic uniform thermal radiation from the infrared light  the prepared perovskite absorber layer showed uniform  dense  smooth morphology with Rs of 2752 Ω cm2 and Rsh of 33109 Ω cm2  The prepared perovskite absorber layer also showed good crystallinity with crystallite size of 396 nm and uniform elements distribution through the whole thin film  The fabricated PSC showed JSC of 2571 mA/cm2  VOC of 800 mV  FF of 4245 % and PCE of 873 %  The high JSC may be attributed to the thick and uniform three-dimensional perovskite/TiO2 structure  which can fully absorb the incoming sunlight  effectively separate the generated carriers and reduce the carrier recombination  The result indicated the proposed facile fabrication route could be efficient  The main objective of the next work is to promote the phase purity of the CH3NH3PbI3  to reduce and control the Rs and Rsh of the CH3NH3PbI3 for improving the efficiency of the solar cell  The fabrication route without glove-box can be beneficial to industrial production of the PSCPerovskite light-emitting diodes ( PeLEDs ) have shown excellent performance in the green and near-infrared spectral regions  with high color purity  efficiency  and brightness  In order to shift the emission wavelength to the blue  compositional engineering ( anion mixing ) and quantum-confinement engineering ( reduced-dimensionality ) have been employed  Unfortunately  LED emission profiles shift with increasing driving voltages due to either phase separation or the coexistence of multiple crystal domains  Here we report color-stable sky-blue PeLEDs achieved by enhancing the phase monodispersity of quasi-2D perovskite thin films  We selected cation combinations that modulate the crystallization and layer thickness distribution of the domains  The perovskite films show a record photoluminescence quantum yield of 88 % at 477 nm  The corresponding PeLEDs exhibit stable sky-blue emission under high operation voltages  A maximum luminance of 2480 cd m−2 at 490 nm is achieved  fully one order of magnitude higher than the previous record for quasi-2D blue

devices with a diamine additive Article 18 March 2020 Introduction Metal halide perovskites are emerging as a promising candidate for solution-processed optoelectronics  including photovoltaics  photodetectors  lasers and light-emitting diodes ( LEDs ) 123456789101112131415161718  Thanks to their excellent properties such as a tunable bandgap  high photoluminescence quantum yield ( PLQY )  and high color purity  perovskite LEDs ( PeLEDs ) have attracted intense research interest  Recently  green- and near-infrared-emitting PeLEDs reached impressive external quantum efficiencies ( EQEs ) exceeding 10 % 4192021  However  producing color-stable and efficient blue PeLEDs required for lighting and displays remains challenging  especially in light of limited materials stabilty22232425  Conventional metal halide perovskites exhibit a three-dimensional ( 3D ) structure with a chemical formula of AMX3 ( A = CH3NH3 ( MA )  Cs ; M = Pb  Sn ; X = Cl  Br  I )  The bandgap of the mixed halide perovskites can be tuned monotonically by controlling the halogen component  One widely employed strategy to achieve blue PeLEDs ( emission wavelength between 450 and 490 nm ) is therefore to employ Cl : Br-mixed halide perovskites as the emissive material  However  the migration of the halogen ions enables phase segregation into Cl-rich and Br-rich phases under illumination and voltage bias242627  As a result  the electroluminescence ( EL ) wavelength undesirably shifts from blue to green during device operation  Quasi-two-dimensional ( quasi-2D ) perovskites provide another pathway to achieve blue PeLEDs  Their reduced-dimensional structure has a standard formula of B2An−1MnX3n+1  where B is a long-chain ligand such as butylammonium ( BA ) or phenylethylammonium ( PEA ) ( inset of Fig  1a )  By reducing the number of inorganic layers ( n )  one may tune the bandgap of quasi-2D perovskites from ca  26 eV ( n = 4 )  to 27 eV ( n = 3 )  29 eV ( n = 2 )  and 31 eV ( n = 1 ) ( Fig  1a ) 28  Quasi-2D blue PeLEDs have been also reported ; however  they exhibit poor color stability under LEDs operation2329303132  This is due to the presence of multiple emission peaks arising from mixed phases that exhibit inefficient charge transfer and different emission features dependent on bias voltage  Fig  1 figure 1 Bandgap and formation_energy calculations of quasi-2D perovskite  a Bandgap of quasi-2D perovskite with different number of layers  n These values are determined by TA measurement  The inset is the atomic model of the quasi-2D perovskite with n = 1  3  and 5 b Calculated formation_energy of PEABr  IPABr  and their mixed quasi-2D perovskites with different n value  The inset is an atomic model of the PEA/IPA mixed quasi-2D perovskite with n = 3 Full size image So far  PEA-based quasi-2D perovskites exhibited a well-defined single emission peak as a result of efficient charge transfer between quantum wells with various n values82833  However  PEA-based quasi-2D perovskites that use only Br could not reach blue emission due to the presence of the phase with large n2833  We postulate that the formation of different phases within a perovskite film could arise due to the imbalance of crystallization of different phases  Specifically  strong van der Waals interaction between the stacked bulky organic cations828 makes the formation of 2D perovskite with n = 1 most favorable ( Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig  1 )  This consumes a major portion of bulk organic cations and leaves the short-chain precursors ( those associated with the repeat unit of 3D crystals ) to nucleate phases with high n As a result  a mixed phase that includes high-n components shows green emission due to efficient carrier funneling to the smallest-bandgap phase  In this report  we therefore aim at slowing the formation of the pure n = 1 phase to improve the monodispersity of n = 2  3  4 phases enabling more controlled formation of a quasi-2D PEA2An−1PbnX3n+1 perovskite with a desired n We achieve this by replacing long ligands ( PEA ) with shorter ones ( iso-propylammonium  IPA )  an improvement that reduces van der Waals interactions  therefore destabilizing the n = 1 phase  Slower crystallization of n = 1 enhances purity and monodispersity of n = 2  3  and 4 phases  The as-synthesized perovskite films exhibit a single emission peak and color-stable blue emission ( 477 nm ) with a record PLQY of 88 %  The PL wavelength exhibits no shift under 325-nm irradiation ( 7 W cm−2 ) for 1 h We further fabricate sky-blue PeLEDs with a maximum luminance of 2480 cd m−2 at the wavelength of 490 nm  a luminance that is one order of magnitude higher than the previous record for quasi-2D blue PeLEDs ( Supplementary Table 1 ) 2329303132  Results Synthesis and structural analysis of perovskite films We synthesized blue emission perovskites by mixing PbBr2  MABr  CsBr  PEABr  and IPABr in the solution of dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) and using a one-step spin-coating method ( see Methods )  The mixture of MA and Cs cations has been shown previously to improve the crystallinity and stability of perovskite films34  The ratio of MABr/CsBr to PEABr and PbBr2 in the precursor solution was kept constant at 3:4:5  targeting an average perovskite formula PEA2A15Pb25Br85 ( A = MA and Cs )  We explored a number of additives to tune the emission properties : IPABr  ethylammonium bromide ( EABr )  n-propylammonium bromide ( PABr )  and butylammonium bromide ( BABr )  We found that only the addition of IPABr resulted in a perovskite product with high PLQY  Table 1 Summary of the composition of the perovskite samples and their corresponding PL peaks and PLQY Full size table Density functional theory ( DFT ) simulations ( Fig  1b ) show that when PEABr and IPABr ligands are used in combination  the formation_energy of the 2D perovskite with n = 1 changes from −72 ( more stable ) to −65 eV ( less stable )  indicating a partial destabilization of n = 1 phase compared to the n = 2  3  and 4 phases  Due to stoichiometry constraints  we obtained only quasi-2D perovskites with low number of inorganic layers  which is critical to achieving blue emission  X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) results reveal the layered structure of formed perovskite thin films ( Supplementary Fig  2 )  Diffraction peaks at 435  874  135  272  and 3155 degrees correspond to the ( 0 0 l ) series of Bragg reflections of the quasi-2D perovskite  The lowest angle of 435° corresponds to the lattice fringe of 20 nm  which we assign to the interlayer spacing in the quasi-2D perovskite phase with n = 235  Optical properties of perovskite films Figure 2a shows PL spectra of the perovskite films  Pristine PEA2A15Pb25Br85 perovskite emits at 504 nm ; the addition of IPABr progressively shifts the PL peak from 497 to 467 nm as the IPABr/Pb ratio increases from 10 to 60 %  The corresponding photograph of the perovskite films under UV light is shown in the inset of Fig  2a  The highest PLQY of 73 % was obtained with an IPABr ratio of 40 % ( Table 1 )  By tuning the fractions of MABr and CsBr  we further optimized the PLQY and obtained a highest value of 88 % with the PL peak at 477 nm  Fig  2 figure 2 Photophysical properties of quasi-2D perovskite  a PL and b absorption spectra of perovskite PEA2A15Pb25Br85 with 0−60 %

were used to characterize the optical bandgap and excitonic features of these perovskites  In Fig  2b  multiple excitonic absorption features at 31  29  27  and 26 eV correspond to the perovskite phases with n = 1  2  3  and 4  respectively28  We also observed a blueshift of the absorption edge of the perovskite films with increased IPABr fraction  We attribute this blueshift to the fact that the component of lowest-n and highest-n phases was inhibited gradually  while the intermediate n phase ( n = 2  3  4 ) grew faster instead ( Fig  2b )  Transient absorption spectroscopy To gain further insights into the dynamics of photocarriers in the bright blue quasi-2D perovskites  we carried out transient absorption ( TA ) studies ( Fig  2c )  In the control sample ( without IPABr )  we observed five distinct bleach peaks at 405  435  465  483  and 495 nm  The peak locations of these transitions are in good agreement with peaks in the steady-state absorption spectra ( Fig  2b )  These results show that the quasi-2D perovskite PEA2A15Pb25Br85 films are not single-phase  but instead consist of a mixture of phases with n = 1  2  3  4  5  and higher28  The band edge energies of the perovskites with n ≥ 5 are closely spaced and difficult to distinguish  Therefore  we propose that bulk perovskite phases with larger n values may also exist in the PEA2A15Pb25Br85 films  In contrast  in the sample with 40 % IPABr additive  only four distinctive phases with n = 1  2  3  and 4 were observed with no spectral or XRD features that are normally attributed to n ≥ 5  We then investigated the decay kinetics of multi-exciton bleaching ( Fig  2d )  We extracted three distinct kinetics at 432  455  and 476 nm corresponding to n = 2  3  and 4  that revealed the following time constants after fitting ( Fig  2e ) : 13 ± 01 ps and 06 ± 001 ps ( 432 nm ) ; 420 ± 10 ps and 64 ± 2 ps ( 455 nm ) ; and 4 ± 1 ns and 10 ± 01 ns ( 476 nm ) In light of previous reports of very fast charge transfer among perovskite phases36  we assign the fast component at 432  455 nm ( n = 2  3 ) to the charge transfer to perovskite with n = 4 and ascribe the slow component to charge trapping28  We attribute the fast and the slow features at 476 nm ( emitting domain  n = 4 ) to a nonradiative and a radiative process  respectively  Notably  at 476 nm  the timescale of the rise of the bleach intensity ∆T/T ( during the first 100 ps ) is in good agreement with the charge transfer ( reflected by lifetime decay ) that was previously reported for a perovskite phase with n = 336  We further studied the color stability of these improved quasi-2D perovskites  The PL spectra of the PEA2A15Pb25Br85 perovskite with 40 % IPABr under continuous 325 nm laser radiation ( 7 W cm−2 ) are shown in Fig  2f  The PL maximum is unchanged even after irradiation for 60 min  In contrast  the PL peak of a mixed halide perovskite MAPbBr15Cl15 film shifts from 460 to 515 nm within 10 min of illumination under the same conditions ( Fig  2g )  Device structure and performance Encouraged by the above results  we further fabricated PeLEDs using perovskite films with highest PLQYs ( Sample V  see Methods for details )  As indicated in Fig  3a  b  we began with the following PeLED architecture : ITO/PEDOT : PSS ( 30 nm ) /perovskite film ( 40–125 nm ) /TPBi ( 50 nm ) /LiF ( 1 nm ) /Al ( 100 nm )  We measured the energy levels of the perovskites by using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy ( UPS  Supplementary Fig  3 )  As shown in the atomic force microscopy ( AFM  Fig  3d ) image  the surface roughness of the perovskite film on PEDOT : PSS is only 1 nm  which is sufficiently small to avoid current leakage  Fig  3 figure 3 Device structure of PeLEDs  a Device structure  b cross-sectional SEM image and c energy level alignment of the PeLEDs  showing conduction and valence-band levels with respect to vacuum  The energy level of perovskite layer was determined by UPS measurement  d AFM image of perovskite film on PEDOT : PSS  Scan area is 5 × 5 μm2  The surface roughness was measured to be around 10 nm Full size image Compared to 3D perovskites  quasi-2D perovskites exhibit lower conductivity and thus their LED architecture usually requires thinner active layers  To explore the effect of the thickness on our device performance  we studied the PeLEDs with thicknesses of the active layer ranging from 125 nm ( Device I ) to 80 nm ( Device II )  60 nm ( Device III )  and 40 nm ( Device IV ) ( Supplementary Fig  4 )  We found that devices with thinner active layers showed both increased current density and luminance ( Fig  4a )  We also found that higher brightness ( 2480 cd m−2  Device IV  Fig  4b ) was achieved through a systematic reduction of thickness  The best EQEs  power efficiency  and current efficiency of 15 %  092 lm W−1  and 28 cd A−1  respectively  were found in Device II ( Fig  4c−e )  We propose that a higher EQE can be achieved through improvement of the electron ( ETLs ) and hole ( HTLs ) transport layers to optimize the charge carrier injection and blocking functions  As indicated in Fig  4b  c  the maximum luminance and the maximum EQE were obtained from different devices  Luminance ( L ) is proportional to the product of current density ( J ) and efficiency ( EQE )  indicating that luminance is affected by both current density and efficiency  While thinner perovskite films achieve higher J  they do not always have higher EQE  EQE is governed by exciton and charge carrier dynamics  Most exciton quenching processes scale with charge carrier concentrations  making quenching processes most pronounced at high current densities  The reduction of perovskite thickness also increases the chance of charge carrier leakage  More exciton quenching and more charge carrier leakage will result in lower EQE  Therefore  increasing the maximum current density can compensate for some of these EQE losses ; however  the best luminance could still be realized in a device with higher maximum current density  To characterize the reproducibility of the PeLED  we summarized the sample results such as maximum luminance  EQE  and current efficiency of Devices IV with record luminance  Figure 4f−h shows an average luminance of 1758 cd m−2 with a relative standard deviation of 22 %  an average EQE of 10 % with a relative standard

color stability of the PeLEDs was tested during the device operation  As bias voltage increased from 5 to 10 V  the EL intensity increased correspondingly  and the EL peak of 490 nm and full-width at half-maximum ( FWHM ) of 28 nm remained stable ( Fig  5a )  When we further gradually increased bias voltage up 13 V  the EL intensity decreased accordingly mainly due to the degradation of the perovskite materials ( Supplementary Fig  5 )  yet both the EL peak position and FWHM remained unchanged  The EL spectra of the PeLEDs also changed negligibly under continuous operation for 35 min ( Fig  5b )  The stability of PeLEDs is still a big challenge  especially for blue PeLEDs  which work under higher driving voltage compared to green and red PeLEDs  The sky-blue PeLEDs lifetimes were measured to be 10  4  and 05 min at initial luminance of 10  20  and 210 cd m−2  respectively ( Fig  5c )  This is consistent with the empirical scaling law  where L0 is initial luminance  T1/2 is LEDs half-lifetime  n is a scaling factor and C is a constant  This equation implies that higher initial luminance will result in lower lifetime  Fig  5 figure 5 EL spectra of PeLEDs  a EL spectra of

fabricated LEDs based on perovskite samples I  II  III  IV  and VII with the thickness of 40 nm  The current densities of these devices decreased as the fraction of IPABr increased ; meanwhile  their maximum luminance decreased from ca  33000 ( Sample I device ) to 32500 ( Sample II device )  21000 ( Sample III device )  1700 ( Sample IV device ) and 2 cd m−2 ( Sample VII device ) accordingly ( Supplementary Fig  6 )  This may be due to the fact that low conductive ligands blocking charge injection  The maximum EQE of Sample I and II devices are similar ( ca  26 % )  and this value increases to 40 % in Sample III device  and then decrease to 22 % in Sample IV device and further to 005 % in Sample VII device  This is consistent with the trend of PLQY  The EL signal of these devices gradually blue shifted from 513 to 474 nm as the fraction of IPABr increased from 0 to 60 %  The EL peaks also red shifted compared to their corresponding PL peaks  The EL redshift of PEDOT : PSS-based PeLEDs may be induced by the ionic nature of PEDOT : PSS  We also therefore explored devices with neutral HTLs PVK and NiOx  Using PVK and NiOx improved hole injection  which can be explained by their lower HOMO level compared to that of PEDOT : PSS ( Fig  3c )  The threshold to achieve 1 cd m−2 decreased from 62 V ( PEDOT : PSS ) to 38 V ( PVK ) and 47 V ( NiOx ) ( Supplementary Fig  7 )  Their corresponding EL spectra are consistent with the PL spectra of the perovskite film on glass substrate  located at 481 nm ( PVK ) and 477 nm ( NiOx ) ( Fig  5d )  These enable CIE 1931 chromatic coordinates ( 0098  0174 ) and ( 0107  0137 ) for purer-blue devices ( Fig  5e )  Figure 5f shows the photographs of operating PeLEDs with PEDOT : PSS  PVK and NiOx as the HTL material  respectively  Emission color stability was also monitored during device operation  Even though the operating voltage was increased to 85 V  the EL intensity increased with the EL peak positions and FWHM remaining stable ( Supplementary Fig  8 )  To identify the influence of different HTLs on the structure of the perovskite films  we first studied the PL spectra of the perovskite films fabricated on glass  NiOx  PVK  and PEDOT : PSS substrates  respectively  The PL peaks of the perovskite films on glass and NiOx are all located at 477 nm ; for PVK substrate  the PL peak slightly redshifts to 478 nm ; however  the PL peak redshifts to 488 nm for PEDOT : PSS substrate ( Supplementary Fig  9 )  UV−Vis absorption and TA spectra were used to characterize the bandgap and excitonic feature of these perovskite films ( Supplementary Fig  9 )  We also observed a redshift by 10 nm of the absorption edge of the perovskite film on PEDOT : PSS substrate  In TA spectra  three distinct bleach peaks were observed from perovskite films on glass  NiOx  and PVK substrates  which correspond to the perovskite phases with n = 2  3  and 4  In contrast  in the perovskite film on PEDOT : PSS substrate  the perovskite phase with n > 4 appears  as evidenced from one additional feature around 480–490 nm  Therefore  the EL redshift of the LED device with PEDOT : PSS as HTL is attributed to the perovskite phase with large n induced by PEDOT : PSS layer  Discussion In this study we report the synthesis of color-stable blue-emitting perovskite thin film with high PLQYs  Our approach was to deliberately select cation combinations to modulate the crystallization of quasi-2D perovskites  When IPA and PEA ligands were used simultaneously  the growth of lowest-n and highest-n phases was inhibited  allowing the growth of intermediate-n phases to dominate instead  The resultant films display highly efficient PL and stable blue emission  Efficient and color-stable sky-blue PeLEDs have been made from these perovskite films and the devices show record high bright luminance and high EQE  Methods Materials and chemicals All alkylamine bromides were purchased from Dyesol  Cesium bromide

prepared by dissolving certain quantities of PbBr2  CsBr  MABr  PEABr  and IPABr in DMSO under continuous stirring for 2 h at room temperature  The resulting solution was spin-coated onto the substrate via a one-step process 5000 rpm  for 60 s During the spin step  200 μL of toluene were poured onto the substrate  The resulting films were then annealed at 70 °C for 10 min to remove the residual solvent  The thickness of the perovskite film was tuned by using the precursor solution with different Pb concentrations 05  03  02  and 015 M Their corresponding thicknesses are around 125  80  60  and 40 nm  respectively  Perovskite film characterizations The structure of as-grown samples was characterized by using Panalytical X ’ Pert Pro diffractometer  UV−Vis absorption was measured

Horiba Fluorolog system equipped with a single grating and a monochromatized Xe lamp was used as the excitation source  PLQY measurements were done by coupling a Quanta-Phi integrating sphere to the Horiba Fluorolog system with optical fiber bundles  Both excitation and emission spectra were collected for the two cases of the sample directly illuminated by the excitation beam path in the integrating sphere and the empty sphere itself  The monochromatized Xe lamp was used as excitation source with wavelength of 400 nm and power of 1 mW cm−2  PL stability was measured on HR800 Raman spectrograph and 325 nm laser was used as excitation source  Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy The 800 nm output pulse laser ( 1 KHz repetition rate  100 fs pulse width ) from a commercial Ti : Sapphire regenerative amplifier ( Spectra-Physics Spitfire ) is split into two paths  One beam goes through a mechanical delay stage to pump a sapphire/CaF2 crystal to generate a light continuum to serve as the probe pulse  The second beam is sent to an optical parametric amplifier ( Spectra-Physics TOPAS ) to generate pump pulses ( 380 nm  28 μW )  The pump and probe pulses with a cross-polarization configuration are collinearly focused on samples with a beam size of 100 and 50 μm  respectively  by using parabolic mirrors  A mechanical chopper with a synchronized readout of a CMOS detector is used for acquisitions of probe spectra with and without pump-induced changes  enabling calculation of a relative differential transmission  The spectra resolution is 1~2 nm across the detecting range  First-principle calculations We used ground state DFT with the Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof ( PBE ) 37 GGA exchange correlation functional as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package ( VASP ) 38 to perform structural optimization of the perovskites  All calculations allowed for spin polarization  We used plane wave energy cut-off of 450 eV and Gaussian smearing ( 02 eV ) to converge the electronic problem  The Monkhorst-Pack k-points mesh of 900 per atom and the force convergence criterion of 00005 eV per atom × N atoms in the unit cell were used as implemented in the MPRelaxSet class of the Pymatgen Python package394042  The formation_energy of the perovskites was calculated according to the following formula : PeLEDs fabrication Thin films of PEDOT : PSS  PVK  and NiOx were prepared using spin-coating of the precursor solution onto the prewashed patterned ITO-glass substrates  PEDOT : PSS ( Clevios PVP AI 4083 ) solution was spin-coated in air at 4000 rpm  for 60 s followed by annealing process in air at 150 °C for 30 min  For the deposition of NiOx layer  05 M nickel formate dihydrate ethylene glycol solution containing 1 molar equivalents of ethylenediamine was filtered with 045 μm nylon filter and spin-coated at 4000 rpm  for 90 s followed by annealing process at 300 °C in air for 60 min  After the substrates were cooled down to room temperature  O2 plasma was used to treat the NiOx films at a power of 50 W for 5 min  Substrates were then used for device fabrication immediately  For the deposition of PVK layer  PVK/chlorobenzene ( 5 mg mL−1 ) solution was spin-coated on the ITO-glass substrate at 3000 rpm  for 60 s  and annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in a nitrogen-filled glovebox  Perovskite precursor solutions were spin-coated on the PEDOT : PSS film as described above  TPBi ( 50 nm ) and LiF/Al electrodes ( 1 nm/100 nm ) were deposited using a thermal evaporation system through a shadow mask under a high vacuum of less than 10−4 Pa  The device active area was 64 mm2 as defined by the overlapping area of the ITO and Al electrodes  PeLEDs characterizations The luminance−current density−voltage characteristics were collected by using a HP4140B picoammeter  The absolute EL power spectra of the devices were collected using an integrating sphere and an Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrometer by the mounting of the devices on the wall of the integrating sphere  The EQEs were then calculated through the measured absolute power spectra and the current density  The lifetime of LEDs was measured at constant current density  In total  about 200 PeLEDs were fabricated and tested in this workAbstract Materials with perovskite-type crystal structure attract much attention due to their unique optical properties  such as high quantum yield of photoluminescence and high carrier mobility  However  their further utilization as an active media in photonic and optoelectronic devices is limited by the lack of stability of their optical responses together with the presence of lead cations in the chemical composition  Here  a detailed study of the optical properties and their stability under ambient conditions of perovskite films with the chemical composition ( CH3NH3 ) xAyIz  where A = Pb  Bi  Sb  was performed  The changes in optical responses of the samples were monitored for 3 months  It was shown that the stability of perovskite films was improved by surface passivation with a thin layer of polymethylmethacrylate onto their surface  The developed procedures of film formation and following surface passivation are of interest in the design of active optical materials based on perovskite films with the increased optical performanceThis manuscript describes the synthesis of formamidinium lead iodide ( FAPbI3 ) thin films annealed at different temperatures to investigate the perovskite phase formation temperature and check its effect on morphology and optical properties  By using these materials  inverted perovskite solar cells devices were also fabricated for the photovoltaic properties  Devices with FAPbI3 annealed at 130 °C and higher temperature have shown power conversion

the best PCE of 1499 % was observed with x = 01  Films were characterized by XRD  UV–vis absorption spectroscopy  photoluminescence  SEM and AFM  Introduction Hybrid organo-inorganic perovskites ( HOIP ) have been extensively investigated due to its marvelous properties  especially  as a light-harvesting material in third-generation solar cells [ 123 ]  Perovskite-based solar cells have attained a record efficiency over 23 %  which is attributed to its high absorption capability along with its long charge carrier diffusion lengths [ 4  5 ]  In comparison with silicon-based solar cells  perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) have a much lower expected production cost because of the easy processing techniques  ie  solution process  hence  shorter energy payback time [ 3  6 ]  Although  perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) have achieved a very high efficiency  the stability of these devices is the basic hindrance in its commercialization  Humidity  heat and light affect the perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) by decomposing methyl ammonium lead iodide ( CH3NH3PbI3 ) and formamidinium lead iodide ( HC ( NH2 ) 2PbI3 ) [ 78910 ]  For the long-term stability of PSCs  perovskite material should be stabilized against the humidity  Different approaches have been employed to overcome this instability  which includes the encapsulation techniques [ 10  11 ]  modifications of the perovskite material itself [ 12131415 ] and passivating layers [ 161718 ]  We can modify the cation as well as anion in perovskite material  By the replacement of iodide with bromide  a high band gap material methyl ammonium lead bromide ( MAPbBr3 ) was synthesized which has shown no degradation under intense sunlight and humid atmosphere [ 19  20 ]  This improved stability arises due to the higher electronegativity of bromide ions in comparison to iodide ion that results in a stronger hydrogen bonding interaction among the organic cation and the halide framework [ 21 ]  Due to the identical miscibility of halides  the mixed anion perovskite MAPb ( I1-xBrx ) 3 has provided more stability along with reasonable efficiencies in solar cell devices [ 12  20 ]  Moreover  the formation of non-perovskite phase can be suppressed by mixing FAPbI3 and MAPbBr3  which has shown a significant increase in the solar cell performance even at low fractions of MAPbBr3  This improved performance can be attributed to the optimization of the size ratios of the different components in the perovskite phase [ 22  23 ]  Goldschmidt tolerance_factor t ( Eq  1 ) can be used to quantify the size ratio for perovskite materials with composition ABX3 ( where A = organic cation ; M = metal cation ; X = halide anion )  with rA  rM  and rX being the corresponding ionic radii [ 24 ] : ( 1 ) The tolerance_factor t describes the stability of perovskite phase  it is most stable for t in the range of 08 < t < 1 and unstable for values greater than 1 and less than 08  The calculated tolerance_factor for FAPbI3 ( t > 1 ) and CsPbI3 ( t < 08 ) suggests that a perovskite structure is unstable at room temperature which has been verified experimentally [ 24  25 ]  Beside the more advanced methods that consider a changing covalent character [ 26 ]  Goldschmidt tolerance ( t ) concept interprets effectively for the Pb-based organo-metal halide perovskites [ 24 ]  Recently  the perovskite with mixed cations containg alkali metals such as potassium [ 27  28 ]  rubidium [ 29 ] and cesium Cs has been reported as stabilized perovskite phase at room temperature along with reduction in moisture sensitivity [ 14  25  30 ]  this improved stability describes the impact of compositional engineering on the stability of the perovskite material  For tandem solar cells  the desired absorption properties can be achieved by the mixed perovskites [ 31 ]  Mixtures of methylammonium  formamidinium  iodide and bromide have shown very promising photovoltaic properties [ 22  32 ]  In this work  we are presenting the effect of annealing temperature on formamidinium lead iodide ( FAPbI3 ) perovskite phase formation  The results of methylammonium lead bromide ( MAPbBr3 ) in formamidinium lead iodide ( FAPbI3 ) in different ratios have also been investigated  We have also fabricated the solar cell devices by using these compositions of perovskite materials  2 Experimental section 21 Materials Indium tin oxide ( ITO ) glass substrates ( sheet resistance 15 Ω/□ ) were obtained from the NSG group  Formamidinium iodide ( FAI ) and methylammonium bromide ( MABr ) were supplied by GreatCell Solar  Other chemicals such as lead ( II ) bromide ( PbBr2  99999 % purity )  lead ( II ) iodide ( PbI2 beads  99999 % purity )  fullerene C60 ( 98 % purity )  chlorobenzene ( anhydrous  998 % purity )  toluene ( anhydrous  995 % purity )  dimethylformamide ( DMF  ≥ 99 % purity )  dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO  anhydrous  ≥ 999 % purity )  isopropyl alcohol ( IPA  anhydrous 995 % purity ) and silver ( Ag beads  ≥ 9999 % purity ) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich  All the materials and chemicals were used as received without further purification  22 Preparation of PTAA and perovskite precursor solution The poly-triaryl amine ( PTAA ) precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 2 mg PTAA in 1 ml toluene  The perovskite precursor solutions were prepared in two steps  in the first step 1 M FAPbI3 solution and 1 M MAPbBr3 solution in DMF/DMSO ( 4:1 vol  ratio ) were prepared  while  in the second step  1 M FAPbI3 and 1 M MAPbBr3 solutions were mixed in different volume ratios  23 Fabrication and testing of PSCs The devices with architecture shown in Fig  1 were fabricated using the following process  Indium tin oxide ( ITO ) glass substrates were cleaned by sonication successively in detergent  deionized water  acetone and isopropanol  The sonication time was 15 min for each cleaning step  They were dried with N2 gas flow then transferred into a glove box filled with N2 gas to coat PTAA and perovskite layer  The PTAA layer was deposited on ITO by spin coating by dripping its precursor solution at 6000 rpm for 20 s followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min  The perovskite layer was optimized in two phases  initially by annealing the FAPbI3 at 100 °C  110 °C  120 °C  130 °C  140 °C and 150 °C and latterly by mixing MAPbBr3 and FAPbI3 in different ratios and annealed at 100 °C  The perovskite layer was coated by dripping 75 µL perovskite precursor solution and spin coated in two steps first at 2000 rpm for 10 s and then at 6000 rpm for 20 s 150 µL of chlorobenzene was dripped 5 s before the end of spin coating process followed by annealing at corresponding temperature as stated earlier for 20 min  The perovskite films ’ thickness was around 300 nm  The devices were completed by sequential thermal depositions of C60 ( 45 nm thick ) and Ag ( 100 nm thick ) in a vacuum of ~ 1 × 10–6 Torr in a thermal evaporator  The gold-coated quartz crystal microbalance thickness monitor was used to control the thickness of the films  Prior to deposition  a calibration of thickness monitor was done by depositing thicker films on glass and calibrated by surface profiler  To prevent the devices from moisture effect  encapsulation of devices with UV-curable epoxy and glass sheets was done in the glove box before photovoltaic testing  The active area of each device was 011 cm2  Fig  1 figure 1 FAPbI3 films deposited on glass substrate annealed at various temperatures Full size image 24 Characterization of materials The atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) images were acquired with a Veeco NanoScope IV Multi-Mode AFM in the tapping mode and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) images with a Zeiss Supra-40 SEM  The absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer  The photoluminescence ( PL ) spectra were obtained using a Horiba Scientific Raman system  The devices were tested under ambient conditions  The current density ( J ) –voltage ( V ) curves were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source meter  A Newport ’ s Oriel class A solar simulator  which was calibrated by a standard Si photodiode detector  was used to simulate the AM15 sunlight ( 100 mW cm−2 )  3 Results and discussion 31 Annealing studies of formamidinium lead iodide ( FAPbI3 ) Formamidinium lead iodide ( FAPbI3 ) thin films post-annealed at various temperatures  ie  100 °C  110 °C  120 °C  130 °C  140 °C and 150 °C are shown in Fig  1  The films annealed up to 120 °C have shown non-perovskite yellow phase  while the films post-annealed at higher temperature have shown black phase which is the indication of the formation of perovskite phase as reported by Binek etal  they suggested that the yellow color is due to the γ-phase  while the black color is an indication of -phase of FAPbI3 [ 33 ]  For the confirmation of phase formation in these films  X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) spectra were obtained  XRD patterns of the samples are shown in Fig  2  XRD pattern shows that the samples annealed at 100 °C  110 °C and 120 °C have their characteristic peak at 2θ = 12006 which corresponds to the hexagonal phase of FAPbI3 and the sample annealed at 130 °C has three characteristic peaks at 12006  1295 and 1419  which correspond to FAPbI3 hexagonal phase  lead iodide and perovskite phase  respectively  With annealing at higher temperatures  ie  150 °C  only the perovskite phase is present  which indicates the formation of perovskite phase completely  This formation of perovskite phase at higher annealing temperature is in complete agreement with the already reported results by Zhang et  al  [ 34 ]  They have shown that the perovskite -phase of FAPbI3 is formed above 130 °C  The formation of perovskite phase is further verified by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy  The absorption spectra of films are shown in Fig  3  Spectra shows that samples annealed at 100 °C and 110 °C do not have an absorption edge in visible range  but the sample annealed at 120 °C has  however  shown very little absorption in visible range which is due to the non-perovskite phase of FAPbI3  The samples annealed at higher temperatures have shown a significant absorption in visible range with absorption edge lying at 820 nm which corresponds to the energy band gap of 151 eV which is in good agreement with the already reported band gap of FAPbI3  ie  150 eV by Zhang etal [ 34 ]  Band gap of FAPbI3 with perovskite phase is optimum for harvesting the solar spectrum  Fig  2 figure 2 XRD spectra of FAPbI3 films deposited on glass substrate annealed at temperatures 100 °C  110 °C  120 °C  130 °C  140 °C and 150 °C Full size image Fig  3 figure 3 UV–vis absorption spectroscopy of FAPbI3 films deposited on glass substrate annealed at temperatures 100 °C  110 °C  120 °C  130 °C  140 °C and 150 °C Full size image We demonstrated the perovskite solar cells using the FAPbI3 annealed at different temperatures as the absorber layer  The device structure of the perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) and current density ( J ) –voltage ( V ) curves of these devices is shown in Fig  4  From the J–V characteristics  it is obvious that device with FAPbI3 annealed at 100 °C and 110 °C has shown almost zero power conversion efficiency ( PCE )  while the device with FAPbI3 ( 120 °C ) has shown a very small PCE of 118 %  The devices with FAPbI3 annealed at higher temperature  as the absorber layer  have shown PCE more than 10 %  The underlying reason for this remarkable increase in PCE is the formation of perovskite phase of FAPbI3 at 130 °C and higher annealing temperatures as confirmed by the appearance and results of XRD and absorption spectroscopy  To understand the effect of annealing temperature on device performance  series resistance ( Rs ) and shunt resistance ( RSH ) are calculated fromJ–V curves by employing single diode model as explained in the previously reported study [ 33 ]  These results have shown that devices with FAPbI3 annealed at lower temperature have very large series resistance and shunt resistance due to the non-perovskite phase  After the formation of perovskite phase  the series resistance has decreased  while shunt resistance has increased with the increase in annealing temperature  Due to this decrease in Rs and increase in RSH  the performance of the devices is enhanced  Performance parameters of devices are listed in Table 1  Fig  4 figure 4 a Device architecture and bJ–V curves of ITO/PTAA/FAPbI3/C60/Ag champion devices under AM15

Performance enhancement with mixed perovskites  formamidinium–methylammonium lead iodide bromide ( FAPbI3 ) 1-x ( MAPbBr3 ) x  [ x = 0  005  01  015  02  1 ] Formamidinium lead iodide FAPbI3 perovskite phase formation requires a higher annealing temperature  as discussed in the previous section  because it contains a large cation formamidinium ( FA+ )  Due to this large cation  structure strains arise in the unit cells which cause higher surface roughness and hence affect the device performance  Mixing of cations and anions in various ratios ( large and small size ) would lead to the relaxation of sub-lattices  We have mixed formamidinium lead iodide ( FAPbI3 ) and methyl ammonium lead bromide ( MAPbBr3 ) in different ratios and investigated their influence on device performance  Results are presented in this section  The device structure with mixed perovskite material as potential absorber is shown in Fig  5a  In these inverted devices  we used PTAA as the hole transport layer and fullerene C60 as the passivating/electron collection layer  The J–V characteristics of best performing device are shown in Fig  5b  Device parameters  such as short circuit current density ( Jsc )  open circuit voltage ( Voc )  fill factor ( FF )  power conversion efficiency ( PCE )  series resistance ( Rs ) and shunt resistance ( RSH ) of all the devices are presented in Table 2  From Table 2  we can see that devices fabricated from FAPbI3 with addition of 10 % MAPbBr3 has enhanced performance  The further increase in MAPbBr3 ratio suppresses PCE  The devices with only MAPbBr3 have shown PCE of the order of 54 %  Short circuit current density Jsc have shown first an increase and then decrease with increase in the ratio of MAPbBr3  Open circuit voltage ( Voc ) is linked to the band gap of the absorber layer  The open circuit voltage of the devices improved with increase in MAPbBr3 amount which is due to the increase in the band gap of the composite perovskite material  Moreover  the device with ( FAPbI3 ) 09 ( MAPbBr3 ) 01 has shown the highest FF of 067 and PCE of 1499 % in our devices  A similar trend for the solar cell devices has been reported by Yang et al  varying the ratios of FA+/MA+ they selected with 04:06 having the best performance  and they also varied the ratios of anion I−/Br− to improve the efficiency  Amongst  these devices having 10 % Br− showed the best performance [ 32 ]  Our devices have shown the same trends for their performance as far as their cations and anion ratios are concerned  Fig  5 figure 5 a Device architecture and b JV

MAPbBr3 ) x/C60/Ag devices with x = 0  005  01  015  02 and 1 Full size table To check the effect of addition of methyl ammonium lead bromide ( MAPbBr3 ) in formamidinium lead iodide ( FAPbI3 )  the XRD spectra of the samples were taken which are shown in Fig  6  XRD spectra show that the sample with addition of 5 % MAPbBr3 showed a dominating hexagonal phase  and a small peak of perovskite phase is also present  Samples with 10 % and higher amount of MAPbBr3 additions followed by annealing of film at 100 °C have shown the only perovskite peak indicating the complete formation of perovskite phase  Moreover  the XRD spectra were resolved for 2θ = 10–20 values to check the effect of MAPbBr3 addition with FAPbI3  Figure 6b shows that there is a shift in perovskite peak towards larger 2θ values  which is the indication of shrinkage of unit cell due to the smaller cation and halide part of perovskite material  This shifting of perovskite phase peak is similar to the already reported data by Ruess etal  These authors have shown that the shift of characteristic peak towards larger 2θ values with increasing amount of MAPbBr3 in FAPbI3 is due to the smaller sizes of the cations and anions of MAPbBr3 [ 36 ]  These results suggested that the complete perovskite phase is formed at 100 °C with the addition of only10 % MAPbBr3 in FAPbI3 with highest PCE  Fig  6 figure 6 XRD spectra

spectroscopy to check the effect of addition of MAPbBr3 in FAPbI3 on the absorption edge in visible range  the absorption spectra of the samples are shown in Fig  7  These spectra show that the absorption edge shifted towards a shorter wavelength  which is due to the widening of the band gap of the perovskite material  Ruess etal have prepared the layers of ( FAPbI3 ) 1−x ( MAPbBr3 ) x with x = 0  015  03  05  07 and 1 on glass substrates and have shown a shift in absorption edge towards shorter wavelengths of perovskite material when increasing the MAPbBr3/FAPbI3 ratios [ 36 ]  The J–V results have shown that the optimum FAPbI3 to MAPbBr3 ratio is 9:1  With a larger amount of MAPbBr3 addition  suppression in the PCE has been observed  The underlying reason for this suppression is the increase in the band gap of the final compound  The enhancement of band gap results in the suppression of Jsc and FF of the devices  Shifting of absorption edge was also verified by photoluminescence spectroscopy  PL spectra are shown in Fig  8  These results are consistent with absorption spectroscopy and XRD results  Fig  7 figure 7 UV–vis absorption spectra of formamidinium

MAPbBr3  the surface roughness suppresses from root mean square value ( RMS ) = 49 nm to 233 nm for sample with x = 01  with further increase in MAPbBr3  the roughness increases again  Larger roughness induces more trap centers of the carriers which in term reduces the performance of the device  Fig  9 figure 9figure 9 AFM and SEM micrographs of formamidinium lead iodide FAPbI3 ( 150 °C )

iodide ( FAPbI3 ) thin films annealed at temperatures 100 °C  110 °C  120 °C  130 °C  140 °C and 150 °C to study the onset temperature of perovskite phase formation and study its effect on the morphology and optical properties of the films  XRD results have shown that samples annealed at 130 °C and above have demonstrated a strong peak of perovskite phase  With the increase in annealing temperature  the absorption edge shifts from UV region to visible region at 820 nm ( Eg = 151 eV )  PSCs with formamidinium lead iodide ( FAPbI3 ) annealed at 130 °C and above have shown PCE well in excess of 11 %  We have also demonstrated PSCs with formamidinium –methylammonium lead iodide bromide ( FAPbI3 ) 1−x ( MAPbBr3 ) x ( x = 0  005  01  015  02 and 1 ) as the absorbing layer and the best PCE of 1499 % was achieved for x = 01  For these mixed perovskites  XRD results have shown a shift in the characteristic peak toward higher 2θ  The shift in the absorption edge towards a shorter wavelength is due to the increase of band gap of the material which is also confirmed by PL results  SEM and AFM have shown an improved film quality by decrease in film roughness  A small addition of MAPbBr3 in FAPbI3 helps to improve the film quality and stability along with improved photovoltaic performance  Referencesbstract Perovskite solar cells ( PSC ) have shown extraordinary progress over the last few years with remarkable efficiency  The perovskite film quality and structure can affect the performance of the resulting devices  Herein  the effect of PCDTBT addition on perovskite MAPbI3-xClx precursor solutions on the photovoltaic properties was investigated  It was found that the addition of the PCDTBT has effectively enhanced the efficiencies of the devices  This behavior would be due to the improvement of the MAPbI3-xClx film crystallinity and to the reduction of the recombination pathways due to the passivation of the trap states of the perovskite layer  Similar

2021 Fabrication of carbon-based  lead-free AgBiI4 Rudorffite solar cell with HCl as an additive Article 16 February 2024 1 Introduction Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells ( PSC ) have attracted considerable interest in the photovoltaic research due to their pleasing properties  including broadband light absorption  high absorption coefficient  adjustable and direct band gap  exciton binding energy  ambipolar charge transport  length diffusion of charge carriers and specially their simple solution fabrication process using low-cost materials [ 123456 ]  Their power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) has been improved over the last years  increasing from 39 to 252 % [ 7  8 ]  In order to go beyond the current world record  more efforts need to been done to understand the processes behind and to wisely improve the absorber layer and the corresponding architecture of the solar cell ( SC )  Optimization of the structure of devices as well as the one of perovskite film deposition methodology are the two important factors for getting SCs with good conversion efficiency  In this context  many efforts and methods have been developed on different components of PSCs to improve photovoltaic performance  including the use of various organic and inorganic hole transport materials [ 9  10 ]  elaboration of deposition processes [ 11  12 ]  optimization of electron transport layer thickness [ 13 ]  application of different treatments [ 14  15 ] and optimization of the perovskite structure [ 16 ]  The structure and composition of the perovskite is one of the important parameters that can influence the performance of perovskite solar cells  Cesium and rubidium cations were added in perovskite structure to improve the stability of the cells [ 17 ]  Mixed-cation perovskite solar cells based on Cs017FA083Pb ( Br04I06 ) 3 with an efficiency of 17 % were reported [ 18 ]  Thus  the doping of the cation sites has considerably improved the photovoltaic performances as well as the stability  while the use of two halogens had a positive impact on transport properties  Among all mixed halide perovskite films  the mixed halide containing I and Cl in MA perovskite-based ( MAPbI3-xClx ) has attracted deductive attention due to its long carrier diffusion length [ 19  20 ]  However  some problems still prevent the perovskite solar cells to reach higher values of PCE due to the diffusion lengths of the electrons and the corresponding holes  as well as due to the uncontrollable crystalline quality of the perovskite film  To overcome these difficulties  various methods involving interface modification as well as doping of perovskite material with an organic material have been developed  Therefore  the poly [ N- 9′-heptadecanyl-27-carbazole-alt-55- ( 47-di-2-thienyl-2′1′3′-benzothiadiazole ] ( PCDTBT ) was found to be a good doping material  In fact  it is a hole transport material  generally used in organic polymer solar cells  Its highest level of molecular orbital energy ( HOMO ) is in order of 545 eV [ 21 ]  corresponding well with the one of MAPbI3-xClx ( 54 eV )  It also presents a broad absorption in the visible range  The repeating unit of PCDTBT possesses lone electron pairs attached to its S and N atoms  which can effectively passivate the under-coordinated Pb ions in the perovskite film  In this paper  we developed a planar inverted solar cell based on mixed halide perovskite MAPbI3-xClx  The effects of PCDTBT additive to the MAPbI3-xClx perovskite films on the performance of the cells were investigated  2 Experimental section 21 Solar cell fabrication Solar cell devices were fabricated on Indium tin oxide ( ITO ) -coated glass  After laser graving  the patterned ITO glass ( resistance 15 Ω sq−1 ) was cleaned by ultrasonication sequentially in acetone  isopropyl and deionized water for 10 min  The PEDOT : PSS layer was deposited on the cleaned substrate through spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 40 s  followed by annealing treatment at 180 °C for 1 h Afterward  a blend perovskite precursor solutions of methylammonium iodide and lead ( II ) chloride were dissolved in N  Ndimethylformamide ( DMF ) at a 3:1 M ratio  respectively  for MAI : PbCl2 with and without the addition of the PCDTBT ( 02 mgml−1 ) and then stirred at room temperature overnight in glove box  After that  the perovskite solution was used to spin-coat the PEDOT : PSS surface at 4000 rpm for 40 s The perovskite films were then heated at 100 °C for 30 min  After the thermal annealing of the perovskite layer  the electron transport material PC60BM ( [ 66 ] -phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester ) ( 30 mg/ml in Chlorobenzene ) was deposited on the top of perovskite film by spin-coating at 1500 rpm for 60 s The whole fabrication process was completed after the thermal evaporation of a 8 nm BCP ( Bathocuproine – 29-Dimethyl-47-diphenyl-110-phenanthroline ) and 100 nm Ag on top of the PC60BM layer  The schematic illustration of the planar inverted perovskite solar cell with the structure ITO/PEDOT : PSS/CH3NH3PbI3-xClx : PCDTBT/PC60BM/BCP/Ag is shown in Fig  1  Fig  1 figure 1 ( a ) Structure of the device  ( b ) schematic energy-level diagram and ( c ) molecular structures of the mixed halide perovskite MAPbI3-xClx and the PCDTBT Full size image 22 Characterization The X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) patterns of the thin films were measured by a Siemens D5000 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation ( λ = 154 Å )  The UV–Vis spectra were collected using a PerkinElmer Instruments  Lamda 35 spectrophotometer  The surface morphologies were inspected by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM  LEO 1530 )  Photoluminescence spectra have been recorded using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 35 spectrophotometer  Photoluminescence spectra have been performed with a “ Jobin Yvon-Spex Spectrum One ” CCD detector  cooled at liquid nitrogen temperature  The current–voltage characteristics under illumination AM 15 G ( 100 mWcm − 2 ) with Xe Oriel solar simulator were obtained with a Keithley 2402 source  3 Results and discussion 31 Current density–voltage ( J–V ) characteristics Two cells configurations  ITO/PEDOT : PSS/MAPbI3-xClx/PC60BM/BCP/Ag and the ITO/PEDOT : PSS/MAPbI3-xClx + PCDTBT/PC60BM/BCP/Ag  were characterized  The selected J–V curves of the devices are presented in Fig  2  while the extracted photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1  Fig  2 figure 2 Current density–voltage ( J–V ) characteristics of the MAPbI3-xClx-based solar cells with and without PCDTBT Full size image Table 1 Photovoltaic performance of the best PSCs based on doped and undoped MAPbI3-xClx Full size table According to the present studies  the cell performances were improved by the addition of PCDTBT  the efficiency increasing with more than 2 % ( 93 % of the MAPbI3-xClx vs 116 % of the mixed cell with mixed absorber layer )  This improvement is the consequence of the enhancement of all the photovoltaic parameters  including Voc  Jsc and FF  The increases of Voc from 089 V to 094 V and of the fill factor FF from 53 % to 56 % might be correlated with a reduced the charge recombination in the absorber layer  The short-circuit current density ( JSC ) has increased from 1960 mA/cm2 to 2183 mA/cm2  which can be attributed also to a better light absorption in the perovskite doped with PCDTBT  as compared with the pure perovskite one  32 UV–Vis spectra and luminescent properties The optical properties of the absorber layers elaborated on ITO/Glass substrates are further examined  Figure 3a displays the UV–Vis absorption spectra for the doped and undoped films  It can be seen that all the perovskite thin films had a broad optical absorption range from 400 to 800 nm  All films showed a sharp absorption increase around 745 nm  corresponding to the bandgap transition [ 22  23 ]  A second peak at 490 nm is associated to the direct optical transition of the iodinated lead octahedron PbI6 [ 24 ]  As shown in the figures  the addition of the PCDTBT did not change the shape of the absorption spectrum of perovskite  but has significantly increased absorption intensity of the perovskite films in the 400–800 nm range  mainly due to PCDTBT addition and its strong absorption  Higher absorbance leads to more generated charges  which can boost the performances of the solar cell ( Fig  3 )  Fig  3 figure 3 a The absorption spectrum of films based on MAPbIxCl3-x : PCDTBT ( 02 mg mL−1 ) and MAPbIxCl3-x and b the absorption spectrum of PCDTBT ( inset ) Full size image The bandgap energy of the undoped and doped perovskite films was estimated from the Tauc plot curve ( Fig  4 )  The calculated gap values are 156 eV and 157 for the pure and doped perovskite  respectively  The energy gap has increased by PCDTBT doping which could contribute in the increase of open-circuit voltage  Fig  4 figure 4 Tauc plot of pure and doped perovskite Full size image In order to verify the effect of PCDTBT doping on the mechanism of the charge separation  a steady-state photoluminescence ( PL ) study was carried out  Figure 5 presents the steady PL spectra of the perovskite films fabricated with and without PCDTBT  All the PL spectra show an emission peaks at 760 nm  These peaks show a slight shift towards the longest wavelength relative to the peak of the absorptions with a bandgap of 163 eV  which is known as the Stokes shift [ 25 ]  Fig  5 figure 5 PL spectra of films based on MAPbIxCl3-x with and without adding PCDTBT Full size image Further  as shown in Fig  5  the undoped perovskite film presents the highest PL intensity  indicating the recombination of charge carriers in the perovskite film  On the other hand  since the doping of the PCDTBT to the perovskite  the intensity of the PL has been reduced  which clearly demonstrates the efficiency separation of the charge carriers and the fast transportation of the holes to the PEDOT : PSS layer that can minimize the recombination pathways due to passivation of the trap states of the perovskite layer [ 26  27 ]  These results are explained by the good alignment of the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbit ( HOMO ) between the PEDOT : PSS ( 53 eV )  PCDTBT ( 545 eV ) and perovskite ( 55 eV )  Furthermore  the PCDTBT has reacted as a good hole collector between the PEDOT : PSS and the perovskite layer  It extracts the holes in the perovskite layer towards the HOMO of the PEDOT : PSS  which led to the suppression of charge recombination and the increase of the PL intensity  Adding PCDTBT to the perovskite solution can effectively passivate these traps and significantly reduce interface charge recombination  which stimulates the JSC and FF device  We can conclude that the addition of PCDTBT as doping material had improved the extraction and charge transfer from the perovskite absorber to the PEDOT : PSS before recombination at the interface  Besides  it can effectively passivate these hole traps and significantly reduce interface charge recombination  which stimulates the VOC device  33 Perovskite thin-film structure : X-ray analyses To gain insight into the effect of the PCDTBT additive on the crystal structure of the perovskite material  X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) data were collected for the diffraction patterns of the films  Figure 6 shows the XRD diagrams of the perovskite films deposited from MAPbI3-xClx and MAPbI3-xClx doped with PCDTBT precursor solution  Fig  6 figure 6 XRD patterns of the MAPbI3-xClx perovskite films with and without PCDTBT Full size image All the XRD patterns of the perovskite films show a tetragonal structure of the perovskite ( MAPbI3 ) with a characteristic peak located at 1409°  2847°3171° and 4329°  which are assigned separately to the ( 110 )  ( 220 )  ( 310 ) and ( 330 ) planes [ 282930 ]  We note also the presence of a peak at 2Θ = 1499°  corresponding to the plane ( 100 ) which is attributed to the pure chlorinated perovskite MAPbCl3 [ 31 ]  A small peak at 1245° is also marked which is attributed to the plane ( 001 ) of PbI2  It should be noted that no PbCl2 peak is observed in all the XRD spectra  indicating that the starting PbCl2 precursor is completely consumed in reaction with MAI to form the MAPbI3-xClx  It is clearly demonstrated that the addition of PCDTBT has caused an interesting effect on the diffraction patterns  This is observed by the increase of the intensity of the diffractions peak after the incorporation of the PCDTBT which clearly indicates a significant improvement in the degree of crystallinity of the perovskite film  In order to better analyze the effect of the incorporation of PCDTBT  it is very interesting to evaluate the crystallinity of the samples over the full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) of characteristic diffraction peaks  Thereby  the maximum values of full width at half maximum FWHM in the planes ( 110 ) were extracted from the X-ray diffraction patterns and their variations with and without the addition of PCDTBT are summarized in Table 2  Table 2 The full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) of ( 110 ) diffraction peak extracted from the XRD patterns Full size table The value of the FWHM is 0336° for pure MAPbI3-xClx  whereas this value has decreased to 0293° after PCDTBT doping  Furthermore  a gradually and slightly broadened FWHM of XRD suggests that the crystallite sizes increase for the films doped with PCDTBT contents from 2381 nm to 2731 nm  These crystallite sizes for the main peak ( 110 ) were determined by Debye–Scherrer equation ( Eq  1 ) [ 32 ]  λ β ( 1 ) where L is the average crystallite size  λ is the X-ray wavelength in nanometer ( nm )  β is the peak width of the diffraction peak profile at half maximum height resulting from small crystallite size in radians and K is a constant related to crystallite shape  normally taken as 09  Indeed  the FWHM is a good sense for the existence of defects formed in the semiconductor layer and usually  the existence of crystalline defects causes the widening of the FWHM peak and conversely [ 33 ]  A moderate excess of PbI2 in the doped perovskite film is noted  The ratio calculation of PbI2 relative to the amount of MAPI is in order of 0035 and 00175 for pure and doped perovskite  respectively  According to the literature  the presence of PbI2 is beneficial as a passivation of defects [ 34 ]  Hence  the XRD analyses have demonstrated that the incorporation of PCDTBT has improved the perovskite film crystallinity  which subsequently has reduced the default that can cause the charge recombination  34 Scanning electron microscopy Figure 7 shows the SEM images of the MAPbI3-xClx films deposited on ITO substrate covered by a PEDOT : PSS layer in top view of surface  with and without the PCDTBT addition  Fig  7 figure 7 The top SEM morphology images of perovskite crystal films with different concentrations of PCDTBT ; ( a ) CH3NH3PbI3-xClx  ( b ) CH3NH3PbI3-xClx : PCDTBT ( 02 mg mL−1 ) Full size image Both samples show a uniform  compact film with full surface coverage  The perovskite film consists of grains with sizes around 200 nm which are closely related ( Fig  2a )  When 2 mg of PCDTBT was added in the perovskite precursor  there was a remarkable change in the film morphology in terms of grain size and coverage of film ( Fig  2b )  We can observe that the PCDTBT was distributed in the final film and the grain size of the perovskite film has increased after it was added  In fact  the grains become larger with a crystallite around 300–400 nm which could be attributed to better crystallization of the perovskite layer  This enhancement of the grain size can affect the carrier mobility and the charge recombination which led to higher efficiency  Thus  we can note the presence of more grains with a slight contrast in the grain boundaries  which is consistent with the enhancement of the PbI2 intensity phase in the XRD measurement  35 Hysteresis effect A slight hysteresis phenomenon was seen for the device with the doped perovskite  Figure 8 shows the J–V plots of the solar cell with doped perovskite measured in opposite scan directions and the extracted parameters are summarized in Table 3  This cell achieves a PCE of 116 % with a VOC of 0940 V  a JSC of 2183 mA/cm2  and a FF of 56 % when measured under forward voltage scan and a slight lower PCE of 108 % with a VOC of 0934 V  a JSC of 2154 mA/cm2  and an FF of 54 % for the reverse scan  This small hysteresis can be attributed to various physical causes such the presence of a high density of defects inside or on the surface of the material [ 353637 ]  Fig  8 figure 8 J–V plots of solar cell using the perovskite doped with PCDTBT with forward and reverse Full size image Table 3 Photovoltaic performance of PSC based on doped MAPbI3-xClx with forward and reverse scan Full size table 4 Conclusion In summary  inverted perovskite solar cells based on MAPbI3-xClx with and without PCDTBT as doping materials were fabricated  It was shown that the PCDTBT additive can effectively increase the device performance  It can greatly facilitate the crystallization process of the perovskite film and effectively minimize the charge carrier ’ s recombination owing to the interface created between PCDTBT and the perovskite  As a result  the PCDTBT-based doped device has shown significantly improved performance than the undoped perovskite devices  Finally  we have successfully achieved a PCE of 116 % with a Jsc of 2183 mA/cm2  a VOC of 0940 V and a FF of 56 %  Data availability All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published manuscripterovskite solar cells ( PSC ) have shown extraordinary progress

would be due to the improvement of the MAPbI3-xClx film crystallinity and to the reduction of the recombination pathways due to the passivation of the trap states of the perovskite layer  Similar

Figure 3a displays the UV–Vis absorption spectra for the doped and undoped films  It can be seen that all the perovskite thin films had a broad optical absorption range from 400 to 800 nm  All films showed a sharp absorption increase around 745 nm  corresponding to the bandgap transition [ 22  23 ]  A second peak at 490 nm is associated to the direct optical transition of the iodinated lead octahedron PbI6 [ 24 ]  As shown in the figures  the addition of the PCDTBT did not change the shape of the absorption spectrum of perovskite  but has significantly increased absorption intensity of the perovskite films in the 400–800 nm range  mainly due to PCDTBT addition and its strong absorption  Higher absorbance leads to more generated charges  which can boost the performances of the solar cell ( Fig  3 )  Fig  3 figure 3 a The absorption spectrum of films based on MAPbIxCl3-x : PCDTBT ( 02 mg mL−1 ) and MAPbIxCl3-x and b the absorption spectrum of PCDTBT ( inset ) Full size image The bandgap energy of the undoped and doped perovskite films was estimated from the Tauc plot curve ( Fig  4 )  The calculated gap values are 156 eV and 157 for the pure and doped perovskite  respectively  The energy gap has increased by PCDTBT doping which could contribute in the increase of open-circuit voltage  Fig  4 figure 4 Tauc plot of pure and doped perovskite Full size image In order to verify the effect of PCDTBT doping on the mechanism of the charge separation  a steady-state photoluminescence ( PL ) study was carried out  Figure 5 presents the steady PL spectra of the perovskite films fabricated with and without PCDTBT  All the PL spectra show an emission peaks at 760 nm  These peaks show a slight shift towards the longest wavelength relative to the peak of the absorptions with a bandgap of 163 eV  which is known as the Stokes shift [ 25 ]  Fig  5 figure 5 PL spectra of films based on MAPbIxCl3-x with and without adding PCDTBT Full size image Further  as shown in Fig  5  the undoped perovskite film presents the highest PL intensity  indicating the recombination of charge carriers in the perovskite film  On the other hand  since the doping of the PCDTBT to the perovskite  the intensity of the PL has been reduced  which clearly demonstrates the efficiency separation of the charge carriers and the fast transportation of the holes to the PEDOT : PSS layer that can minimize the recombination pathways due to passivation of the trap states of the perovskite layer [ 26  27 ]  These results are explained by the good alignment of the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbit ( HOMO ) between the PEDOT : PSS ( 53 eV )  PCDTBT ( 545 eV ) and perovskite ( 55 eV )  Furthermore  the PCDTBT has reacted as a good hole collector between the PEDOT : PSS and the perovskite layer  It extracts the holes in the perovskite layer towards the HOMO of the PEDOT : PSS  which led to the suppression of charge recombination and the increase of the PL intensity  Adding PCDTBT to the perovskite solution can effectively passivate these traps and significantly reduce interface charge recombination  which stimulates the JSC and FF device  We can conclude that the addition of PCDTBT as doping material had improved the extraction and charge transfer from the perovskite absorber to the PEDOT : PSS before recombination at the interface  Besides  it can effectively passivate these hole traps and significantly reduce interface charge recombination  which stimulates the VOC device  33 Perovskite thin-film structure : X-ray analyses To gain insight into the effect of the PCDTBT additive on the crystal structure of the perovskite material  X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) data were collected for the diffraction patterns of the films  Figure 6 shows the XRD diagrams of the perovskite films deposited from MAPbI3-xClx and MAPbI3-xClx doped with PCDTBT precursor solution  Fig  6 figure 6 XRD patterns of the MAPbI3-xClx perovskite films with and without PCDTBT Full size image All the XRD patterns of the perovskite films show a tetragonal structure of the perovskite ( MAPbI3 ) with a characteristic peak located at 1409°  2847°3171° and 4329°  which are assigned separately to the ( 110 )  ( 220 )  ( 310 ) and ( 330 ) planes [ 282930 ]  We note also the presence of a peak at 2Θ = 1499°  corresponding to the plane ( 100 ) which is attributed to the pure chlorinated perovskite MAPbCl3 [ 31 ]  A small peak at 1245° is also marked which is attributed to the plane ( 001 ) of PbI2  It should be noted that no PbCl2 peak is observed in all the XRD spectra  indicating that the starting PbCl2 precursor is completely consumed in reaction with MAI to form the MAPbI3-xClx  It is clearly demonstrated that the addition of PCDTBT has caused an interesting effect on the diffraction patterns  This is observed by the increase of the intensity of the diffractions peak after the incorporation of the PCDTBT which clearly indicates a significant improvement in the degree of crystallinity of the perovskite film  In order to better analyze the effect of the incorporation of PCDTBT  it is very interesting to evaluate the crystallinity of the samples over the full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) of characteristic diffraction peaks  Thereby  the maximum values of full width at half maximum FWHM in the planes ( 110 ) were extracted from the X-ray diffraction patterns and their variations with and without the addition of PCDTBT are summarized in Table 2  Table 2 The full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) of ( 110 ) diffraction peak extracted from the XRD patterns Full size table The value of the FWHM is 0336° for pure MAPbI3-xClx  whereas this value has decreased to 0293° after PCDTBT doping  Furthermore  a gradually and slightly broadened FWHM of XRD suggests that the crystallite sizes increase for the films doped with PCDTBT contents from 2381 nm to 2731 nm  These crystallite sizes for the main peak ( 110 ) were determined by Debye–Scherrer equation ( Eq  1 ) [ 32 ]  λ β ( 1 ) where L is the average crystallite size  λ is the X-ray wavelength in nanometer ( nm )  β is the peak width of the diffraction peak profile at half maximum height resulting from small crystallite size in radians and K is a constant related to crystallite shape  normally taken as 09  Indeed  the FWHM is a good sense for the existence of defects formed in the semiconductor layer and usually  the existence of crystalline defects causes the widening of the FWHM peak and conversely [ 33 ]  A moderate excess of PbI2 in the doped perovskite film is noted  The ratio calculation of PbI2 relative to the amount of MAPI is in order of 0035 and 00175 for pure and doped perovskite  respectively  According to the literature  the presence of PbI2 is beneficial as a passivation of defects [ 34 ]  Hence  the XRD analyses have demonstrated that the incorporation of PCDTBT has improved the perovskite film crystallinity  which subsequently has reduced the default that can cause the charge recombination  34 Scanning electron microscopy Figure 7 shows the SEM images of the MAPbI3-xClx films deposited on ITO substrate covered by a PEDOT : PSS layer in top view of surface  with and without the PCDTBT addition  Fig  7 figure 7 The top SEM morphology images of perovskite crystal films with different concentrations of PCDTBT ; ( a ) CH3NH3PbI3-xClx  ( b ) CH3NH3PbI3-xClx : PCDTBT ( 02 mg mL−1 ) Full size image Both samples show a uniform  compact film with full surface coverage  The perovskite film consists of grains with sizes around 200 nm which are closely related ( Fig  2a )  When 2 mg of PCDTBT was added in the perovskite precursor  there was a remarkable change in the film morphology in terms of grain size and coverage of film ( Fig  2b )  We can observe that the PCDTBT was distributed in the final film and the grain size of the perovskite film has increased after it was added  In fact  the grains become larger with a crystallite around 300–400 nm which could be attributed to better crystallization of the perovskite layer  This enhancement of the grain size can affect the carrier mobility and the charge recombination which led to higher efficiency  Thus  we can note the presence of more grains with a slight contrast in the grain boundaries  which is consistent with the enhancement of the PbI2 intensity phase in the XRD measurement  35 Hysteresis effect A slight hysteresis phenomenon was seen for the device with the doped perovskite  Figure 8 shows the J–V plots of the solar cell with doped perovskite measured in opposite scan directions and the extracted parameters are summarized in Table 3  This cell achieves a PCE of 116 % with a VOC of 0940 V  a JSC of 2183 mA/cm2  and a FF of 56 % when measured under forward voltage scan and a slight lower PCE of 108 % with a VOC of 0934 V  a JSC of 2154 mA/cm2  and an FF of 54 % for the reverse scan  This small hysteresis can be attributed to various physical causes such the presence of a high density of defects inside or on the surface of the material [ 353637 ]  Fig  8 figure 8 J–V plots of solar cell using the perovskite doped with PCDTBT with forward and reverse Full size image Table 3 Photovoltaic performance of PSC based on doped MAPbI3-xClx with forward and reverse scan Full size table 4 Conclusion In summary  inverted perovskite solar cells based on MAPbI3-xClx with and without PCDTBT as doping materials were fabricated  It was shown that the PCDTBT additive can effectively increase the device performance  It can greatly facilitate the crystallization process of the perovskite film and effectively minimize the charge carrier ’ s recombination owing to the interface created between PCDTBT and the perovskite  As a result  the PCDTBT-based doped device has shown significantly improved performance than the undoped perovskite devices  Finally  we have successfully achieved a PCE of 116 % with a Jsc of 2183 mA/cm2  a VOC of 0940 V and a FF of 56 %  Data availabilityRecent advances of a hot-casting technique used to deposit high-quality perovskite films are reviewed  Perovskite films with large grain size  uniform

stability Article 18 June 2019 Growth of metal halide perovskite materials Article 03 June 2020 1 Introduction The development of low-cost and high-efficiency solar cells has attracted interest worldwide from both the academy and industry  Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite has recently emerged as an efficient light-absorbing layer in photovoltaic applications with unique properties including a high absorption coefficient  tunable bandgap  and solution processing capability [ 12345678 ]  The improvement in the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) is mainly due to the effective control of the film morphology and the interfacial defect passivation  Therefore  the choice of deposition technique is particularly important  One-step spin coating [ 9101112 ]  sequential deposition [ 13 ]  two-step spin coating [ 14  15 ]  and vapor deposition [ 2  16 ] have been widely used to deposit high-quality perovskite films  Despite being fairly complicated  sequential deposition and two-step spin coating exhibit good repeatability and high controllability  Vapor deposition is suitable for planar devices with a high film uniformity  although deposition under a strong vacuum is expensive  Crystallization in a conventional one-step spin coating is difficult to control because the deposition environment such as the humidity and temperature seriously affects the repeatability  and the thermal annealing process involves evaporation of the solvent and volatilization of the organic components  Hot-casting technology has recently been developed in the deposition of high-quality perovskite thin films with notable advantages  such as a rapid crystallization  short film formation process  large increase in the grain size  preferred crystalline orientation  and low defect states [ 171819 ]  A direct formation mechanism has been proposed within the framework of nucleation growth theory [ 20 ]  A high substrate temperature provides the necessary driving force for the phase change  resulting in an ultrashort crystallization process  Meanwhile  sufficient thermal energy also facilitates the diffusion of atoms in a liquid without the formation of an intermediate phase  Nie et al  first reported this methodology and further improved the film quality by optimizing the deposition parameters  such as the substrate temperature [ 19  21 ]  annealing temperature [ 22 ]  and precursor composition [ 11 ]  This technology has recently been extended to the deposition of a variety of perovskite films  including organic–inorganic hybrid  all-inorganic  lead-free  and low-dimensional perovskite films [ 232425 ]  In this review  the recent developments and advances of the hot-casting deposition of perovskite films are comprehensively summarized and discussed from the perspective of film quality  defects  carrier recombination  and stability  First  classic nucleation and crystal growth theory are revisited  The effects of different deposition parameters in a hot-casting technique  including the substrate temperature  thermal annealing  precursor chemistry  and atmosphere  are further discussed  Next  the advantages of this promising technology are discussed in terms of grain size  uniform thickness  and preferred crystalline orientation  The implementation of this technology in different types of perovskite film deposition has also been reviewed  Finally  some open questions and future perspectives regarding the maturity of this technology toward the upscaled manufacturing of perovskite-related optoelectronic devices are presented  2 Hot-Casting Technology 21 Fundamentals of Nucleation and Crystal Growth Classic nucleation and the crystal growth mechanism are first revisited [ 262728 ]  Figure 1a describes a schematic illustration of a hot-casting process for perovskite film deposition  The hot-casting technology aims to spin coat a hot precursor solution on a substrate maintained at higher temperature  Factors such as the substrate temperature  solution concentration  solvent  and supersaturated environment affect crystal growth  These deposition parameters are comprehensively discussed and correlated with the processes of nucleation and growth  as indicated in a LaMer diagram  Fig  1 figure 1 a Schematic illustration of the hot-casting process  b LaMer diagram for crystallite formation stages in a solution [ 29 ]  Copyright © 1950 American Chemical Society  c Time-dependent grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering ( GIWAXS ) profiles of the perovskite film drop cast on the 70 °C substrate and d 180 °C substrate from a solution to a solid state ( 0–40 min ) [ 20 ]  Copyright © 2016 American Chemical Society Full size image 211 Classical Nucleation and Classical Growth There are three classic nucleation and growth models of thin films  including the Volmer–Weber model  Frank–van der Merwe model  and Stranski–Krastanov model [ 30313233 ]  For the nucleation and growth of most polycrystalline thin films  the Volmer–Weber model is valid if the substrate temperature is sufficiently high and the deposited atoms have a certain diffusion capability  Therefore  our discussion is based on the Volmer–Weber model for hot casting process with unique film-forming characteristics  In classical nucleation theory  the solution must be in a supersaturated state to initiate crystallization  Nucleation with preferential nucleation sites is called a heterogeneous nucleation  which means that new phases are preferentially formed within certain regions of a liquid phase  During the process of thermodynamic nucleation  the system needs to overcome an energy barrier  which is the maximum free energy of critical nucleation (  ( Delta G^ { * }  ) )  $ $ Delta G^ { * } = frac { { 16pi sigma^ { 3 } } } { { 3Delta G_ { v } } } $ $ ( 1 ) where  ( sigma ) is the interface free energy  and  ( Delta G_ { v }  ) is the bulk free energy  Formation of nuclei in solution is closely related to the critical radius ( r * ) : $ $ r^ { * } = frac { 2sigma } { { Delta G_ { v } } } $ $ ( 2 ) when r < r *  the crystal nucleus is unstable ; when r = r *  the crystal nucleus is in a metastable state ; when r > r *  it is converted into a stable crystal nucleus and large nucleation begins  Therefore  r * represents a critical value for the transition from an unstable crystal nucleus to a stable crystal nucleus  ie  r * represents the minimum size at which the particles are further grown in a solution without being dissolved  212 LaMer Mechanism According to the typical concentration distribution curve in the LaMer diagram shown in Fig  1b  the process of nucleation and growth can be divided into three stages  ie  regions I  II  and III  representing the prenucleation  nucleation  and growth stages  respectively  In LaMer mode  the level of atomic concentration is the direct control factor for generating the crystal nuclei and achieving the particle size growth  Here  Cs is the solubility limit of the solution  Cc is the critical concentration of the solution  and Cm is the maximum supersaturation  In the 0–t1 segment  the centrifugal force and substrate temperature promote the solvent evaporation and increase the solution concentration of precursor until reaching Cs  although no obvious nucleation occurs at this point  The deposition temperature  precursor solution concentration  deposition rate  and solvent composition will affect the prenucleation stage  In the t1–t2 segment  the concentration of the solution reaches the critical level of nucleation  and the nucleation radius is larger than r *  The nucleation is transformed into a stable crystal nucleus  and a stable heterogeneous nucleus is formed at the beginning of slow nucleation  After the precursor solution is dropped onto the substrate  when the binding energy between the crystal nucleus and the adsorption atom is higher than the binding energy between the adsorption atom and the substrate  the crystal nucleus is more likely to form islands in combination with the diffusion-migrating atom  During the nucleation stage of the hot-casting process  a high substrate temperature  a diffusion capacity of the deposited atoms  and wettability between the deposited material and the substrate are essential requirements  Simultaneously  the precursor chemistry such as the solution aging time  solution composition  and solvent selection are important factors  The nucleation rate in t2–t3 segment is rapidly increasing  Secondary nucleation occurs in an irregular channel  The distance between the islands gradually decreases and merges into a large island or forms a continuous film  At this stage  the solution concentration is closely related to the nucleation and growth rate  The balance of the nucleation and growth rate effectively improves the film coverage [ 34 ]  When the solution concentration is below the critical supersaturation  nucleation stops owing to a low concentration of the solution [ 35 ]  The thermal annealing facilitate a fine control of the volatilization of the components and solvents  and ultimately a high-quality perovskite film is obtained  22 Temperature and Thermal Annealing 221 Direct Formation Mechanism The substrate temperature and thermal annealing play crucial roles in nucleation growth  When the substrate temperature is relatively low ( less than 100 °C )  the perovskite film formation process is divided into three stages : the initial solution stage  the transition-to-solid film stage  and the transformation stage from intermediates into a perovskite film [ 36 ]  However  when the substrate temperature is increased ( 100–180 °C )  the formation of the perovskite film adopts a direct formation mechanism [ 20 ]  Figure 1c  d shows in situ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering ( GIWAXS ) curves of perovskite from the precursor solution to the perovskite film at different substrate temperatures of 70 and 180 °C  respectively  The X-ray data are acquired after a regular time interval  and the time coordinate ( right ) represents the characteristic peak obtained within each frame interval  The peak of the scattering vector ( Q ) at ~ 4  8  and 87 nm−1 is attributed to the PbI2–solvent complex  The peak at Q = 120 nm−1 is assigned to the intermediate-stage MAPbCl3–solvent complex  whereas the peak at Q = 102 nm−1 is due to the perovskite stage  The intermediate MAPbCl3 and PbI2–solvent complex was not seen in the film grown at 180 °C  This indicates that there is no intermediate phase formation during the hot-casting process  since sufficient thermal energy is provided to accelerate the reactant diffusion and interaction  222 Substrate Temperature The substrate temperature affects the nucleation rate and film morphology by changing the supersaturation of the solution  Nie et al  first reported a strong correlation between the substrate temperature and grain size during a hot-casting process ( Fig  2a )  as well as the mobility and final PCE ( Fig  2b–d )  When the substrate temperature is higher than the crystallization temperature of the perovskite phase  the high boiling solvent promotes a stable growth of the perovskite crystal with large crystal grains  When the substrate temperature is increased to 180 °C  a grain size of 180 μm and charge mobility of 20 cm2 V−1 s−1 are obtained in the perovskite film  A large-grain perovskite film improves the device performance in two ways  reducing the crystal interface and lowering the defect density  thus increasing the mobility and suppressing the charge trapping [ 19 ]  Fig  2 figure 2 a Comparison of grain size as a function of the processing temperature  b Average overall PCE ( left ) and Jsc ( right ) as a function of crystalline grain size  c PCE values are correlated with the bulk mobility of the perovskite layer ( the labels correspond to the average grain size )  d Average J–V characteristics resulted by sweeping the voltage from forward to reverse bias and from reverse to forward bias [ 19 ]  Copyright © 2017 American Association for the Advancement of Science  e PL and f TRPL spectra of unannealed and annealed perovskites [ 22 ]  Copyright © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA  Weinheim Full size image 223 Thermal Annealing Yang et al  further described the Volmer–Weber growth mechanism for the formation of island-like grains and the transition to a dense perovskite film in a hot-casting process [ 37 ]  The thermal energy plays a key role in accelerating the crystallization of perovskite and the diffusion of the precursor  which directly determines the film morphology ( Fig  1b )  For instance  the thermal energy can reduce the surface tension between the precursor solution and the substrate  thus enhancing the tendency to form large islands with reduced surface defects ( such as vacancies  dislocations  and grain boundaries )  As the temperature further increases  it was observed that isolated islands grow and begin to form bonds with each other  eventually forming a high-quality perovskite film without pinholes  Thermal annealing not only promotes the solvent evaporation and accelerates the material transport within the film  but also improves the charge transport in the perovskite film  Janssen et al  characterized the annealing procedure using in situ photoluminescence spectroscopy [ 22 ]  The thermal annealing of the perovskite layer on poly ( 34-ethylenedioxythiophene ) /poly ( styrenesulfonate ) ( PEDOT : PSS ) affects the photoluminescence properties  as shown in Fig  2e  f The luminescence intensity after annealing was 7 times lower than that of the as-cast film  and the photoluminescence lifetime ( 72 ns for a single-index fit ) was significantly shorter than that of the as-cast film ( double exponential lifetime of 21 and 267 ns )  This difference was due to the increased charge carrier mobility or fewer defects in the annealed film  However  if the annealing temperature is too high and the annealing time is too long  it will promote the decomposition of the perovskite and eventually damage the photovoltaic performance  Ma et al  investigated the relationship between the thermal annealing and orientation of hot-casted PEA2MA2Pb3I10 films [ 38 ]  Nateghi et al  also reported that the changes in annealing temperature and substrate temperature affect the morphology of the deposited film [ 39 ]  Flash infrared annealing ( FIRA ) can promote the formation and crystallization of perovskite films through rapid solvent removal  Compared to conventional thermal annealing  short heating pulses can significantly reduce the degradation of organic components even at an extremely high temperature [ 40  41 ]  Ren et al  found that the grain size distribution at the edge of the perovskite film prepared using hot casting is larger than the central size distribution and the particle size distribution is annular [ 42 ]  It is believed that a compensation flow from the center of the solution to the edge naturally occurs during the evaporation of the solvent  thus resulting in a higher concentration and larger grain size at the edges  23 Precursor Chemistry 231 Additives The perovskite precursor has a strong impact on the film morphology and device performance  such as the composition [ 43  44 ]  concentration [ 45 ]  solution aging time [ 46 ]  and solvent selection [ 47 ]  A poorly soluble inorganic lead salt requires the selection of strongly polar aprotic organic solvents  The boiling point and vapor pressure of the solvent determine the rate of solution evaporation  The viscosity of the solvent affects the substrate wettability and thus the film formation [ 48 ]  In addition  the Lewis-based nature of some high polar aprotic organic solvents can induce a solvent–solute coordination to modulate the crystallization process  Therefore  the solvation ability plays a key role in determining the perovskite crystallization process [ 49 ]  The perovskite precursor solution is regarded as a colloidal cluster with a soft colloidal skeleton  and several coordination complexes constitute the colloidal skeleton  The size of the colloidal clusters is controlled by additives ( Cl− and Br− ) [ 50 ]  Liao et al  reported that the incorporation of chlorine can improve the optoelectronic properties and environmental stability of perovskite films  The incorporation of 10 wt % Cl− into a MAPbI3 precursor solution significantly improves the film uniformity and coverage  An X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) pattern showed that increasing the chlorine amount induces a significant increase of the scattering intensity of the ( 110 ) plane  whereas the intensity of the ( 020 ) plane is decreased  indicating a promoted orientation in the direction of the ( 110 ) plane  The orientation is highly dependent on the halide distribution during the hot-casting process  The solvent evaporates instantly upon contact with the hot substrates and draws the preaggregated Cl−-rich domains toward the surfaces  Cl− preferentially distributes closer to the TiO2 substrates  and the included Cl− precursors tend to naturally aggregate owing to a lower solubility  Consequently  the rapid crystallization creates a gradient halide distribution as well as morphological changes  A high nucleation density and grain coarsening are further induced  A longer time-resolved photoluminescence ( TRPL ) lifetime was observed in a perovskite film with added chloride ions ( Fig  3a  b )  Improvements in the device performance have been ascribed to the improved uniformity of the perovskite film  good orientation of the perovskite crystals  and a longer carrier diffusion length  Wu et al  reported that Cl− can improve the film morphology by retarding the crystallization rate  whereas Br− can improve the open-circuit voltage ( Voc ) of the corresponding devices and stabilize the perovskite lattice [ 51 ]  Hao et al  reported that a slight excess of methylammonium iodide ( MAI ) in the precursor solution can compensate for the MAI loss owing to the high substrate temperature [ 52 ]  Significant increases in the grain size and crystallinity of the MAI-rich perovskite films were observed  Chen et al  further tuned the thickness of the perovskite layer within the range of 700–1600 nm by adjusting the substrate temperature ( 25–100 °C ) and the precursor concentration ( 1–2 M ) [ 53 ]  Figure 3c  d shows the UV–Vis absorption and external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra for the corresponding devices  Within the long-wavelength range  the absorption was enhanced from 25 to 70 °C  thereby contributing to enhanced light-harvesting and improved Jsc values  The photoluminescence ( PL ) intensity of a sample at 70 °C is much higher than that at 25 °C  indicating fewer trap states in the former  Gong et al  further used an ultrahigh-temperature substrate ( ~ 240 °C ) to deposit a perovskite film in a short time owing to the rapid evaporation of the solvent [ 54 ]  Fig  3 figure 3 a

precursor solution can affect the size and structure of the colloidal clusters  as well as the resultant nucleation and growth process  Mohite et al  reported a strong correlation between the aging time and film crystallinity [ 46 ]  The results showed that the crystallinity and grain size of perovskite films were significantly improved when the aging time of the precursor solution exceeds 24 h Figure 3e shows the average grain size as a function of the solution of aging time  Along with the grain size growth  the XRD peak ratio of the MAPbI3/MAPbCl3 film increased to 273 when the solution aging time reached 24 h ( Fig  3f )  The full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) of the peak of MAPbI3 at 1428° ( 110 ) exhibits an increase in the crystalline quality as the aging time increases to a certain value  As the precursor solution ages  it gradually forms large seeds ( or crystals )  The precursor aging has also been proven to significantly affect the grain growth  phase purity  surface uniformity  and trap state density of the perovskite film  Meanwhile  adjusting the solvents and composition of the precursor has a vital role in the phase formation and crystalline properties of the perovskite films  A BA2MA4Pb5I16 film deposited using a N  N-dimethylformamide ( DMF ) /dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) mixed solvent showed a strong preferential orientation  in which the ( 111 ) diffraction intensity was about tenfold higher than that prepared with a DMF solvent ( Fig  3g ) [ 17 ]  When the DMSO ratio increased  the FWHM of the ( 111 ) peak further decreased from 051° to 024° ( Fig  3h )  Wang et al  used gamma-butyrolactone ( GBL ) and DMF co-solvents to deposit perovskite films  It was reported that the grain size and photovoltaic parameters of the device from the GBL solvent were significantly lower than those from the DMF solvent [ 55 ]  In addition  Iyer et al  regulated the perovskite crystallization and grain growth with DMSO as a Lewis base adduct [ 56 ]  233 Composition and Other Factors The perovskite film morphology can be further tuned through the processing parameters  such as the substrate temperature  rotating speed  and thermal annealing  These processing parameters affect the solute diffusion and perovskite crystallization behavior through the thermal energy and centrifugal force  Thermal annealing promotes evaporation of the remaining organic residue  As shown in Fig  3i  the main diffraction peaks of ( n-BA ) 2 ( MA ) 3Pb4I13 and ( iso-BA ) 2 ( MA ) 3Pb4I13 films at 1410° and 2837° represent the ( 111 ) and ( 202 ) crystallographic planes  Compared with the diffraction peak of the hot-casted ( n-BA ) 2 ( MA ) 3Pb4I13 perovskite film  the diffraction intensities of ( iso-BA ) 2 ( MA ) 3Pb4I13 were higher and narrower  which indicates that the branched-chain spacers improved the crystallization of the two-dimensional ( 2D ) perovskites compared to the linear chain counterparts  In addition  the change in the diffraction intensity ratio between ( 111 ) and ( 202 ) of the hot-casted ( iso-BA ) 2 ( MA ) 3Pb4I13 film implies that the crystal orientation of the film changed substantially [ 18 ]  Moon et al  used MAI and lead acetate ( PbAc2 ) as precursors to form a high-quality perovskite layer [ 57 ]  The PbAc2 residue can be conveniently removed through by-product gas ( 3MAI + PbAc2  ( to ) MAPbI3 + 2MAAc ) to accelerate the crystal growth to form a fully covered  pinhole-free  and highly crystalline perovskite film  Janssen et al  prepared a high-quality perovskite layer from a mixture of PbAc2  PbI  and MAI [ 22 ]  Huang et al  reported the use of methylammonium acetate ( MAAc ) as a general solvent to deposit high-quality perovskite films in an ambient environment  A constant substrate temperature ( 100 °C ) was applied to promote solvent evaporation  resulting in supersaturation  and a rapid nucleation and crystal growth [ 58 ]  24 Atmosphere Different deposition conditions affect the crystallinity and surface morphology of as-cast perovskite films [ 59 ]  As one advantage of the hot-casting technology  the deposition is not sensitive to the processing environment ; in other words  perovskite films can be deposited in ambient air  and the device shows excellent humidity stability [ 60616263 ]  Mori et al  prepared MAPbI3 films under ambient conditions ( relative humidity = 42–48 % ) by combining a gas flow with hot-casting technology [ 64 ]  Owing to the difference in the centrifugal force between the center and edge of the substrate  the flowing gas can significantly accelerate the mass transfer and eliminate the nonuniformity of its thickness  Eslamian et al  prepared MAPbI3 perovskite films using a two-step sequential deposition method [ 65 ]  To achieve full coverage  a PbI2 solution with a low concentration was first sprayed onto a heated substrate as the substrate temperature neared the boiling point of the DMF solvent ( 153 °C )  The deposition of thick PbI2 films by high-temperature spraying is more conducive to the deposition of thicker perovskite films than a conventional method applied at RT  Aguiar et al  found that in situ exposure to water vapor reduced or possibly eliminated the Cl− retention in the FAPbI3−xClX crystals [ 66 ]  During the treatment of FAPbI3−xClx  water vapor induced halide loss in the perovskite crystals  The chemical bonds between chlorine and its surrounding elements are extremely weak and can be easily broken by residual water vapor  Yang et al  further combined hot-casting technology with methylamine ( MA ) gas treatment to prepare dense and uniform perovskite films under high relative humidity [ 67 ]  Porous and rough MAPbI3 perovskite films prepared using hot casting can be transformed into dense and high-quality films with MA gas treatment [ 68 ]  In addition  Hao et al  treated MAPbI3 perovskite films with nondestructive ethanol/chlorobenzene  resulting in a coarsening of the perovskite grains and lateral grain growth of the MAPbI3 perovskite films [ 69 ]  Cheng et al  introduced a thermal radiation hot-casting method to solve the problems of temperature gradient and moisture intrusion during the deposition process [ 70 ]  A 500 W tungsten filament was used as the heat source  A smooth and dense perovskite film was then deposited by controlling the humidity and temperature gradients under ambient air  25 Single-Crystal Growth and Other Functional Layers A single perovskite crystal exhibits advantages such as high light absorption  a long carrier lifetime  high carrier mobility  low trap state density  and excellent defect tolerance [ 71 ]  Liu et al  reported an induced peripheral crystallization ( IPC ) method to grow single crystals of multiple sizes ( C6H5C2H4NH3 ) 2PbI4 ( PEA2PbI4 )  Figure 4a illustrates a schematic of the single-crystal growth process of PEA2PbI4  The hot precursor solution was transferred to a glass substrate at a constant of 80 °C  Slides are placed on droplets of the precursor solution  followed by squeezing  baking  and cooling  Figure 4b shows the growth of PEA2PbI4 crystals at different stages  At 80 °C  the solution is unsaturated  and thus it is impossible to form microcrystals  The solvent evaporated and the local concentration gradually increased  When the temperature decreased to 72 °C  small crystals formed on the edges of the glass slide  Figure 4c shows well-shaped single crystals with habitant rectangular a parallelepiped formation in a closed petri dish [ 71 ]  In addition  Liu et al  developed a low-temperature gradient crystallization method to grow a single crystal of CH3NH3PbBr3 with high carrier mobility by adjusting the crystal nucleation and growth  as shown in Fig  4d  e [ 72 ]  Fig  4 figure 4 a Schematic illustration of the IPC procedure  b Photographs of PEA2PbI4 taken at different stages of the growth process  c Photograph of a typical PEA2PbI4 crystal [ 71 ]  Copyright © 2018

© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA  Weinheim Full size image A hot-casting technique can also be used to deposit other functional layers ( such as SnO2  TiO2  NiOx  cuprous thiocyanate ( CuSCN )  or cuprous iodide ( CuI ) )  For example  Lian et al  reported the hot-substrate deposition of poly ( 4-butylphenyl-diphenyl-amine ) ( PTPD ) as an effective hole transport layer ( HTL ) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) as an electron transport layer ( ETL ) [ 73 ]  The solvent volatilization caused by the hot substrate accelerates the self-organization of the PTPD  thereby improving the adhesion to the substrate with higher coverage and flatness  Hot-cast PCBM films show a higher uniformity and lower roughness  which helps reduce the current leakage and charge recombination  Hao et al  adjusted the deposition temperature of hot-cast NiOx films to change the coordination structure and charge state of the NiOx  In addition  the hole injection efficiency at the NiOx/perovskite interface was improved  and the charge accumulation at the interface was effectively avoided [ 74 ]  3 Advantages of Hot-Casting Technique 31 Grain Size  Film Thickness  and Orientation A hot-casting technique has been widely applied to obtain relatively thick and preferentially orientated large-grain perovskite films  The larger grain size endows a reduction of the grain boundaries of the perovskite film  At the same time  there is a positive influence on the absorption  charge transport  and crystallinity of the perovskite films [ 757677 ]  However  the increase in grain size may increase the density of the undesirable pinholes  resulting in direct contact between the HTL and ETL and the leakage current  The voids in the perovskite film will seriously damage the device performance [ 787980 ]  In addition  the optoelectronic performance of the perovskite film is not directly related to the size of the crystalline domains [ 81 ]  A thick perovskite layer contributes to the harvesting of sufficient light absorption across the visible light range  In general  the concentration of the precursor solution and the rotation speed can be adjusted to tune the thickness of the perovskite layer  A thickness-insensitive device performance was observed when applying the hot-casting technique  which is important for the large-scale implementation of this deposition technology  When a long-chain organic cation layer is inserted into the inorganic framework to deviate the tolerance_factor from a value of 1  the inorganic halide octahedrons are connected in a common apex and extend in a 2D direction to form 2D perovskites [ 82838485 ]  The insertion of an organic chain will hinder the charge extraction and collection  It is important to control the growth orientation of a 2D perovskite film to facilitate carrier transport  A preferentially orientated growth of 2D perovskites can be obtained through a hot-casting process  This enables the device to achieve an excellent carrier transferability and high PCE  Zhang et al  studied the crystal orientation of RT-cast and hot-cast BA2MA3Pb4I13 perovskite films using GIWAXS ( Fig  5a  b ) [ 86 ]  The Debye–Scherrer diffraction rings of a BA2MA3Pb4I13 film at RT indicated a random orientation  Otherwise  the 2D perovskite film deposited using the hot-casting method exhibited sharp and discrete Bragg spots along the same ring  indicative of the preferred orientation of a BA2MA3Pb4I13 film  A hot-casted film with a strong vertical orientation provides a direct pathway for electron and hole extraction  In addition  it was further reported that the out-of-plane orientation was significantly enhanced in the hot-casted ( iso-BA ) 2 ( MA ) 3Pb4I13 perovskite film by the sharp spots along qz in GIWAXS [ 18 ]  Kanatzidis et al  reported that a mixed solvent ( DMF : DMSO ) can induce a better crystallinity and preferential orientation of the hot-casted BA2MA4Pb5I16 film ( Fig  5c  d ) [ 17 ]  Compared with a pure DMF solvent  the DMF/DMSO mixed solvent dramatically increased the peak intensity of ( 111 ) and ( 202 ) by tenfold  As a possible reason for this  a small amount of polarized DMSO ( owing to the Sδ+ = Oδ− polarized bond ) in the precursor solution can form strong hydrogen bonds with the organic cation  which helps change the crystallization rate and increase the film crystallinity  This improves the carrier transport by controlling the degree of preferential orientation of the perovskite film  According to the density functional theory ( DFT )  the interface between the dimensional-reduced perovskite nuclei and the TiO2 substrate was calculated and analyzed ( Fig  5e ) [ 87 ]  BA- and MA-attached TiO2 substrates represent parallel and perpendicular orientations  respectively  After the geometry optimization  the interfacial energy of parallel and perpendicular orientated ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) 3Pb4I13/TiO2 is 05 and 89 eV  respectively  It is inferred that when a ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) 3Pb4I13 nucleus is formed on a TiO2 substrate  perpendicular orientations are highly thermodynamically preferred  Fig  5 figure 5 2D GIWAXS plots of BA2MA3Pb4I13 films

performance through the following pathways  The electrons fall back to the valence band  resulting in radiative recombination  Holes ( electrons ) are transferred back to the perovskite layer  resulting in minority recombination at the interface  The perovskite layer with pores will then cause direct contact with the functional layers  thereby generating carrier recombination  Numerous defect states in the device form recombination centers to capture the carriers  causing a nonradiative recombination process  Some deep-level traps are the main pathway for a carrier loss  In addition  the nonradiative recombination of carriers inside the device also directly affects the achievable Voc of the PSCs  Therefore  the deposition of low-defective perovskite thin films is important for suppressing nonradiative recombination  For hot-casted perovskite films  large grain sizes help reduce the number of grain boundaries to suppress the charge trapping  PL and TRPL have been widely used to study the charge carrier kinetics of perovskite films deposited using conventional RT-casting and a hot-casting technique  As shown in Fig  6a  b  the PL intensity and carrier lifetime of the hot-cast perovskite film are much higher than that of the RT-cast film  indicating a significant decrease in the nonradiative recombination rate in the hot-cast CsPbI2Br film  Figure 6c depicts the calculated density of state ( DOS ) from the impedance spectroscopy for 1- and 48-h aged devices  respectively  Both DOS values fluctuate at approximately 17 × 1017 cm−3  The 48-h aging device tends to make trap state peaks toward lower frequencies  indicative of shallow trap energy and low-frequency dielectric loss related to the reduced grain boundaries in the perovskite film  Figure 6d shows the dependence of the measured Voc as a function of incident light intensity for a large-grain device ( 180 °C ) and a small-grain device ( 100 °C )  The linear-fitting slope of the small-grain device was 164 kBT/q  which was significantly higher than that of a large-grain device ( 102 kBT/q )  This difference indicates a more severe trap-assisted recombination in the device with smaller grain size  Meanwhile  hot-casted devices have higher rectification coefficients and less leakage current in the dark current curves ( Fig  6e )  which means smaller recombination compared to the RT-casted device  Figure 6f shows the J–V characteristics of hole-only devices with an ITO/NiOx/perovskite/PTAA/MoO3/Ag configuration to estimate the hole mobility and defect density of perovskite films deposited at different temperatures  The defect densities of devices fabricated at 70 and 25 °C were derived as 100 × 1015 cm−3 and 750 × 1015 cm−3  respectively  This was mainly due to the increase in grain size and the boundary reduction of devices deposited at 70 °C  Fig  6 figure 6 a  b PL and TRPL spectra of CsPbI2Br films fabricated using RT and hot casting [ 88 ]  Copyright © 2019 The

and Stability 331 Device Performance The PCE  stability  and cost are three main limiting factors for the practical application of PSCs  Table 1 summarizes the recent advances of PCEs when using a hot-casting technique  MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 are the two dominant light harvesters in PSCs  with energy bandgaps of 155 and 147 eV and a theoretical maximum PCE of 313 % and 325 %  respectively [ 89  90 ]  Nie et al  first reported the fabrication of a millimeter grain size of perovskite films  enabling a PCE of 1748 % with negligible hysteresis [ 19 ]  Marks et al  reported a hot-casting process to control the Cl− incorporation and achieved a PCE of 182 % for a small area ( 009 cm2 ) and 154 % for a large area ( 1 cm2 ) [ 11 ]  Chen et al  reported the deposition of an 850-nm-thick perovskite film together with a PCE of up to 1954 % [ 53 ]  Tsai et al  reported a 1252 % PCE without hysteresis based on BA2MA3Pb4I13 2D perovskite [ 91 ]  We believe that the PCE of PSCs using a hot-casting technology can catch up to that using a solution method in the future  Meanwhile  the improvement in the long-term stability for PSCs is closely related to the perovskite composition [ 17  24  92 ]  device structure [ 93 ]  and encapsulation [ 11 ]  Table 1 Summary of photovoltaic parameters for PSCs with hot-casting technique Full size table 332 Stability During the film deposition  device testing and storage  both water and oxygen directly affect the PSC performance and stability [ 102103104 ]  Taking MAPbI3 as an example  first  water vapor can dissolve the perovskite material ( 3 )  and MAI is then decomposed to form a mixture of MA and HI ( 4 ) ; however  HI will either react with O2 to form H2O and I2 ( 5 )  or self-decompose ( 6 )  In general  MAPbI3 continues to decompose after exposure to moisture  $ $ { text { CH } } _ { 3 } { text { NH } } _ { 3 } { text { PbI } } _ { 3 } ( { text { s ) } } mathop leftrightarrow limits^ { { { text { H } } _ { 2 } { text { O } } } }

increasing the crystalline quality is key in improving long-term stability  In this regard  long-chain organic cations ( +NH3-R-NH3+ or R-NH3+ ) have been widely introduced as a substitute to a site cations  These 2D perovskites exhibit excellent long-term stability [ 62  91 ]  in which the organic layer and the inorganic layer alternately form a layered structure  The larger organic cations in the 2D perovskite crystal structure improve the humidity stability owing to the hydrophobic nature of long-chain organic cations  Pure 2D PSCs exhibit good stability but low PCE [ 17  23 ]  Interestingly  excellent optoelectronic properties and stability can be achieved by combining 3D perovskite and 2D Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite [ 105  106 ]  To successfully achieve this 3D/2D structure  it is necessary to control the growth direction allowing the carriers to be transported across the plane ; otherwise  the transmission of photogenerated charge carriers will be inhibited by the long organic chain  Perovskite films grown perpendicular to the substrate direction can be obtained using hot-casting techniques  This allows the device to achieve an excellent carrier transportability and high PCE ( Fig  7a  b )  Kanatzidis et al  conducted stability tests for BA2MA4Pb5I16 films in ambient air ( RH ≈ 30 % )  A BA2MA4Pb5I16 film exhibits excellent environmental stability [ 17 ]  The 2D perovskite deposited using a hot-casting technique can maintain its inherent performance for a long timeframe  indicating superior stability under humid and other environmental conditions [ 18 ]  Figure 7c schematically illustrates that a hot substrate can promote a rapid transition from a disordered precursor solution to a perovskite phase without the growth of an intermediate phase  thereby obtaining a low-dimensional perovskite film with a vertical orientation and a high phase purity [ 87 ]  The carrier transport dynamics of 2D perovskites have been recognized to be related to the differences in the crystal orientation  Liang et al  used time-resolved terahertz ( THz ) spectroscopy ( TRTS ) to measure the photoconductivity kinetics of n-BA and iso-BA-based 2D perovskites from the transient charge carrier mobility ( Δµ )  in-plane mobility ( µi )  and out-of-plane mobility ( µo )  A THz probe beam is perpendicular to the ( n-BA ) 2 ( MA ) 3Pb4I13 and ( iso-BA ) 2 ( MA ) 3Pb4I13 films ( Fig  7d )  The measured carrier mobilities were 188 and 038 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 2 ps  respectively  The value of µo of ( iso-BA ) 2 ( MA ) 3Pb4I13 ( 135 cm2 V−1 s−1 ) was much higher than that of ( n-BA ) 2 ( MA ) 3Pb4I13  The ( iso-BA ) 2 ( MA ) 3Pb4I13 perovskite film exhibits a strong crystalline orientation  which increases charge mobility [ 18 ]  Fig  7 figure 7 Schematic illustration of perovskite crystal structures : a ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) 3Pb4I13 and ( BA ) 2 ( MA ) 3Pb4I13 ; b ( iso-BA ) 2 ( MA ) 3Pb4I13  Copyright © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co

All inorganic perovskites are also a promising choice for improving the long-term stability  which have better thermal stability owing to the presence of an inorganic cation with a higher thermal decomposition temperature  Zheng et al  adopted hot casting to deposit an inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite film at low temperatures [ 88 ]  The phase transition temperature of CsPbI2Br was reduced to 120 °C  and a dense and pinhole-free CsPbI2Br perovskite film with a large grain size was formed  An ultrahigh substrate temperature is not necessary for the hot-casting process  Zhao et al  evaluated the thermodynamic stability of the materials through DFT calculations [ 107 ]  The positive decomposition enthalpy (  ( Delta H_ { text { dec } }  ) ) of CsPbBr3 indicates high thermodynamic stability  This is different from that of CsPbI3  CsPbI2Br  and CsPbBr2I with a negative  ( Delta H_ { text { dec } }  )  Song et al  deposited a uniform large-area cesium-based 2D perovskite thin film using hot-casting technology  Compared with an RT-casting film  a hot-casting film has a higher PL strength and longer carrier life [ 108 ]  Mathews et al  deposited silver bismuth iodide ( AgBiI4 and Ag2BiI5 ) through dynamic hot casting under an ambient atmosphere [ 92 ]  The hot-casting technique facilitates the deposition of a needle-free uniform film with a large grain size by increasing the solubility of AgI  34 Upscaling Deposition As a solution-processable photovoltaic technology  hot casting is mostly applied to small area devices ( < 1 cm2 ) in the laboratory  Based on the rapid development and advantages of hot-casting technology  integration with other scalable deposition technologies is a promising way to achieve upscaled manufacturing of PSCs  The basic idea of hot-casting technology is to stabilize the temperature of the substrate and precursor solution concurrently  thereby affecting the nucleation rate and film morphology through a rapid supersaturation of the precursor solution  Coincidentally  the substrate temperature has been reported to have an important effect on the film morphology in blade coating  spray coating  and inkjet printing  Figure 8a schematically illustrates the blade coating deposition on a hot substrate [ 96  109110111 ]  Huang et al  introduced a small amount of Cs+ cations and Br− anions into the perovskite precursor solution to obtain a MA06FA038Cs002PbI2975Br0025 film and improve the phase purity [ 96 ]  The rapid film-forming process of the hot-casting technique may be effective in suppressing the “ solution flow ” during the dry film stage  Bénard–Marangoni convection caused by the thermal gradient can not be ignored in a CsPbI2Br fluid  which will pull the accumulated solutes in an area with the highest surface tension and inhibit the formation of a continuous film ( Fig  8b ) [ 107 ]  At the optimal processing temperature of 80 °C  a large-area  high-crystallinity  uniform  and pinhole-free CsPbI2Br film can be obtained  The slow solvent removal and the presence of intermediate phases during the thermal annealing result in poor film coverage and low crystalline quality of the RT-casted film  The hot casting at 150 °C induces a direct crystal growth  which allows the formation of a compact  pinhole-free  and uniform film ( Fig  8c ) [ 97 ]  Fig  8 figure 8 a Scheme of the doctor-blade coating method [ 96 ]  Copyright © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA  Weinheim  b Schematic illustration of the Bénard–Marangoni convection and depletion-assisted flow of CsPbI2Br fluid at higher and lower

during thermal annealing [ 97 ]  Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc Full size image Spray coating and inkjet printing have also been applied to accelerate the evaporation of solvent molecules by increasing the substrate temperature and finally obtain a uniform and dense perovskite film  Meanwhile  slot-die deposition [ 112 ]  spray coating [ 65  95 ]  and inkjet printing are low-cost  high-throughput  and substrate-compatible deposition thin-film technologies ( Fig  9a–c )  Perovskite crystal grains can grow into larger crystals through re-dissolution  grain-merging  and re-crystallization  The balance of an inward flux ( Fin ) and an outward flux ( Fout ) can be controlled through deposition parameters such as the solution concentration  solvent mixture  and substrate temperature ( Fig  9d ) [ 95 ]  Owing to the high sensitivity of perovskite materials in the atmospheric environment  the development of these technologies has been limited  When integrated with hot-casting technology  the sensitivity of the perovskite materials can be improved through the rapid film formation and introduction of all-inorganic components and long alkyl amine chains  Fig  9 figure 9 Common scalable

and Prospects The quality of a perovskite film is a key factor in determining the ultimate performance of PSCs  Hot-casting technology shows excellent device performance and commercialization prospects in the deposition of high-quality perovskite films  The current research status of this technology was comprehensively summarized and discussed in this review  Based on the classical LaMer model  the effects of various depositing parameters on different stages of nucleation and growth of perovskite films were analyzed  The results show that the adjustment of the film formation parameters such as the substrate temperature  thermal annealing  precursor chemistry  and experimental environment can improve the nucleation and crystallization of perovskite  as well as obtain a higher-quality perovskite film and PSCs with superior performance  In addition  the review highlighted the advantages of hot-casting techniques for the deposition of perovskite films  such as large grain sizes  insensitive thicknesses  and preferred orientations of low-dimensional perovskites  From the perspective of stability  the application of hot-casting technology in inorganic  lead-free  and low-dimensional perovskite films was also summarized  Finally  the prospects of an upscaling of hot-casting technology or integration with other scalable deposition technologies were discussed  However  there are still some remaining questions about this promising technology that has yet to be fully answered  For example  the chemical reaction of the precursors and the crystallization kinetics process has not been fully disclosed  The interface mechanism of a hot-cast film in contact with a functional layer has not been clearly explained  and the PCE of a device prepared using a hot-casting technique is still lower than that from a conventional solution deposition  The mechanism of water invasion toward hot-cast perovskite surfaces and related stability issues has not been reported in detail in the literature  According to the particular film-forming process and film properties of the hot-casting technology  the following issues should be taken into consideration for the maturity of this technology : The concurrent solvent evaporation and perovskite crystallization over an extremely short period of time ( approximately 3–5 s ) makes the control of the crystallization a challenge  Adjusting the solvent composition  additives  and solvent engineering will play a role in the proper control of the crystallization  In addition  from a more microscopic perspective  the temperature distribution around the crystal nucleus  grain boundaries  and unit cells during nucleation growth should be analyzed  The mechanism of thermal energy at each stage and the effect of the release of residual thermal energy on the film should be interpreted from a thermodynamic perspective  The integration of a hot-casting technology with other scalable deposition technologies ( such as blade coating  spray coating  inkjet printing  screen printing  and slot-die deposition ) in the deposition of high-quality perovskite films with a large area  high throughput  and low cost should be highly desirable for future industrial application of this promising technique  Moreover  hot-casting technology has extremely broad prospects in the growth of low-dimensional perovskite films  inorganic perovskite films  and single-crystal growth  In addition  hot-casting technology can be used as an early exploration tool for new materials and structures  This is of great significance for the rapid screening of early research directions  Owing to the rapid and controlled crystallization and short film-forming process  we look forward to wide implementation of a hot-casting technique applied to the upscaling deposition of perovskite films and related optoelectronic devices in the near futureFlawless coverage of a perovskite layer is essential in order to achieve realistic high-performance planar heterojunction solar cells  We present that high-quality perovskite layers can be efficiently formed by a novel hot casting route combined with MAI ( CH3NH3I ) and non-halide lead acetate ( PbAc2 ) precursors under ambient atmosphere  Casting temperature is controlled to produce various perovskite microstructures and the resulted crystalline layers are found to be comprised of closely packed islands with a smooth surface structure  Lead acetate employed perovskite solar cells are fabricated using PEDOT : PSS and PCBM charge transporting layers  in p–i–n type planar architecture  Especially  the outstanding open-circuit voltage demonstrates the high crystallinity and dense coverage of the produced perovskite layers by this facile route

Methylammonium Bismuth Iodide Layers Article 10 July 2018 1 Introduction Perovskite-based hybrid solar cells have gained enormous attention as a promising candidate for next generation solar cells  with their continuously increasing power-conversion efficiency  which is comparable to conventional silicon solar cells [ 12345678 ]  Particularly  recent studies have been mainly focused on simple planar structured solar cells  based on the perovskite absorber ’ s unique characteristics such as high carrier mobility and ambipolar transport  and also the processing development enabling full coverage perovskite films [ 9  10 ]  Fabricating high-quality perovskite with a controlled morphology is indispensable for high-efficiency planar solar cells  Therefore various methods have been employed based on one-step or sequential approaches including two-step solution-based deposition  anti-solvent dripping  solvent-vapor annealing and vacuum-based deposition  etc  [ 1112131415161718192021 ]  However  most of these methods involve additional steps or equipments causing cost  time and reliability concerns  Hence  finding an efficient route producing full coverage and high quality perovskite films is needful  On the other hand  it has been reported that lead acetate ( PbAc2 ) sources can result in faster perovskite formation with smoother surface roughness compared to conventional lead-halide counterparts  via the facile removal of by-product gas and thereby the acceleration of crystal growth [ 222324252627282930313233 ]  Furthermore  a stringently controlled dry environment is generally required for high-quality perovskite layer synthesis since ambient moisture can lead to inactive PbI2 formation and poor coverage [ 34 ]  Here  we report an efficient perovskite-fabrication route employing hot casting in conjunction with MAI and non-halide PbAc2 precursors under ambient atmosphere  Fully covered  pinhole-free perovskite layers with high crystallinity were formed even without post-annealing  Besides  the relatively smooth surface roughness of a root-mean-square ( RMS ) of ~ 24 nm was obtained by the optimization of casting temperature  despite rapid crystallization  Inverted planar heterojunction solar cells were successfully fabricated  showing the best cell efficiency of 82 %  Especially  the outstanding open-circuit voltage ( Voc ) of 098 V was confirmed  demonstrating the high crystallinity and dense coverage of the perovskite thin films fabricated through this route  2 Experimental Procedure Indium tin oxide ( ITO ) coated glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication sequentially in acetone  isopropanol  and deionized water  then exposed to ultraviolet-ozone to improve wettability  As a hole transporting material  poly ( 34-ethylenedioxythiophene ) polystyrene sulfonate ( PEDOT : PSS ) was deposited by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 40 s afterward heat-treated at 140 °C for 15 min in ambient air [ 35 ]  Perovskite precursors were prepared to a concentration of ~ 33 wt % by dissolving MAI and PbAc2 with a 3:1 molar ratio in anhydrous n  n-dimethylformamide ( DMF )  and filtrated with 045 μm polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) filters before spin casting  The PEDOT : PSS-coated substrates were preheated on a hot plate  and the top surface temperature was monitored and stabilized by the help of an IR-thermal gun  Following the fast transfer of the aforementioned substrates  the perovskite precursors were immediately spin-casted at 4000 rpm for 10 s  under ambient atmosphere  For electron-transporting layers  the solutions of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) with a concentration of 16 mg/ml in chlorobenzene were deposited at 1000 rpm for 60 s at room temperature in ambient air  As a buffer layer  29-dimdimeth-47-diphenyl-110-phenanthroline ( BCP ) was dissolved in isopropanol and spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s [ 36 ]  Finally  the devices were completed by thermal evaporation of 200 nm thick Ag electrodes  X-ray diffraction analyses ( XRD  Ultima IV : RIGAKU ) were used to ascertain the crystal structure of the produced perovskite layers  The morphology and surface topography were investigated by a field-emission scanning electron microscopy ( FE-SEM  S-4300 : HITACHI ) and an atomic force microscopy ( AFM  XE-150 : Park System )  respectively  The optical absorbance spectra were obtained by a UV–Vis spectrophotometer ( UV-1601PC : Shimadzu )  The photocurrent density–voltage ( J–V ) characteristics of the devices were recorded from the reverse scan at a scan rate of 001 V/s by using a solar simulator ( 94021A : Newport )  During the measurements  the solar cell devices were masked with an aperture area of 009 cm2 to avoid the edge effects  3 Results and Discussion Fully covered  pinhole-free perovskite layers are produced by a novel hot casting route  combined with non-halide PbAc2 precursors under ambient atmosphere  It is known that acetate sources can accelerate perovskite crystal formation due to the facile removal of MAAc by-product thereby resulting in high-quality  uniform and smooth layers compared to halide-based ones [ 22  25 ]  Figure 1 represents the schematic illustration of the protocol  producing compact and high crystallinity perovskite layers even without post-annealing treatment under ambient air  First  PEDOT : PSS-coated substrates are preheated above the boiling point ( ~ 153 °C ) of DMF solvent  Provided the fast transfer of the heated substrates to the spin coater  a mixture of MAI and PbAc2 ( with a molar ratio of 3:1 ) is instantaneously dropped and spun cast under ambient atmosphere  As soon as the precursor mixture falls onto the substrates  the solutions transform into dark brown films indicating that evaporation of MAAc gas begins and direct crystallization occurs during the spinning  This accelerated crystal growth results in an efficient formation of well-defined highly crystalline perovskite layers without further heat treatment  Fig  1 figure 1 Processing scheme for crystalline perovskite layers  through hot casting under ambient atmosphere  Substrates are preheated above the boiling point of DMF solvent  and then MAI and PbAc2 precursors are spin-coated on the substrates  leading to compact and high crystallinity perovskite layers without further annealing treatment Full size image The produced perovskite layers ’ crystal structure and composition were investigated according to casting temperatures  as shown in Fig  2a  All the samples exhibit strong diffraction peaks corresponding to ( 110 ) and ( 002 ) planes  without any second phase  Furthermore  little change in texture is found within the casting temperature range  indicating the production of the highly crystalline layers that does not require subsequent heat treatment  The final composition resulted from the reactants can be extracted from the following balanced chemical equation [ 22 ] : 3 { text { MAI } } + { text { PbAc } } _ { 2 } to { text { MAPbI } } _ { 3 } +   2 { text { MAAc } }  Ideally  the reactants form the solid phases of MAPbI3 via the release of acetate-involved gas without other solid phases  which well explains the diffraction spectra of the final films by this route  The optical absorption spectra of the perovskite films are shown in Fig  2b  and optical bandgaps were estimated from the Tauc plots with linear fits near the band edges  The values for all the samples were similar to ~ 155 eV  which is in agreement with previous reports  confirming the successful formation of MAPbI3  Fig  2 figure 2 a X-ray diffraction patterns of the perovskite thin films  Casting temperature : 140 °C ( bottom ) to 200 °C ( top ) with the interval of 20 °C  b Optical absorption spectra ( inset ) and corresponding Tauc plots with linear fits near band edges Full size image Figure 3 shows the SEM results of the perovskite layers deposited at different casting temperatures  From the plan-view images  complete coverage with island-shaped perovskite formation is clearly confirmed ( Fig  3a )  The size of the islands is found to get larger with increasing casting temperature  The size distributions of the islands were extracted and analyzed from the SEM images by the Gaussian fits of the histograms and the average sizes were estimated to ~ 49  ~ 84  and ~ 116 μm for the casting temperatures of 170  180  and 190 °C  respectively  ( Fig  3b )  The formation of the large islands would be responsible for rapid growth from a few nucleation sites under the effect of thermal energy [ 37 ]  From the cross-sectional images  the distinct and densely grown morphology of the perovskite layers on the hole-transporting layers is clearly presented ( Fig  3c )  The small internal grains composed the islands are clearly distinguished  and the average grain sizes exhibit the slight increase from ~ 80 to ~ 100 nm when the casting temperature increases from 170 to 190 °C  The average thickness also slightly increases from ~ 330 to ~ 380 nm with the casting temperature  due to the small difference in crystallization speed against the spillover of the solutions by spinning  Further increase of casting temperature to 200 °C caused a significant change in the average thickness to ~ 500 nm and the perovskite surface became very rough ( The data are not shown here )  Fig  3 figure 3 SEM analyses of the perovskite thin films  a Plan-view images with various casting temperatures  b Island-size distributions with Gaussian fits  c Cross-sectional SEM image  Casting temperature : 180 °C Full size image Perovskite layers are desired to have flat surfaces in order to reduce subsequent charge-transporting layer thickness  hence leading to lower resistance and improved device performance  The AFM-analysis results of the perovskite films are presented in Fig  4  The RMS-roughness values were calculated to ~ 303  ~ 249  and ~ 348 nm for 170  180  and 190 °C  respectively  in the areas of 20 × 20 µm2  The line and height profiles also point out that the perovskite film produced at 180 °C has the smoothest surface  Fig  4 figure 4 Surface-roughness analyses of the perovskite thin films  a AFM images with various casting temperatures  b Representative line profiles  c Height distributions around average heights Full size image The fabricated inverted-type planar device architecture is shown in Fig  5a  PEDOT : PSS  PCBM and BCP were used as hole-transporting  electron-transporting and buffer layers  respectively  Table 1 summarizes the photovoltaic performances of the devices produced with different perovskite-casting temperatures  and the representative J–V curves are also plotted in Fig  5b  The best efficiency of 82 % is confirmed at 180 °C  which is due to the optimized perovskite microstructure such as surface roughness and crystallinity  Especially  the outstanding Voc of 098 V affirms the high crystallinity and dense coverage of the perovskite layers produced by this facile and efficient route  Despite of the process merit  the nonuniform perovskite thickness due to the island structure can cause severe recombination problems at the interface with the subsequent PCBM layer  which would be the main reason for the relatively low short-circuit current ( Jsc ) and fill factor ( FF )  Fig  5 figure 5 a Device structure  b Representative J–V curves with various casting temperatures Full size image Table 1 Photovoltaic performances of the perovskite solar cell devices with different casting temperatures Full size table 4 Conclusions We have fabricated the MAPbI3 perovskite films through a novel hot casting technique combined with MAI and non-halide PbAc2 sources  under ambient atmosphere  The X-ray diffraction and optical absorption analyses confirmed the formation of the high crystallinity MAPbI3 with a band gap of ~ 155 eV  even without post-annealing  The pinhole-free dense perovskite layers composed of the completely packed islands were verified  and the small internal grains inside the islands were also observed  Furthermore  the relatively smooth surface with the RMS roughness of ~ 24 nm was observed  The inverted type planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells were demonstrated using PEDOT : PSS and PCBM/BCP  showing the best efficiency of 82 % with the high Voc of 098 V As a future work  it is necessary to further develop perovskite-layer quality with optimizing device structure to improve the efficiency while maintaining the benefits of the synthetic routedFe05Cr05O3 compound was synthesized through solid-state reaction route  based on stoichiometric mixture of Fe2O3  Cr2O3 and Gd2O3  The X-ray diffraction data showed that GdFe05Cr05O3 crystallizes in an orthorhombic distorted perovskite structure  High-resolution electron microscopy showed a well-ordered material and confirms the orthorhombic perovskite symmetry  Magnetic susceptibility data reveal a Curie-Weiss behavior in the temperature range 250 − 340 K and the onset of antiferromagnetic interactions with a Neel temperature of 241 K Similar content being

orthochromites RECrO3 are of great interest due to their potential applications such as sensors  heterogeneous catalysts  magnetic  ferroelectric information storage  magnetic refrigeration  microwaves  and radio frequencies [ 1234 ]  The RECrO3 ( RE = La  Nd  Ho  Er  Yb  Lu ) compounds exhibit canted antiferromagnetic ( C-AFM ) and ferroelectric behaviors providing a new family of multiferroics [ 5 ]  Rare-earth orthoferrites REFeO3 ( RE = La  Nd  Gd  Ho  Er ) are isostructural to RECrO3 with antiferromagnetic ordering of Fe3+ ions well above room temperature [ 6 ]  The orthochromite GdCrO3 crystallizes in an distorted orthorhombic-perovskite structure with cell parameters a = 53142 Å  b = 55239 Å  and c = 76063 Å [ 7 ]  Jaiswal et al  [ 8 ] reported that the magnetic properties of GdCrO3 nanoparticles are influenced by the competition between Cr3+–O–Cr3+ ( AF )  Cr3+–O–Gd3+ ( F )  and Gd3+–O–Gd3+ ( AF ) superexchange interactions giving rise to an antiferromagnetic ordering superimposed to a weak ferromagnetic ordering due to the onset of ferromagnetic Cr3+–O–Gd3+ interactions  The Neel temperature for the antiferromagnetic transition is estimated to be 167 K Moreover  GdCrO3 nanoparticles show a negative magnetization below 95 K due to Cr3+–Gd3+ interactions [ 8 ]  The centrosymmetric rare-earth orthoferrite GdFeO3 crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure with cell parameters a = 5349 Å  b = 5610 Å  and c = 7667 Å [ 9 ]  In GdFeO3  Fe spins order antiferromagnetically at the Neel temperature TN = 661 K with a weak ferromagnetic moment due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction [ 10 ]  Ferroelectric behavior and canted antiferromagnetism in this perovskite are demonstrated by the existence of both polarization–electric field ( P–E ) and magnetization–magnetic field ( M–H ) loops [ 11 ]  The magneto-electric coefficient of GdFeO3 was found to be 178 mV cm−1 Oe−1 [ 11 ]  Due to their interesting properties  the rare-earth perovskites with a Fe/Cr = 1:1 composition at the B-site have attracted much attention in the last few years [ 12131415 ]  The ferroelectric behavior of the multiferroic system GdFe1-xCrxO3 ( 01 ≤ x ≤ 09 ) was highlighted since the observation of large spontaneous polarization at room temperature and ferroelectric hysteresis loop [ 16 ]  Magnetically  the perovskites GdFe1-xCrxO3 ( 01 ≤ x ≤ 09 ) show the coexistence of canted antiferromagnetism induced by double exchange effect of Fe–O–Fe and Cr–O–Cr and ferromagnetism due to superexchange interactions of Fe–O–Cr [ 16 ]  A giant magneto-caloric effect was also reported for GdFe05Cr05O3 with a magnetic entropy change reaching 292 J kg−1 K−1 [ 17 ]  In this paper  we report a study on the synthesis  structural  and magnetic properties of GdFe05Cr05O3 perovskite  2 Experimental The GdFe05Cr05O3 sample was prepared via SSR route  Powders of Gd2O3  Fe2O3  and Cr2O3  in the molar ratio of stoichiometry 1:05:05  were stoichiometrically mixed in an agate mortar in the presence of ethanol and sintered at 1200 °C for 24 h Powder volume is defined as the volume that a powder occupied after it is dissolved or dispersed in a liquid  The addition of the small amount of ethanol to the mixture ( a few small drops ) was not intended to dissolve the raw materials  but to improve the homogeneity of the mixture and evaporated during grinding  For this reason  the volume ratio of the mixture was not taken into consideration when preparing the samples  The crystalline structure was investigated using X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) technique at room temperature with a Siemens D500 diffractometer in a wide range of Bragg angles ( 10 ° ≤ 2θ ≤ 60° ) using Cu Kα ( λ = 154056 Å ) radiation  High-resolution electron microscopy ( HREM ) was performed on a JEOL 3000 FEG electron microscope  fitted with a double tilting goniometer stage ( ± 20°  ± 20° )  Magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed using a Quantum Design ( MPMS5S ) magnetometer in an applied magnetic field of 500 Oe over the temperature range 2–350 K The susceptibility measurements were performed upon heating the sample to 350 K under applied field of 500 Oe after zero field cooling at 2 K ( ZFC-measurement )  Field cooling ( FC ) magnetic susceptibility was measured after cooling the sample from 350 to 2 K at 500 Oe  3 Results and Discussion The precursors Cr2O3  Fe2O3  and Gd2O3 were crystallized in trigonal  rhombohedral  and cubic or monoclinic systems  respectively  XRD pattern analysis revealed that all diffraction peaks obtained correspond to a Pbnm orthorhombic system as revealed by the JCPDS cards database and affirmed by previous investigation on GdFe05Cr05O3 system ( Fig  1 )  The lattice parameters were found to be a = 53323 Å  b = 55643 Å  and c = 76299 Å  Fig  1 figure 1 XRD pattern of GdFe05Cr05O3 powder Full size image The cationic composition  determined on several small crystallites by energy dispersive X-ray analysis in the electron microscope  accords with the nominal one ( GdFe05Cr05O3 )  The most relevant images are shown in Fig  2a  b  respectively  The HREM micrograph along [ 001 ] ( Fig  2a ) ( [ 010 ] in the legend ) shows an apparently well-ordered material with d-spacings of 54 Å and 77 Å  corresponding to d100 and d001  Fourier transform was performed on the HREM micrograph  in order to verify the existence of different domains that could evidence the presence of additional ordering of the structure ( cationic or anionic )  However  the whole crystal results are homogeneous and only the maxima corresponding to the orthorhombic perovskite were observed ( insert Fig  2a )  Concerning the observed contrast  one can say that it consists on bright dots alternating with a brightest ones  which may be linked to the Gd atoms that alternate with Fe/Cr ones along [ 100 ] and [ 001 ] directions  Fig  2 figure 2 HREM micrograph corresponding to GdFe05Cr05O3  a Along [ 010 ]  b Along [ − 110 ]  The inset shows Fourier transform performed on the HREM micrograph Full size image The HREM micrograph along  ( left [ overline { 1 } 10right ]  ) ( Fig  2b [ 110 ] in the image ) shows well-ordered material with d-spacings of 38 Å and 77 Å corresponding to d110 and d001 confirming the orthorhombic perovskite symmetry  Fourier transform was performed on the HREM  but no additional ordering was observed  According to that  the structural model for GdFe05Cr05O3 results in a Pbnm orthorhombic perovskite structure  Temperature dependence of the zero-field-cooled ( ZFC ) and field-cooled ( FC ) magnetic susceptibility is shown in Fig  3  Fig  3 figure 3 Temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of GdCrFeO3  Red circles are the ZCF susceptibility data  and black are the FC susceptibility data  The inset is the χ−1 vs T plot Full size image The susceptibility obeys to a Curie-Weiss law in the temperature range 250–350 K  and the effective magnetic moment was determined to be 1280 μB  which agrees well with the theoretical one expected for Gd3+  Cr3+  and Fe3+ paramagnetic cations 1316 μB  The Weiss constant takes a negative value of − 300 K indicating that the predominant interactions should be antiferromagnetic  The anomaly showed in the χ versus T plot and better visualized in the χ−1 vs T plot inset in Fig  3 indicates the presence of the antiferromagnetic interactions with a Neel temperature of 241 K The small increasing in the magnetic susceptibility found at this ordering temperature can be assigned to a weak ferromagnetic component due to the antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in accordance with the previous results found in the analogous GdFeO3 and GdCrO3 derivatives where the magnetic structures that present have been described by G-type antiferromagnetic order  In the present study  these antiferromagnetic interactions are the result of the superexchange Cr ( d3 ) –O–Fe ( d5 ) interactions  The presence of two different cations namely Cr3+ and Fe3+  which are disordered in the perovskite structure  fully justify that the TN takes the value of 241 K In this sense  it is worth noting that in the case of the GdFeO3  the TN value is 643 K  because the superexchange interaction involved Fe3+ cations where the spin value is 5/2  while the lower value of 171 K obtained for the isostructural GdCrO3 where the Cr+3 are the cations involved in the superexchange  Below TN ( 241 K )  an increasing divergence between the ZFC and FC magnetic susceptibility increases by lowering the temperature due to the mentioned ferromagnetic component arising from the DM component which is strongly masked by the strong paramagnetic contribution of Gd3+ which remains non-ordered down to 2 K 4 Conclusion GdFe05Cr05O3 simple perovskite was prepared by a conventional SSR route  A well-ordered material is observed by HRTEM and confirms the X-ray diffraction results which showed that GdFe05Cr05O3 crystallizes in an orthorhombic distorted perovskite structure  Magnetic susceptibility data reveal a Curie-Weiss behavior in the temperature range 250–340 K and the onset of antiferromagnetic interactions  Skip to main content SpringerLink Log in Find a journal Publish with us Track your research Search Cart Home Science China Materials Article High-efficiency colorful

applications including building integrated photovoltaics and wearable electronics  However  it remains challenging to prepare high-efficiency PSCs with attractive colors using perovskites with broad optical absorption and large absorption coefficients  Here we show that high-efficiency PSCs exhibiting distinct structural colors can be readily fabricated by employing TiO2 nanobowl ( NB ) arrays as a nanostructured electron transport layer to integrate with a thin overlayer of perovskite on the NB arrays  A new crystalline precursor film based on lead acetate was prepared through a Lewis acid-base adduct approach  which allowed for the formation of a uniform overlayer of high-quality CH3NH3PbI3 crystals on the inner walls of the NBs  The PSCs fabricated using the TiO2 NB arrays showed angle-dependent vivid colors under light illumination  The resultant colorful PSCs exhibited a remarkable photovoltaic performance with a champion efficiency up to 1694 % and an average efficiency of 1547 %  which are record-breaking among the reported colorful PSCs  摘要 钙钛矿太阳能电池飞速发展及其在构筑一体化和可穿戴 器件中应用前景激发人们对于彩色钙钛矿太阳能电池浓厚 兴趣  但如何将可见光宽波段吸收且具有高吸光系数钙钛矿材 料构筑成高性能彩色太阳能电池仍是一个挑战  本文利用TiO2 纳米碗阵列作为结构化电子传输层

PSCs ) has stimulated great interest in the fabrication of colorful PSCs to meet the needs of aesthetic purposes in varied applications including building integrated photovoltaics and wearable electronics  However  it remains challenging to prepare high-efficiency PSCs with attractive colors using perovskites with broad optical absorption and large absorption coefficients  Here we show that high-efficiency PSCs exhibiting distinct structural colors can be readily fabricated by employing TiO2 nanobowl ( NB ) arrays as a nanostructured electron transport layer to integrate with a thin overlayer of perovskite on the NB arrays  A new crystalline precursor film based on lead acetate was prepared through a Lewis acid-base adduct approach  which allowed for the formation of a uniform overlayer of high-quality CH3NH3PbI3 crystals on the inner walls of the NBs  The PSCs fabricated using the TiO2 NB arrays showed angle-dependent vivid colors under light illumination  The resultant colorful PSCs exhibited a remarkable photovoltaic performance with a champion efficiency up to 1694 % and an average efficiency of 1547 %  which are record-breaking among the reported colorful PSCs

three different approaches to model the conductivity variation in perovskite films at elevated temperature  prolonged irradiation levels and strain induced in the lattice  The conductivity variation under any of these stressing conditions can represent ion migration across the perovskite layer because the conductivity is related to mobility and carrier densities  Ion migration can elevate the density of electrons/holes across the film if the stress condition reduce/lift the activation energy at the interface of the film and smoothens the ion passivation to the perovskite layer  In addition  the conductivity of the film is related to device metrics ( eg  fill factor ) and also to materials properties ( eg  mobility and bandgap ) and  therefore  it can be a significant measure of stress impact on device stability  For example  the conductivity falls under stress which represents the ion migration enhancement  In our modeling  we have shown that the conductivity is inversely related to temperature and strain ( σ ∝ 1/kT  σ ∝ 1/ε ) but is directly related to irradiation level ( σ ∝ ξ1/2 )  We have fitted our modeling to experimental data reported in the literature and extracted the activation energy of ion migration mechanism under every stress condition  The band diagrams of the mechanism are presented and it is shown that stress can foster the ion migration by reducing the activation energy at the interfaces of the perovskite layer  However  the impact of heating is worse on film conductivity  whereas irradiation and strain have a moderate or slight effect on it  respectively  Our findings may provide a practical solution to obtain a measure of ion migration in perovskite solar cells for aging analysis of the cell stability and recovery rates under different stressing conditions  Article PDF Similar content being viewed by others Numerical modelling of ion-migration caused hysteresis in perovskite solar cells Article 16 March 2021 Influences of dielectric

perovskite materials  In this method  initially the metal halide film is coated  over which the MAI with a particular concentration is again spin-coated  However  it is difficult to obtain complete conversion of PbI2 in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite  In this work  we show that good quality perovskite films can be coated by a three-step method to obtain improved conversion to perovskite and with improved materials properties  We have coated the perovskite films by two-step as well as three-step methods and presented a comparison of obtained film properties  Our results show that at lower concentration of MAI  complete conversion of PbI2 does not take place  With increase in MAI concentration  in addition to the perovskite phase an intercalated MAI into PbI2 phase is formed  In three-step coating  good phase of perovskite and improved morphology is obtained at comparatively lower MAI concentration  At higher concentrations of MAI in three-step method  leads to removal of already existing perovskite material and therefore leads to lower absorption  Similar content being viewed by others Influence of annealing on stability and regeneration of degraded CH3NH3PbI3 thin films Article 03

This has resulted in enhanced global energy dependence on fossil fuels  such as coal and petroleum  However  fossil fuels are not the permanent energy solution  and also it produces harmful effect on our environment due to toxic emissions [ 123 ]  Therefore  the scientific community is looking towards a suitable renewable energy source as a solution to future global energy needs  Among the renewable energy sources photovoltaic devices are one of the most promising alternatives  Due to high cost and energy intensive processes involved  well studied silicon technology is not being used widely [ 4 ]  Organic-inorganic metal halide perovskite materials are the front runners in the search for low cost  solution processable and efficient photovoltaic devices  This comparatively new class of materials possesses excellent electrical and optical properties [ 5 ]  These are solution processable  flexible in terms of composition and can be deposited on the flexible substrates [ 6 ]  They combine the best properties of both inorganic as well as of organic materials [ 7 ]  Starting with 38 % power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) in 2008  the perovskite solar cell performance has skyrocketed since then [ 8 ]  After a decade it has attained ~ 24 % PCE in recent years [ 9 ]  They also have applications in light emitting devices ( LEDs ) [ 10 ]  field effect transistors ( FETs ) [ 11 ]  lasers [ 12 ]  photo-detectors [ 13 ]  etc  Two-step sequential deposition techniques provide cost-effective and high performance route for the synthesis of these materials  In this method  metal halide film is initially spin-coated  Over this  methyl ammonium iodide ( MAI ) is either spin-coated or dip-coated [ 14 ]  However  it is difficult to obtain complete conversion of PbI2 in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite [ 15 ]  Also there is uncontrolled crystal growth and surface morphology [ 16 ]  Spin coating method has a significant role in the development of perovskite solar cells in a span of just a decade  Also commercialization by this method can not be ruled out completely  In this account  we show that good quality perovskite films can also be coated by a three-step method to obtain improved materials properties  We have coated the perovskite films by two-step as well as three-step methods and presented a comparison of obtained film properties  Our results show that at lower concentration of MAI  complete conversion of PbI2 does not take place  With increase in MAI concentration however intercalated MAI into PbI2 phase is formed in two-step method  In three-step coating  good phase of perovskite and improved morphology is obtained at comparatively lower MAI concentration  At higher concentrations of MAI in three-step method leads to removal of already formed perovskite after the second step and therefore leads to lower absorption  The concentration of MAI solution is therefore critical in the final film properties of the film  2 Experimental methods MAI synthesis was performed by drop-wise addition of 10 ml of hydro-iodic acid ( HI ) ( 57 wt % in water  sigma Aldrich ) in 24 ml of methyl amine ( 33 wt % in absolute ethanol  sigma Aldrich ) [ 17 ]  Reaction was allowed at 0°C for 2 h Precipitate was collected by drying the solution in rotary evaporator at 50°C  After collection of raw CH3NH3I  purification was performed by re-dissolving in 80 ml ethanol and again precipitated with the addition of 300 ml diethyl ether  The purification process was repeated twice and final CH3NH3I was collected after drying in vacuum oven at 60°C for 24 h Perovskite synthesis was performed using two-step and three-step sequential deposition spin coating methods  In two-step method  initially PbI2 ( 461 mg/ml in DMF ) layer was coated on glass substrate followed by thermal annealing at 100°C for 5 min  After cooling down the PbI2-coated substrates  MAI layer was spin-coated at 1000 rpm on it  followed by annealing at 100°C for 5 min  The concentration of MAI was varied as 10  20  30 and 40 mg/ml  while other parameters were kept constant  In three-step  we followed same methodology as in two-step  only an additional MAI layer deposition was performed followed by annealing at 100°C for 5 min  Schematic diagram of the two processes is shown Fig  1  Fig  1 figure 1 Schematic diagram showing the perovskite film deposition process by two and three-step methods Full size image To record the UV-Visible absorption spectra  spectrophotometer ( UV 1600 ) from Shimadzu was used  Morphology of the films were studied using scanning electron microscope ( S-4800 ) from Hitachi  X-ray diffractometer ( D8 advance Bruker ) with incident source wavelength λ = 154 Å in coupling mode was used to record the x-ray diffraction ( XRD ) spectra for identification of the material phase and crystallinity  Raman spectra were recorded using ( RenishawInVia microscope Raman  Resolution 1 cm− 1  excitation source 633 nm line of He-Ne laser )  Thickness and roughness measurements were performed using Dektak-150 Profilometer  3 Results and discussion PbI2 films were coated using the method described above  The UV-Visible absorption spectra  scanning electron microscopy image  XRD and the Raman spectra of the film is shown in Fig  2  The UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy results of the perovskite film coated by two- and three-step methods with different concentrations of MAI are shown in Fig  3  Photographs of the corresponding films are also shown  The results show absorption onset at 520 nm for the PbI2 film and ~ 780 nm for all perovskite samples  Insets show the corresponding plot with energy on the x-axis  The optical bandgap was calculated using the relation  Fig  2 figure 2 a Absorption spectrum  b XRD

ab }  ) is the absorption onset  The calculated value of optical bandgap is ~238 eV for the PbI2 film and ~158 eV for all the perovskite samples prepared by two- and three-step methods  The absorption onset and the calculated optical bandgap values matches with the reported values of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3  which confirms the formation of perovskite phase by both two-step and three-step methods [ 18 ]  Few reported values of bandgap have been compared with the values obtained in the present study in Table 1  Table 1 Reported values of optical bandgap have been compared with the values obtained in the present study Full size table In case of two-step method  absorption spectra show rise in absorption coefficient with decreasing wavelength below the absorption edge  At 10 mg/ml concentration  in addition to the perovskite absorption onset a distinct absorption kink at 520 nm was observed  Peak at 520 nm belongs to PbI2 absorption  This indicates that there may be presence of some amount of PbI2 in the film  along with the formed perovskite material  With 20 mg/ml and higher concentrations of MAI  the distinct clear kink at 520 nm was not observed  indicating better conversion of PbI2 into perovskite phase  However  absorption below 520 nm still increases and reaches maximum at 440 nm similar to that of PbI2 which indicates the presence of PbI2 phase  In case of three-step method  absorption spectra show rise in absorption coefficient with decreasing wavelength beyond the absorption edge  but no distinct kink at 520 nm was observed for concentrations above 10 mg/ml  This indicates better perovskite phase formation from PbI2 at lower concentrations of MAI  For 30 mg/ml and 40 mg/ml films  however  a distinctive kink at 580 nm was observed  Absorption feature at 580 nm is attributed to the intercalation state of MAI and PbI2  It is considered a red-shifted and broadened PbI2-like absorption [ 22 ]  The XRD patterns for two-step-coated films with varying concentrations of MAI over PbI2 layer are shown in Fig  4a  The sample coated with 10 mg/ml concentration of MAI shows the formation of perovskite phase ( prominent diffraction peaks at 142 and 286 values of  ( 2theta ) ) [ 15  23  24 ]  In addition  peaks ( at 127  255  388 values of  ( 2theta ) ) corresponding to PbI2 are also seen [ 232425 ]  This shows that complete conversion of PbI2 into perovskite phase has not taken place in the film  As the concentration of MAI is increased to 20 mg/ml  the peak intensity at 127 value of  ( 2theta ) decreases  indicating a better conversion of PbI2 phase  For 30 mg/ml concentration of MAI  intensity of peak at 127 reduces further as compared to that at 142  This shows further reduction in PbI2 phase compared to the perovskite phase  Along with the above trend  a new peak at 116 degree appears for the film with 20 mg/ml concentration of MAI  the intensity of which enhances with increase in MAI concentration  This peak is attributed to the intercalation of MAI into PbI2 [ 26 ]  For 40 mg/ml concentration of MAI  the peak at 127 degree corresponding to PbI2 phases vanishes nearly completely but with enhanced intensity of the peak at 116 degree  Significant change in the intensity of peak at 142 value of  ( 2theta ) was not observed  This shows that with increasing MAI concentration  no enhancement in perovskite phase formation was obtained  The increased MAI in the film leads to the formation of intercalated methyl ammonium into the lead iodide  XRD spectra of the films coated with three-step method are shown in Fig  4b  With 10 mg/ml concentration of MAI  the perovskite film shows features similar to that of film coated using 10 mg/ml with two-step method  The high intensity at 127 degree compared to 142 degree shows the dominance of PbI2 phase over the perovskite phase  With 20 mg/ml concentration of MAI  the peak corresponding to PbI2 is much reduced as compared to the perovskite peak at 142 degree  indicating the better conversion of PbI2 into perovskite  This is better perovskite formation as compared to the film coated with the same concentration using two-step coating method  With 30 mg/ml concentration of MAI  further reduction of PbI2 phase was observed but with enhanced intensity of peak at 116 degree  As the concentration of MAI was increased to 40 mg/ml  the intensity of peak at 142 degree corresponding to perovskite reduces indicating reduced perovskite phase available for X-ray diffraction  Fig  4 figure 4 XRD spectra of the films coated by a two-step and b three-step methods Full size image In order to study the morphology of film coated through two-step and three-step methods  scanning electron microscopic ( SEM ) images were recorded ( Fig  5 )  The morphology of the perovskite thin film obtained via sequential deposition methods was greatly influence by concentration MAI solution  In Two-step 10 mg/ml MAI concentration film  morphology shows hexagonal-shaped particles having diameter of 02–03 micrometer  These particles are in agglomerated form or are partially connected with each other  Along with these few particles with flake-like structure of length over one micrometer are also seen  When the MAI concentration was increased to 20 mg/ml  density of the bigger flake-like structures increases in the film  With 30 mg/ml concentration of MAI  a compact film morphology is obtained with irregular shaped particles  In 40 mg/ml concentration  again compact films are obtained compared but with occasional porous spots and with bigger grain size  Films with three-step coating method are in general more compact and with less pores as compared to the two-step-coated films with same MAI concentration  With 10 mg/ml MAI concentration  better interconnected films are obtained compared to two-step film  With 20 mg/ml concentration  good quality film with less voids were obtained  With higher MAI concentrations the morphology was nearly same

mg/ml and 40 mg/ml concentrations  respectively  e  f  g and h are films coated with three-step with 10 mg/ml  20 mg/ml  30 mg/ml and 40 mg/ml concentrations  respectively Full size image Raman spectroscopic measurements were performed for probing the effect of the MAI concentration on the organic-inorganic perovskite films  The excitation wavelength used in the present study is 633 nm  which is near resonance for Raman measurement of lead halide perovskite  As shown in Fig  2  most intense peak corresponding to PbI2 is at 113 cm− 1 [ 27  28 ]  The Raman spectra of formed perovskite films are shown in Fig  6  For perovskite coated by two-step method the peaks are found at 74  111  138  275 and at 355 cm− 1  Raman bands at 74 and 111 can be attributed to the stretching mode of Pb-I cage of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 [ 27  29 ]  We attribute the band at 138 cm− 1 to libration mode of MA+ cation and those at 275 cm− 1 and 355 cm− 1 can be assigned to the MA cation torsional mode of perovskite [ 29 ]  In 10 mg/ml MAI concentration film the intensity at 138 cm− 1 is much lower  This is in accordance with the XRD results  which shows incomplete transformation of PbI2 into perovskite  The intensity however increases with MAI concentration and is maximum for 30 mg/ml MAI concentration film  In the films coated by three-step method with 20 mg/ml concentration the band intensity at 138 cm− 1 is maximum  which indicates better perovskite phase formation as compared to the film formed by using two-step method  XRD results also show minimum intensity at 127 and 116 values of  ( 2theta ) for film coated by three-step method with 20 mg/ml concentration  Upon increasing the MAI concentration further  the intensity corresponding to libration mode of MA+ cation of perovskite decreases  This indicates that  in the third step the already formed perovskite ( after the second step ) is being washed away  This effect is more for the 40 mg/ml MAI concentration film  This is in accordance to the absorption spectra which shows a reduction in absorption  This also matches with the XRD studies  which show slight reduction in perovskite peak intensity  Fig  6 figure 6 Raman spectra of the different perovskite films deposited by two- and three-step methods  a two-step method and b three-step method Full size image The thickness and roughness values of the perovskite films have been shown in Table 2  It shows that for both two-step as well as three-step methods thickness of the film increases with MAI concentration  Thicknesses of films formed by three-step method are consistently greater than those formed with two-step method with same concentration  However  absorption coefficient of three-step films is not more than that of two-step films  This indicates that during the third step  some of the already formed perovskite is washed away and leaves some MAI in the film  Therefore  the thickness values obtained by profilometer are higher due to the excess MAI in the film especially for 30 mg/ml and 40 mg/ml films  Absorption as well as XRD studies have shown the presence of intercalated state of PbI2 and MAI  The average roughness values also increases with increasing MAI concentration due to the formation of bigger crystals as shown earlier in the SEM images  Roughness values for the two-step and three-step films are nearly same at 10 mg/ml MAI concentration  At higher MAI concentration  the three-step film roughness values are lower as compared to the two-step films  This may be due to the presence of excess MAI in three-step films  Above discussion indicates better perovskite phase formation for 20 mg/ml MAI concentration using three-step method  Table 2 Film thickness and roughness values of perovskite films are tabulated Full size table 4 Conclusions In conclusion  we have presented a comparative study of perovskite film properties formed by two-step and three-step sequential spin coating deposition techniques  Results show that at lower concentration of MAI  complete conversion of PbI2 does not take place in two-step method  With increase in MAI concentration  however intercalated MAI into PbI2 phase is formed  In three-step coating  good phase of perovskite and improved morphology is obtained at comparatively lower MAI concentration of 20 mg/ml  A higher concentration of MAI in three-step method leads to the removal of already formed perovskite material in the second step and leads to the formation of intercalated MAI and PbI2  We show that the MAI concentration is very important factor in complete conversion of PbI2 into the perovskite phase  References Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser ( 2020 ) - “ Fossil Fuels ”  Published online at OurWorldInDataorg  Retrieved from : ‘ https :

following link with will be able to read this content : Get shareable link Provided by the Springer Nature SharedIt content-sharing initiative Although the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) increases rapidly  there are still some issues that limit their commercialization  The perovskite is sensitive to the water molecules  increasing the difficulty in the preparation of perovskite films in ambient condition  Most high-performance PSCs based on conventional method are required to be prepared in inert atmosphere condition  which increase the fabrication cost  To fabricate the high-quality perovskite in ambient condition  we preheated the substrates and selected the proper anti-solvent  As a result  the target perovskite films show a better crystallinity compared with perovskite film prepared via the conventional one-step deposition method in ambient condition  The PSCs prepared in ambient condition yield the improved PCE of 1689 % from a PCE of 1159 %  Compared with the reference devices  the performance stability of target PSCs is much better than that of reference PSCs  Introduction Perovskite solar cells ( PSCs ) have been attracting a lot of attention since the organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite was used as the light harvester of solar cells [ 12345 ]  The perovskite film shows numerous excellent photoelectrical properties such as high light absorption coefficient  suitable bandgap  and good charge transport  The latest reported certified highest power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) reached 252 % ( https : //wwwnrelgov/pv/assets/pdfs/best-research-cell-efficiencies20200311pdf )  The conventional structure of PSCs contains charge transport layers  light harvester layer  and electrodes [ 67891011 ]  The light harvester layer inserted between charge transport layers is vital for photovoltaic performance of PSCs  Perovskite films are composed of numerous submicron-sized crystal grains  and the size of these grains is related to the preparation process of perovskite films  Most of the perovskite films were prepared in dry air or inert gas condition to avoid the affection of water molecules on the crystallization process of perovskite films  However  preparing perovskite films in inert gas condition or dry air would increase the fabrication cost  which is unfavored for the commercialization of PSCs  Since 2014  some research groups started to study the preparation method of PSCs in ambient condition [ 121314151617181920212223 ]  They fabricated the PSCs using two-step method  and they optimized the ingredient and deposition process of perovskite films  The highest PCE reached 16 %  Miyasaka group fabricated the mesoporous type PSCs based on CH3NH3PbI3 under the condition with a relative humidity of 30 % at 25 °C [ 22 ]  The devices yielded a PCE of 153 % and had a good reproducibility  The devices stored in dry-air and dark condition for 1 month retained 80 % of the initial PCE  In 2015  Mori et al  from Aichi Institute of Technology  used gas flow assist method to deposit the perovskite films in air condition ( relative humidity of 42–48 % at 25 °C ) [ 24 ]  The planar type PSCs based on these perovskite films has a PCE of 1632 % and 1331 % under reverse and forward scanning direction  respectively  Ko et al  fabricated mesoporous type CH3NH3PbI3 based PSCs in the condition with different humidity  and the devices prepared under the condition with a relative humidity of 50 % at 231 °C show the best photovoltaic performance with the highest PCE of 1576 % [ 14 ]  They used the tow-step deposition method  and the substrates were preheated before the spin-coating of PbI2 solution whose solvent was dimethylformamide ( DMF )  The obtained PbI2 had an enhanced transparency  and the PCE of devices has been increased to 15 % from 10 %  Enhanced preheat temperature induced the increase in grain sizes of perovskite films  but the residual PbI2 became more  Hence  it is important to find the proper preheat temperature to balance the crystal size and transfer efficiency of PbI2  In 2017  Cheng et al  increased the vapor pressure of the solvent to reduce the ingress of oxygen and water molecules during the PbI2 deposition through preheating the substrate before deposition of PbI2 films [ 12 ]  They obtained an air-processed PSCs fabricated under a humidity of 70 % RH  and the PCE reached 1811 %  There are some reports that the water molecules can improve the crystallization quality of perovskite films during the annealing step of the perovskite films when the one-step method is used to prepare the perovskite films  In 2014  You et al  found that the PCE of planar type PSCs based on CH3NH3PbI3-XClx improved under the particular humidity [ 23 ]  The perovskite films were annealed for 1 h under the relative humidity of 30 ± 5 % at room temperature  which increase the PCE to 166 %  The result also clarified that the proper humidity was beneficial to the formation of the more compact perovskite  A lot of study demonstrated that the relative humidity should be lower than 80 % during the preparation of the perovskite  In 2015  Lv et al  from Changzhou University used dimethylacetamide as the solvent of the perovskite [ 15 ]  This solvent can accelerate the crystallization of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite so that the affection of humidity on perovskite films would be decreased dramatically  Therefore  devices with the champion PCE of 1615 % were obtained under the condition with a relative humidity of 28 % at room temperature  In 2016  Sveinbjornsson et al  also preheated the substrate and optimized the temperature at range between 20 and 100 °C in ambient condition [ 19 ]  The PSCs based on ( FAPbI3 ) 1-x ( MAPbBr3 ) x with a preheat temperature of 50 °C yielded an average PCE of 176 %  In 2019  Li et al  optimized the preheat temperature and anti-solvent dropping time to fabricate the CH3NH3PbI3-based PSCs under the condition with a relative humidity of 90 % at room temperature [ 25 ]  They obtained the devices with a PCE output of 195 %  Engineering the anti-solvent is another effective way to improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs prepared in ambient condition  To avoid the affection of the moisture on the perovskite formation  the anti-solvent selection is very important  The commonly used anti-solvent includes chlorobenzene  diethyl ether  and ethyl acetate  Troughton et al  thought the ethyl acetate acted as both anti-solvent and moisture absorber material which reduce the affection of water molecules  so the ethyl acetate solvent is superior compared with other anti-solvent such as chlorobenzene and diethyl ether  Here  we used preheating method in one-step deposition process when preparing perovskite films in ambient condition ( relative humidity of 25–30 % at 20 °C )  We also used ethyl acetate solvent as the anti-solvent as the substitution to diethyl ether  The preheated substrate can accelerate the evaporation of the solvent  which can reduce the ingress of oxygen and moisture  Furthermore  diethyl ether can not only extract the solvent of perovskite but also absorb the water molecules  The target PSCs yield a better PCE of 1689 % compared with the reference PSCs  Compared with other fabrication methods  this method is more cost-effective and simpler  It does not need a complicated process  Methods Materials All of the materials were purchased form Ying Kou You Xuan Trade Co Ltd  if not specified  DMF and dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corp  The SnO2 nanoparticle colloidal solution was purchased from Alfa Aesar  The CH3NH3PbI3 solution was prepared by mixing PbI2  CH3NH3I  and DMSO into DMF according to ref  [ 26 ]  The HTL solution was prepared by dissolving 723 mg ( 229779-tetrakis ( N  N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine ) -99-spirobifluorene ) ( spiro-MeOTAD )  288 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine  175 μL of a stock solution of 520 mg/mL lithium bis ( trifluoromethylsulfonyl ) imide in acetonitrile  and 29 μL of a solution of 300 mg/ml FK209 in acetonitrile in 1 ml chlorobenzene  Preparation The ITO glasses were cleaned sequentially in acetone  absolute ethyl alcohol  and deionized water ultrasonic bath for 15 min  respectively  After ITO glasses were cleaned by the UV-Ozone treat for 20 min  a SnO2 film was deposited by spin-coating diluted SnO2 nanoparticle colloidal solution ( Alfa Aesar ( tin ( IV ) oxide  15 % in H2O colloidal dispersion ) ) according to ref  [ 27 ]  After the spin-coating  the SnO2 film was heated at 165 °C for 05 h Then  the substrates were treated with the UV-Ozone again and transferred into the glovebox  Perovskite films were prepared according to Fig  1  The HTL was prepared by spin-coating the HTL solution at 5000 rpm for 30 s Finally  100 nm of Au top electrode was thermally evaporated onto the HTL  Fig  1 figure 1 a Anti-solvent spin-coating method of perovskite film

PSCs was recorded by Keithley source unit 2400 under AM 154G sun intensity illumination by a solar silmulator from Newport Corp  The X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded with Bruker D8 ADVANCE A25X  Scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) was conducted on field emission fitting SEM ( FE-Inspect F50  Holland )  The absorption of perovskite was measured using Shimadzu 1500 spectrophotometer  Statistical data is plotted using box chart  Result and Discussion The process of the conventional anti-solvent spin-coating method ( AS ) and heat antisolvent spin-coating method ( HS ) is shown in Fig  1 a and b  respectively  Compared with AS  the substrates and mount for spin-coating need be preheated before the perovskite solution is dropped onto substrates  The anti-solvent is dropped onto the sample surface during the spin-coating process  After the spin-coating  the samples are transferred onto a heating plate with a temperature of 165 °C  The dropping of the anti-solvent is finished before the film become turbid  The photographs of perovskite films prepared with different methods are shown in Fig  1c  Here  the diethyl ether and ethyl acetate are used as the anti-solvent  Compared with diethyl ether  the ethyl acetate is more suitable for perovskite deposition in ambient condition  Ethyl acetate can absorb the water molecules and protect the perovskite film from water penetrating  Here  the perovskite films prepared with AS and HS method are referred to AS-perovskite and HS-perovskite  respectively  Here  we fabricated PSCs based on HS-perovskite and AS-perovskite  The PSCs based on AS-perovskite ( AS-PSCs ) were used as the reference devices  There were two different anti-solvents including diethyl ether and ethyl acetate used in preparation process of HS-perovskite  Only ethyl acetate was used as the anti-solvent in preparation process of AS-perovskite  The current density versus voltage ( J-V ) curves for the best-performance devices in each group are shown in Fig  2a  and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1  The statistical data of photovoltaic parameters for more than 15 devices in each group is shown in Fig  3  The PSCs based on HS-perovskite ( HS-PSCs ) yield a much better photovoltaic performance compared with AS-PSCs  The PSCs based on perovskite films prepared with HS method and ethyl acetate ( HS-EA-PSCs ) have the highest power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 1689 % with an open-circuit voltage ( VOC ) of 106 V  short-circuit current density ( JSC ) of 2298 mA/cm2  and fill factor ( FF ) of 6925 %  The hysteresis of the champion HS-EA-PSCs is shown in Fig  2b  The PSCs based on perovskite films prepared with HS method and diethyl ether ( HS-DE-PSCs ) yield a PCE of 1599 %  The PCE for reference PSCs is 1159 % which is much lower than PCEs of HS-PSCs  From the J-V curves and statistical data  the main reason for the photovoltaic performance improvement in HS-PSCs is the obviously increased current density  To explore the mechanism for the photovoltaic performance improvement  several characterizations have been carried out on the perovskite films  Fig  2 figure 2 a J-V cures of PSCs based on different perovskite ( black line : HS EA  red line : HS DE  blue line : AS EA ) ( HS EA stands for PSCs based on perovskite prepared via preheating method with an anti-solvent of ethyl acetate  HS DE

anti-solvent of ethyl acetate )  b J-V curves of PSCs based on HS EA under different scanning direction  c PCE variation with time  and d normalized PCE variation with time Full size image Table 1 Photovoltaic parameters of PSCs based on different perovskite Full size table Fig  3 figure 3 Statistic data of photovoltaic parameters including VOC ( a )  JSC ( b )  FF ( c )  and PCE ( d ) Full size image The stability of PSCs based on different perovskite films is also been characterized  The devices were stored under air condition  and the photovoltaic performance was measured every day  The PCE change with the time is shown in Fig  2b  After 1 week  the PCE of HS-PSCs decreased to 1425 % from the initial PCE of 1689 %  and the value retained 843 % of the initial PCE  However  the PCE of AS-PSCs dropped to 699 % from 1209 %  and the value remained only 578 % of the initial PCE value  The normalized PCE changes of different devices are shown in Fig  2c  The stability results clarify that the HS-PSCs have a much better performance stability  The reason for the better stability will be discussed in following parts  The crystallinity and topography of the perovskite affect the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs  A compact and uniform perovskite film is essential for the excellent device performance  The compact light absorption layer can avoid the direct contact between electron transport layer and hole transport layer ( HTL )  and the uniform surface is beneficial to the complete coverage of the HTL  reducing the short-circuit loops inside devices  The scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) images of perovskite prepared with different methods are shown in Fig  4  From the SEM images  the perovskite films are compact and uniform  and the crystal boundaries are clear  The perovskite film prepared with HS method shows a much larger average grain size inducing a less boundary and lower defect density  The distributions of the perovskite crystal size are shown in Fig  5  The average size of the perovskite prepared with AS method and HS method is 280 nm and 360 nm  respectively  From Fig  3  the proportion of crystal grains with a size more than 400 nm in HS-perovskite is much larger than that in AS-perovskite  which is consistent with the surface SEM image result  The larger crystal size results in a better moisture stability of perovskite films  Fig  4 figure 4 SEM images of perovskite prepared with AS method ( a ) and HS method ( b ) Full size image Fig  5 figure 5 Grain size distribution of perovskite films prepared with AS method ( a ) and HS method ( b ) Full size image The crystallinity of perovskite films is characterized using x-ray diffraction ( XRD ) measurements  The XRD patterns are shown in Fig  6  The peak located at 141°  284° and 313° corresponds to ( 110 )  ( 220 )  and ( 310 ) plane of perovskite films  respectively  There are no apparent peaks around 12° in the XRD pattern  indicating that there is almost no PbI2 residue in both perovskite films  The perovskite film based on AS method with the anti-solvent of EA has a higher XRD peak  clarifying a better crystallinity  Fig  6 figure 6 a XRD pattern of HS-perovskite and AS-perovskite  b UV-visible light absorption curves of different perovskite films Full size image The UV-visible light absorption measurement is conducted to characterize the light absorption capacity of perovskite prepared by different methods  The perovskite films apparent absorption when the incident light wavelength is below 770 nm  The absorption edges of perovskite films prepared with different methods overlap  demonstrating all perovskite films have a similar bandgap and the ingredient of perovskite films is not affected by the preparing methods  The absorption of HS-perovskite films is higher than that of AS-perovskite films in the wavelength range of 450–700 nm  The higher absorption of HS-perovskite films results in higher photo-induced-carrier density  leading to a higher current density in devices operated under the sunlight illumination  Conclusion In summary  we used preheating assisted one-step method to fabricate high-quality perovskite films in ambient condition  We also compared the different anti-solvents to prepare the perovskite films  The target PSCs based on perovskite prepared HS method with an anti-solvent of EA showed the best photovoltaic performance with an improved PCE of 1689 % compared with that of reference PSCs  The enhanced photovoltaic performance results from the better crystallinityAbstract The utilization of mixed cations is beneficial for taking the advantages of cations and achieving highly efficient perovskite solar cells ( PSCs )  Herein  the precisely small incorporation of CH ( NH2 ) 2 ( FA ) cations in methyl ammonium lead iodide ( MAPbI3 ) enables the formation of compact  smooth perovskite film with high crystallinity  Consequently  the short-circuit current and the fill factor of the PSCs based on FAxMA1-xPbI3 perovskite are greatly improved  leading to the enhanced device efficiency  The champion PSC based on FA01MA09PbI3 exhibits a remarkably high efficiency of 2202 %  Furthermore  the PSCs based on FA01MA09PbI3 perovskite also show improved device stability  This work provides a simple approach to fabricate high-quality perovskite films and high-performance PSCs with better stability  Introduction From the past decade  the increase in industrial and domestic energy needs has not only created an energy crisis but also causing problems derived from global warming  Semiconductor technology played a significant role to overcome these crises with minimal environmental problems  Semiconductor material-based solar cells are environmental friendly such as silicon  compound semiconductor  oxides  and organic materials [ 1  2 ]  Perovskite material-based solar cells ( PSCs ) have become the focus due to its high power conversion efficiency rocketing from 38 % in 2009 up to 252 % to now [ 3 ]  The remarkable high power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of PSCs relies on the unique optoelectronic properties of the perovskite materials  and perovskite material engineering is a key approach to improve the device performance  Generally  perovskite is a material with the same type of crystal structure based on the formula ABX3  where A is an organic cation ( like CH3NH2+ ) or alkali cation ( Cs+ ) or their mixing cations  B is the metal anion ( Pb+2 or Sn+2 )  and X refers the halide anions ( X = I−  Br−  or Cl− ) [ 45678910 ]  Among the perovskite materials  FAxMA1-xPbI3 ( MA  methyl ammonium ; FA  formamidinium ) is the highly used material in PSCs  As FA+ has a bit larger size ( ionic radius = 279 Å ) as compared to MA+ ( ionic radius = 270 Å )  FAxMA1-xPbI3 possesses a lower band gap than MAPbI3  which thus allow for higher solar light harvesting efficiency [ 8  111213141516171819 ]  Mostly  a small amount of MA cation is doped with FA cation to fabricate FAxMA1-xPbI3 perovskite  which promotes the formation of the photoactive FA cation phase than pure FAPbI3 and lead to high device efficiency [ 192021 ]  However  even with the incorporation of MA cations  it is yet very challenging to achieve pure black phased FA perovskite without any trace of yellow phased FA perovskite because of the larger ionic radius of FA cations specially when large amount of FA is used  This issue has been frequently observed in spite of the high efficiency of these PSCs  since this affects the structural and thermal stability of the PSCs devices [ 22  23 ]  Therefore  in order to achieve high efficiency and device stability in FAxMA1-xPbI3-based PSCs  the formation of the yellow phase defects needs to be prevented  In this work  instead of using a large amount of FA cations in FAxMA1-xPbI3 perovskite  we use a small amount of FA to fabricate FA01MA09PbI3 planar film  which enables the champion device efficiency exceeding 22 %  Different from the results reported from mesoporous perovskite film [ 24 ]  we found the introduction of small FA into MAI within the gaps of the PbI6 octahedra stabilizing the MAPbI3 perovskite structure into a “ quasi-cubic ” phase at room temperature  Furthermore  the improvements here mainly derive from the largely increased JSC  benefiting from the formation of compact  smooth  high-quality perovskite film with the incorporation of FA  Furthermore  the PSCs based on FA01MA09PbI3 perovskite also show improved device stability  Results and Discussions The employed device structure of the PSCs in this work is shown schematically in Fig  1  where SnO2 layer is used as the electron transport layer ( ETL )  Spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport layer ( HTL )  and gold ( Au ) as the anode  Both standard and modified perovskite layers were deposited on the indium tin oxide ( ITO ) transparent electrode as the absorbing layer by conventional one-step solvent-engineering method  Fig  1 figure 1 Schematic structure of perovskite solar cell Full size image Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) was employed to investigate the morphology of the perovskite films  The film prepared with pristine MAPbI3 shows a higher ratio of grain boundaries as shown in Fig  2a  The pinholes together with lots of grain boundaries in the perovskite film promote the non-radiative recombination and reduce the device efficiency of the PSCs  In contrast  homogenous  pinhole-free perovskite film is achieved due to the incorporation of FA cations into pristine MAPbI3 ( FA01MA09PbI3 ) film  as shown in Fig  2b  It presents the closely packed structure with a small enlargement in the grain size and much less grain boundaries  A compact  smooth film morphology with a large grain size will minimize the trap states and defects in the perovskite film  Fig  2 figure 2 Top view SEM images of MAPbI3 ( a ) and FA01MA09PbI3 ( b )  Photoluminescence ( PL ) spectra of standard and modified perovskite on glass substrates  c Time-resolved photoluminescence ( TRPL ) spectra of both standard and modified perovskite films ( d ) Full size image The steady-state photoluminescence ( PL ) spectra of both MAPbI3 and FA01MA09PbI3 perovskite films are shown in Fig  2c  As expected  a significant redshift in the emission peak is noticed  In addition  peak narrowing was also observed  This significant shift is due to the introduction of FA into MA in perovskite lattice  Furthermore  PL intensity is also increased by some extent with the addition of FA cations  which indicates the decrease in trap states and in return gives highly crystalline FA01MA09PbI3 film  In order to understand more about the decrease in trap states of the modified perovskite layer as compared to a standard device  time-resolved photoluminescence ( TRPL ) was performed on perovskite film based on each material as shown in Fig  2d  Since perovskite layer is deposited on the glass substrate without any transport layer  so it is expected that the carrier recombination represents only the interlayer charge transport ( ie  non-radiative recombination )  which would show longer carrier lifetime and slower interlayer recombination with the incorporation of FA in MAPbI3 [ 25  26 ]  Two components of time can be obtained to calculate the carrier recombination lifetime of the as-prepared perovskite film of each type by fitting the TRPL curve with bi-exponential function of time ( t ) : ( 1 ) where τ1 and τ2 in Eq  1 represent the time constant of fast decay and slow decay process  respectively [ 27 ]  The fast decay τ1 component represents the surface recombination  whereas the slow decay component is related to the recombination taking place in the bulk of the perovskite structure  All the fitted TRPL parameters for standard and modified perovskite samples are summarized in table S1  and the average recombination lifetime ( τave ) of both perovskite layers was calculated approximately from the fitted curve data according to the formula shown in supplementary information  Such as  in comparison with the standard perovskite film with an average lifetime decay time of 2461 ns  FAMAPbI3 ( 10 % ) film shows noticeably longer carrier average lifetime of 4992 ns  indicating the suppression of non-radiation recombination in modified PSCs  X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) was employed to investigate the crystallinity of the perovskite films  Figure 3a shows the main diffraction peak of the perovskite film at 2θ of 1424° exhibits preferred orientation with higher intensity  where the small incorporation of FA into standard MAPbI3 perovskite film enables the diffraction intensity much stronger  suggesting the higher crystallinity  Furthermore  the diffraction peaks of the modified perovskite layer shift towards small angle  The prominent peaks shift from 1461° and 2884° to 1424° and 2849°  respectively  as shown in Fig  3b  c Since the size of FA cations is larger than the MA cations  the lattice size increases with the incorporation of FA ions  which is in accordance with Bragg ’ s equation ( 2d sinθ = nλ )  Moreover  the introduction of the FA cation with the MA also decreases the tolerance_factor and provokes the formation of a stable cubic perovskite phase  Note that depending on the film morphology and deposition conditions  adding a small amount of FA ( 01 ) may also precede to a tetragonal phase  The full width and half maximum ( FWHM ) was used to estimate the grain size in the perovskite films  In FA01MA09PbI3  the value of FWHM of the highest peak is 0133°  as shown in the supplementary information Fig  S1a b  which gives the evidence of increase in grain size with higher crystallinity as compared to MAPbI3 film ( FWHM 0174° )  Fig  3 figure 3 XRD patterns ( a ) for MAPbI3 and FA01MA09PbI3 perovskite films and enlarged XRD pattern of the peaks at 13–15° ( b ) and 27–29° ( c ) Full size image In order to confirm the element composition after precisely small incorporation of FA cations  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) measurements were carried out on both standard and modified perovskite layers  The presence of FA into MA cations can be confirmed by the identified C–C bond ( 2848 eV ) as shown in Fig  4a  c Furthermore  the appeared bond of C–N ( 4013 eV ) and C=N ( 40010 eV ) is from incorporated FA cations which can be observed clearly in N1s spectrum of FA01MA09PbI3 perovskite [ 27 ] as shown in Fig  4b  For further analysis of the element composition  energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ( EDX ) was performed as shown in Fig S2 a & b  We can evidently equate the chemical composition ; the integration of elements peaks demonstrates a quantified atomic ratio % of C to N to Pb 4475 ( 23 ) :2273 ( 11 ) :1934 ( 1 ) for MAPbI3 and 4771 ( 23 ) :2734 ( 13 ) :2015 ( 1 ) for FA01MA09PbI3 perovskite [ 28 ]  Fig  4 figure 4 XPS measurement for elements for MAPbI3 and FA01MA09PbI3 perovskite films  Carbon ( a  c )  Nitrogen ( b  d ) Full size image Kelvin probe force microscopy ( KPFM ) technique was used to further analyze the perovskite film  which measures the contact potential difference ( CPD ) between the tip and the surface of the sample beneath [ 14  23 ]  The surface roughness is remarkably decreased from 20488 to 4778 nm with the incorporation of FA into MAPbI3 perovskite  as shown by the topographical images in Fig  5a  d This further reveals the compact  smooth morphology of the perovskite film with FA doping  The surface morphology of both standard and modified perovskite films in three dimensions ( 3D ) is shown in Fig  5b and e  respectively  The surface potential images are shown in Fig  5c  f  and the 3D images are shown in the supplementary information Fig  S3 ( b & c )  It is clear that FA01MA09PbI3 film shows more homogenous potential distribution than MAPbI3 film  indicating less surface defects at the surface of FA01MA09PbI3 film  Meanwhile  the FA01MA09PbI3 film demonstrates higher surface potential at the grain boundaries than the standard perovskite film  which will lower the trapping and recombination probability of the minority carriers and stipulates current path for minority carriers to reach the corresponding selective contacts  Herein  it will improve the overall performance of the PSCs heading towards better charge transport with suppressed recombination  SnO_2 TiO_2 ZnO PCDTBT Spiro-OMeTAD PBDTTPPD P_3HT WO_3 CuS CuI Fe_3O_4 PBDB-T MAPbI_3 MAPbBr_3 FA Fig  5 figure 5 Topography images ( a  d )  3D

6a  b  These perovskite films are fabricated on the top of SnO2 ETL  It can be seen clearly that the ETL/perovskite interface is greatly improved with the incorporation of FA in perovskite  It can also be seen that FA01MA09PbI3 film is much more compact and smooth than MAPbI3 film  These improvements favor for efficient carrier extraction at interfaces  Ultraviolet-visible ( UV-Vis ) absorption spectra were measured to analyze the absorption features of the perovskite films  as shown in Fig  6c  FA01MA09PbI3 film shows slightly higher absorption intensities than the MAPbI3 film  The band gap values have been calculated using the Tauc plot spectra shown in S4 a & S4b  which are 158 eV for MAPbI3 and 154 eV for FA01MA09PbI3  demonstrating that the small incorporation of FAI cations into the MAI lattice matrix reduces the band gap  The reduced band gap is beneficial to develop high-efficiency perovskite solar cells  Fig  6 figure 6 Cross-sectional images of MAPbI3 ( a ) and FA01MA09PbI3 ( b ) films on the top of ETL/ITO and the absorption spectra ( c ) of perovskite films Full size image The PSCs based on MAPbI3 ( standard PSC ) and FA01MA09PbI3 ( modified PSC ) are constructed with the structure of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au  The current density-voltage ( J-V ) curves are shown in Fig  7a  and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1  It is clear that the short-circuit current density ( JSC ) of modified PSCs is obviously higher than that of standard PSCs  leading to a significant increase in device efficiency  The maximum PCE of modified PSCs is 2202 % with an open-circuit voltage ( VOC ) of 113 V  JSC of 2587 mAcm−2  and a fill factor ( FF ) of 075  The remarkable improvements in JSC and PCE of modified PSCs based on FA01MA09PbI3 strongly imply improved carrier collection  Due to the compact and smooth surface features of FA01MA09PbI3 films with a large grain size and better crystallinity  charge extraction and transport are enabled with minimal loss induced by recombination processes  Hence  JSC is greatly increased  and  meanwhile  VOC is also improved  The increased JSC is also partially contributed by the reduced band gap and the enhanced absorption in FA01MA09PbI3 film ( as revealed by the absorption features shown in Fig  6c )  To further explore the effect of FA into MAPbI3  we also used different ratios of FA ( 5–20 % )  and the resultant device performance of the corresponding PSCs is shown in Fig  S5 and Table S2  The incorporation of FA in the perovskite with a molar ratio from 5 to 20 % increases JSC and PCE  achieving the high efficiency of the modified PSCs  The best values of the device performance are obtained in the condition of using FA01MA09PbI3  Fig  7 figure 7 J-V curves ( a )  dV/dJ vs ( JSC + J

modified perovskite in comparison with standard PSCs ( d ) Full size image Table 1 Photovoltaic characteristics of standard and modified PSCs Full size table To investigate the underlying mechanisms for the remarkably improved device performance with the small incorporation of FA  the parameters of series resistance ( RS ) and reverse saturable current density ( J0 ) have been characterized [ 29  30 ]  The J-V characteristics are stated by : ( 1 ) where J is the current flowing through the external load  Jph is the photocurrent density generated by a diode  A is the device area  RSH is the shunt resistance  m refers to ideality factor of the pn juntion  Kβ is the Boltzman ’ s constant  and T and e are the temperature and electronic charge  respectively [ 31  32 ]  For an ideal condition ( RSH is large enough ) [ 33  34 ]  Eq  1 can be written as : ( 2 ) ( 3 ) RS can be obtained from the –dV/dJ vs ( JSC − J ) −1 plots in Fig  7b with a linear fitting curve in accordance with Eq  2  which are 48 Ω cm2 and 23 Ω cm2 for standard PSC with MAPbI3 and modified PSC with FA01MA09PbI3  respectively  This decrease in RS for the modified PSC indicates better carrier transport and contributes to the high JSC  J0 determined from ln ( JSC + J ) vs ( V − RSJ ) plots in Fig  7c is 143 × 10−2  and 116 × 10−5 mAcm−2 for MAPbI3 and FA01MA09PbI3 PSCs  respectively  A smaller J0 indicates lower recombination  and thus  VOC of the modified PSCs is improved  The reduced recombination by FA incorporation is also consitent with the KPFM measurement  Moreover  the crosssponding external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) has been calculated  where broad photoresponses with high values are obtained ; the calculated integrated current densities ( JSC ) are 2488 mAcm−2 and 2025 mAcm−2 for best modified and standard devices  respectively  as shown in Fig  7d which is consistent with the JSC value calculated from J-V test  In general  EIS is a suitable tool to analyze the internal electrical process of PSCs  Herein  EIS were performed as a voltage function  The obtained data were fitted with ZView using appropriate equivalent circuit as shown in Fig  8a  The recombination resistance ( Rrec ) of each perovskite solar cell is calculated from the diameter of the semicircle  It can be seen clearly that Rrec of modified perovskite solar increased with the small incorporation of FA into MAPbI3 which indicates the significant decrease in undesired recombination and in return lowers the defect density of PSCs  Fig  8 figure 8 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS ) Nyquist plot for modified perovskite in comparison with standard PSCs ( a )  Normalized PCE vs time plots of standard and modified PSCs ( b ) Full size image Figure 8b shows that the modified PSC with FA01MA09PbI3 keeps its original value up to 80 % even after 800 h  while the standard PSC with MAPbI3 only retains less than 60 % of its original value  The improved stability of the PSC with FA01MA09PbI3 correlates to the high quality of the FA01MA09PbI3 perovskite film  The device stability issues of the PSCs were also characterized within different time intervals under ambient conditions  In order to confirm the repeatability of the PSCs  the average performance of both MAPbI3 and FA01MA09PbI3 PSCs averaged from more than 40 devices are shown in Table 1  and the statistics of the photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig  9a–d  It can be seen that in PSCs with FA01MA09PbI3  the average performance is also obviously superior to the PSCs with MAPbI3 and show better reproducibility  Fig  9 figure 9 Statistics of VOC  FF PCE  and JSC from more than 40 devices for each kind of PSCs ( a–d ) Full size image Experimental Details Materials and Methods CH3NH3I

120 °C  After cooling down  the hole transport material Spiro-OMeTAD was deposited on the top of the perovskite layer by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s After the spin coating of all the layers was finished  the samples were kept out of the glove box overnight for a better oxidation process  Finally  80 nm of gold ( Au ) was deposited by the thermal evaporation under 4 × 10−4 Pa vacuum conditions to complete the device structure  Device Characterization Current-voltage characterization was carried out with a digital source meter ( Keithley Model 2400 ) at AM 15G at 100 mW cm−2

)  Kelvin probe force microscopy ( KPFM ) measurements were taken using the MFP-3D infinity of Asylum Research  All characterizations were accomplished under constant exposure to ambient conditions and without device encapsulation  Conclusion In our work  a precisely small amount of FA cations is introduced into MA cations of standard MAPbI3-based perovskite film to enhance the film quality in terms of smoothness and crystallinity with full surface coverage  The remarkable PCE of 2202 % and significantly enhanced JSC has been obtained from the PSCs based on FA01MA09PbI3 perovskite  Furthermore  the enhancement in VOC as a consequence of reduced carrier recombination is also obtained  These results reveal that high-efficiency PSCs with superior stability can be repeatability fabricated based on the compact  smooth perovskite film with improved crystallinity enabled by the incorporation of a small value of FAI cations into MAPbI3  Availability of Data and Materials of HS-EA perovskite films  The better crystallinity of perovskite also results in a higher performance stability  This work has clarified that preheating assisted one-step mOxoammonium cation of 2266-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl ( TEMPO ) was used as an oxidizing dopant of triaryl amines to efficiently and almost quantitatively generate radical cations of the amines or a hole carrier  The doped-triaryl amines yielded an amorphous and homogeneous layer without any residual oxidant or neutral TEMPO molecule through its sublimination or warming the layer  The TEMPO cation-doped spiro-OMeTAD [ tetrakis ( dimethoxyphenylamine ) spirobifluorene ] produced a high hole mobility of 2 × 10−4 cm2/Vs  The perovskite solar cell fabricated with the TEMPO cation-doped or residual dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD as the hole-transporting layer displayed a photo-conversion efficiency of 201 % with durability  Similar content being viewed by others Triphenylamine 36-carbazole derivative

as additive-free hole-transport material for perovskite solar cells Article 01 July 2017 Introduction Nitroxide radical molecules  such as 2266-tetramethylpiperidin-l-oxyl ( TEMPO )  have attracted considerable interests [ 1 ] as a metal-free oxidizing catalyst  especially in synthesis of pharmaceutical products and modification of biomass  [ 23 ] while they have been also extensively studied in living radical polymerization  [ 45 ] molecular magnetism  [ 67 ] cathode-active materials in rechargeable batteries  [ 8 ] and hole-transporting materials ( HTMs ) in dye-sensitized solar cells  [ 910 ] In the catalytic cycle  the oxoammonium cation of TEMPO ( TEMPO+ ) acts as the oxidizing species involving redox reaction between the TEMPO+ and the neutral TEMPO [ Fig  1 ( a ) ]  The TEMPO+ cation performs excellent oxidizing reactivity because of both highly positive redox potential and tremendously high kinetics in the redox reaction compared with other redox reagents  [ 1112 ] Figure 1 figure 1 Redox reaction of ( a ) TEMPO/TEMPO+ and chemical structures of the triaryl amines  ( b ) spiro-OMeTAD  and ( c ) MeO-TPD  Full size image Organic HTMs have been successfully exploited in electric and photo-electric devices such as transistors  electroluminescent devices  and photovoltaic cells  [ 1314 ] The typical compounds are triaryl amine derivatives because of their thermal stability or high glass-transition temperature  amorphous layerforming capability  and robustness  The hole-transporting characteristics to enhance the device performance require both appropriate hole-carrier density and high hole-carrier mobility to decrease internal device resistance  [ 15 ] Doping of HTMs is a well-known method to enlarge the carrier density  using oxidizing chemical reagents as the dopant such as iodine  sulfonic acid  and metal complexes  [ 16 ] Dopant species and amount significantly affected the hole-transporting property so that appropriate doping procedure on HTMs is crucial  [ 15 ] Organo-lead halide perovskite-based solar cells are emerging as a new class of photovoltaics  [ 1718 ] and their photoconversion efficiency has reached beyond 20 % in a short period of time  [ 1920 ] Although tremendous efforts have been devoted to improve HTMs for hole-transporting layers ( HTLs ) of the cells  2  2′  7  7′-tetrakis ( N  N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine ) -99′-spiro-bifluorene ( spiro-OMeTΛD ) [ 2122 ] exhibited the best performance in the photo-conversion or has been recognized as the standard HTM for the perovskite solar cells  [ 23 ] As the oxidizing dopant for spiro-OMeTAD  N ( PhBr ) 3SbCl6 had been employed  which was a stoichiometric dopant for N  N  N′  N′-tetrakis ( 4-methoxy-phenyl ) benzidine ( MeO-TPD )  because of reproducibility in the device performance via tuning of its doping ratio  [ 21 ] Cobalt ( IΠ ) complexes with a series of organic ligands  tris [ 2- ( 1H-pyrazol-1-yl ) -4-tert-butylpyridine ] cobalt ( III ) tris- [ bis ( trifluoromethylsulfonyl ) imide ] ( FK209 ) [ 24 ] as the typical complex used  have been studied as the dopants of HTMs including spiro-OMeTAD to yield effective HTMs  [ 25 ] The combination of spiro-OMeTAD and FK209 was successfully applied to the HTLs of the perovskite solar cells to enhance their conversion efficiency  [ 19 ] However  the residual dopant in HTLs  such as the cobalt ( II ) complex  often migrated to the photoactive perovskite layer and tremendously degraded the cell performance with the passage of time  [ 26 ] to which limited the practical development of the perovskite solar cells  We anticipated here that the metal-free and highly reactive oxidant  the TEMPO+ cation  acts as an effective dopant of triaryl amine HTMs  because the TEMPO formed after doping could be completely removed with very facile sublimation ( sublimation temperature of TEMPO = 41 °C ) or warming the HTL to yield a metal contamination-free HTL  In this paper  the TEMPO+ cation was applied as the dopant of HTMs including spiro-OMeTAD  and their hole-transporting property was described  Perovskite solar cells were fabricated with the TEMPO+-doped HTLs to demonstrate the effects of the doping agent of HTM on the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells  Materials and methods Bis ( trifluoromethanesulfonyl ) imide salt of 2266-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxoammonium cation ( TEMPO+TFSI− ) was prepared via one-pot one-electron oxidation of TEMPO  TEMPO ( 34 g ) and TFSI acid ( 48 % aqueous solution  52 mL ) were stirred at room temperature for 2 h Sodium hypochlorite aqueous solution ( 145 mL ) was added to the mixture to yield the TEMPO+ salt of TFSI  The precipitate was washed with acetone to give a slightly yellowish powder ( 57 g  yield 60 % )  The product was ESR-inactive  which supported the conversion of TEMPO radical to the corresponding cation  1H NMR ( ™  ppm ) : 184 ( s  12H  CH3 ) ; 248 ( m  2H  CH2 ) ;

fabricated according to the previously reported literature [ 172023 ] TiO2 compact layer was sprayed using titanium acetylacetonate in ethanol solution ( 1/4 vol ) on FTO substrate which was etched with Zn powder and HCl aqueous  After soaking in 200 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 45 min and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min  TiO2 nanoparticle dispersion ( PST-18NM  Nikki Shokubai Kasei Co  Japan ) was casted on the substrate and spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 20 s The substrates were heated at 70 °C for 1 h and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min and soaked with 10 mM TiCl4 solution  After sintering at 500 °C for 30 min  the perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated  For methylammonium lead iodide perovskite ( MAPbI3 )  lead iodide ( 5071 mg ) was dissolved in N  N-dimethylformamide ( DMF ) ( 1 mL )  The solution was spin-coated at 6500 rpm for 10 s After annealing at 70 °C for 30 min  the isopropylalcohol solution of methylammonium iodide ( 10 mg/mL ) was spin-coated at 2000 rpm

s Chlorobenzene was dropped onto the substrate after spinning for 28 s The substrates were annealed at 100 °C for 90 min  Spiro-OMeTAD ( 429 mg ) was dissolved in the chlorobenzene ( 500 µL ) solution of lithium bis ( trifluoromethanesulfonyl ) imide ( 97 µL of 520 mg/mL in acetonitrile )  tert-butylpyridine ( 169 µL )  and acetonitrile solution of the TEMPO+ salt was added  The mixed solution ( 40 µL ) was spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 20 s Before Au deposition ( thickness approximately 100 nm )  the substrate was put in vacuo for 1 h Results and discussion The TEMPO+ salt was highly soluble in polar solvents such as acetonitrile and THF  The acetonitrile solutions of TEMPO and TEMPO+ of the TFSI− salt gave a reversible redox peak at 069 V ( versus Ag/AgCl ) in their cyclic voltammogram as previously reported [ 12 ] which agreed with the redox potentials of TEMPO [ Fig  1 ( a ) ]  The electrochemical redox potential corresponded to almost 533 eV  which was appropriately more positive or deeper than those of MeO-TPD  spiro-OMeTAD  and other hole-transporting triaryl amines  [ 27 ] and suggested a charge transfer from TEMPO+ to the amines or an effective doping of the amines with TEMPO+ ( Fig  2 )  Figure 2 figure 2 Redox potential or energy level of TEMPO+  MeO-TPD  spiro-OMeTAD  and the CH3NH3Pbl3 and RbCs ( MA ) ( FA ) Pb ( IBr ) 3 perovskite  Full size image The charge transfer or the relationship between the doping degree and the dopant amount was examined with UV-vis spectroscopy  The addition of TEMPO+ to the triaryl amines  spiro-OMeTAD  and MeO-TPD enhanced the absorbance at 490–520 nm which was ascribed to the radical cation formation of the amines such as the cation of spiro-OMeTAD ( see Fig  S1 in Supporting Information  where the decreasing peak at 360–390 nm was attributed to that of the amines )  The proportionally increased doping degree meant a quantitative doping of the triaryl amines with TEMPO+  The doping degree of spiro-OMeTAD and MeO-TPD was estimated with the absorption coefficient of 34 × 104 and 15 × 105L/mol·cm  respectively ( Fig  3 )  For example  the doping degree of spiro-OMeTAD with the TEMPO+ ( added amount of 60 mol % versus spiro-OMeTAD ) was 96 %  which was significantly higher than that ( 62 % ) using the conventional Co-dopant  [ 28 ] The strong oxidizing and side-reaction-free capability of TEMPO+ resulted in the high conversion yield or quantitative doping of the triaryl amines  The doping with TEMPO+ also proceeded efficiently for the methoxy-substituted derivatives  such as 4-methoxytriphenylamine and 3-methoxythiophene  Figure 3 figure 3 Doping degree of spiro-oMeTAD ( o ) and MeO-TPD ( □ ) with additional amount of the dopant TEMPO+ TFSl−  Full size image Upon doping process  the oxidant TEMPO+ converted itself to the neutral TEMPO molecule : TEMPO sublimates at room temperature and is easily removed by warming under reduced pressure  Elimination of the residual TEMPO+ and/or TEMPO from the doped-triaryl amines layer was proven for the TEMPO+-doped spiro-OMeTAD layer ( thickness 500 nm ) upon a glass plate by FTIR spectroscopy  The absorption peaks in the fingerprint region at 970–1350 cm−1 attributed to the TEMPO and TEMPO+ completely disappeared after heating the layer at 25 °C under reduced pressure for 1 h Differential scanning calorimetry of the TEMPO+-doped spiro-OMeTAD specimen supported the removal of the residual TEMPO+ through the elimination of TEMPO ( no peak at 41 °C derived from TEMPO in Fig  S2 in Supporting Information )  Hole-transporting mobility of the TEMPO+-doped spiro-OMeTAD layer was estimated with impedance spectroscopy on a hole-only device with the configuration of ITO/spiro-OMeTAD/Au  as in the previously reported procedure  [ 29 ] Diffusion- and recombination-limited carrier transport allowed to calculate the hole mobility using the equation µ = eD/kBT  Diffusion coefficient D was given as D = L2/τd by means of time constant τd 0018 and 0024 ms for the TEMPO and FK209-doped layer  respectively  using the time constant for the reciprocal of frequency under 05 V bias voltage and the 100 nm diffusion layer thickness  The calculated hole-transporting mobility µ = 21 × 10−4cm2/Vs for the TEMPO+-doped spiro-OMeTAD was higher than that of the FK209-doped one ( 16 × 10−4 cm2/Vs )  probably because of the residual dopant-free state  which supported the TEMPO+ as the effective dopant to give high hole-transporting capability to the triamines  These results were not in conflict with those previously reported [ 30 ] An organo-lead halide perovskite-based solar cells were fabricated to demonstrate that hole-transporting triaryl amine plays an important role in the device  A cross-sectional SEM image of the cell ( Fig  4 ) displayed the TEMPO+-doped spiro-OMeTAD HTL as a homogeneous layer of approximately 250 nm thickness without any void and pinhole and disordered interface upon the perovskite layer ( 300 nm thickness ) even after the sublimation of TEMPO molecule under reduced pressure  Figure 4 figure 4 Cross-sectional SEM image of the perovskite solar cell

Photovoltaic performance of the cells using the TEMPO+-doped triaryl amines as HTL was preliminarily examined for the simple CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite photoabsorption layer ( Table I )  The performance of the cell with the TEMPO+-doped spiro-OMeTAD was higher than that of the TEMPO+-doped MeO-TPD  as has been ascribed  for the FK209-doped Spiro-OMeTAD  [ 27 ] to the appropriate HOMO energy level  high hole mobility  and/or high film-forming property  Counter anion of TEMPO+  which remained in the HTL after the elimination of TEMPO  affected the performance  especially current density  The cell fabricated with the TEMPO+ TFSI−-doped HTL displayed low series resistance  to improve the fill factor to be often 080  On the other hand  the did not  probably because anion may cause a trap state due to its high dissociation degree upon the hole transportation  Mixed cation perovskite Cs ( MA ) ( FA ) Pb ( IBr ) 3 [ MA ( methylammonium ) and FA ( formamidinium ) ] which was reported as one of the most efficient photo-absorbing layers [ 24 ] was used to fabricate the cells with the TEMPO+-doped HTL ( Fig  5  Table I )  The photoconversion efficiencies were similar to or beyond ( 19 % ) that of the control cell ( 181 ) fabricated with the conventional FK209-doped spiro-OMeTAD HTL after tuning the dopant amount  The added amount of the TEMPO+ dopant in the HTL affected the photo-conversion performance probably due to the appropriate carrier density in HTL  For the perovskite of mixed four cations RbCs ( MA ) ( FA )  combined with the HTL of 30 mol % TEMPO+TFSI−-doped spiro-OMeTAD  the conversion efficiency η reached 201 % with Jsc = 243 mA/cm2  Voc = 104 V  and FF = 079  Table I figure Tab1 Photovoltaic performance  current density ( Jsc )  open circuit potential ( Voc )  fill
